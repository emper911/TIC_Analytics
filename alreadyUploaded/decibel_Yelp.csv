Tony C.}New York, NY}110}13}1}-1}1}5/3/2018}Went on a Friday night at around 1am. I understand it's a busy night, but the overall experience was terrible. We were told a max wait was 20 min, but it turned out to be more like 45 minutes for a party of 5 while other tables (presumably regulars to the bar) got sat right away. One of our party members had to go, but she was cool enough to wait with usAfter we finally got a seat, it was in a dark, dirty, cellar-like place. Which I suppose i can understand again, but then it got worse. I ordered 5 drinks for the table, but since the drinks took so long, our friend had to leave. I asked if we could order 4 instead of the 5, and was flatly rejected, with the server claiming "you already ordered it, bartender is already making it". That's not the correct answer you tell a guest. 1 Star because the shrimp chips were good (they directly bought from neighbor grocery store). But I'll never be back again and encourage you to visit on a non-busy day or not at all. Go to 212 Hisae instead
Danielle M.}New York, NY}365}486}41}18}2}5/1/2018}We experienced horrible service during our second visit to Sake Bar Decibel. We were very rudely kicked out by one of the waiters for not tipping a full 20%. Let's first start off by saying that we were seated at the bar and not a table. Secondly, we probably had two to three different waiters who were not attentive at all until we caught ones attention. Thirdly, we didn't order any food and were actually surprised they couldn't even pour some 2 cent shrimp chips in a bowl for us being that we were on our fourth round of drinks each. Lastly, since when do you tip any bar 20% for a simple pour of alcohol in which no creativity or effort was put into? If the tip is not included, it is OUR right to choose what we want to tip and we were more than enough fair given everything listed. We very much appreciate the food and drink industry and tip very well when it's deserved. We are all hard working, money-earning individuals and for the waiter to tell us that their income comes mostly from tips and it's not proper for us to give less than 20% is absolutely inappropriate. Our fight was very much justified and he proceeded to tell us that if we do not pay the 20% then we would have to leave.Funny enough, I looked up tipping etiquette in Japan and it's not even customary. Very unfortunate that this happened because we really would have continued to come back for sake.
Oleg S.}New York, NY}16}2}1}-1}1}4/28/2018}Decent place with an authentic atmosphere. Was chased by personnel demanding higher tips in absolutely unfavorable manner. The personnel ruined all my experience by their approach. Never coming back to this place. Sadly!
Jeff T.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}4/26/2018}Nice sake list, but blatantly dishonest, self-entitled fraudsters for staff. Just make sure to check your receipt the next day. When we went there, the staff were extraordinarily eager, to the point of repeated and outright rudeness, to kick us out before we even finished our last drink. When we pointed out that we weren't done and held up the sake glass, the host shouted "that's done" at us and stormed away like a teenager with a temper tantrum. Very impressive and  funny in a classic New York kind of way, but it was enough for all of us to zero out our tips. They approached us on our way out and complained that we didn't leave any tip, and so we explained that we don't leave tips when restaurants kick us out prematurely. We were suspicious, so we checked our credit card bills the next day, and no surprise at this point: they fraudulently added in their own 25% tip. That is not acceptable. To be clear, we'll probably go back again because the sake is good, but we will never leave a tip - and will always check our cards.
Cat M.}Brooklyn, NY}219}167}80}18}5}4/8/2018}I love the creativity with having Giant sake bottles if they were on tap. And they really know their sake here, you can debate that. The crowd is really cool and we were lucky to get a seat at the bar but it gets really busy and Saturdays after 11.
Alex F.}Brooklyn, NY}19}18}2}-1}4}3/31/2018}Cool bar, seating is very cramped and food is just okay, but ambience is excellent.  Large sake selection and knowledgable staff. Despite being very crowded and tightly packed, waiters were pretty attentive
Alexa D.}Patchogue, NY}6}6}10}-1}1}3/30/2018}After shuffling down a narrow staircase you open the door to this dump. You squeeze into a dirty musty basement where people are packed in watching bartenders microwave food. Even in the middle of winter this place is sweltering hot. No only is the environment cringe worth this palace has to be in violation of every health and safety code imaginable. There is no way everyone could get out in the event of a fire or accident. We left very shortly after arriving.
Minji K.}Aurora, CO}218}170}507}18}4}3/26/2018}Pictures are deceiving and this joint is tiny, but the wall of sake makes up for it lol sat at the bar, had 2 bottles of sake (wish I caught the name of the sake, but we let the bartender pick for us) skeptical at first to order some food as the microwave was right in front of us, but whatever we were hungry. We ordered shrimp shu mai and a beef bowl - thought the food was decent forbidden it was warmed up in the microwave in front of us =P
R. H.}Los Angeles, CA}4}6}1}-1}2}3/24/2018}I love Sake - and small subterranean bars like this one, so Decibel should have been an easy win. The selection is great and we definitely enjoyed what we ordered, however, we were rushed through our experience, weirdly hounded to tip more even though we had already tipped 20%, and then told frankly that lots of other customers were waiting even though we had only been there for 50-60 minutes and we had spent 150 dollars. rude. made us feel bad about coming here. Will not return.
Romain-Alexis B.}Boston, MA}143}10}2}-1}1}3/21/2018}Rude service. When asking something, they would look at us, answer whatever cross their mind, and escape before we even try to ask a second time. Maybe they don't speak english, I would understand. But that's not even this, it's about attitude. AT LEAST FAKE YOUR CARE ABOUT YOUR CLIENTS OH MY GOD! Never going back.
Miguel B.}Manhattan, NY}25}6}0}-1}3}3/18/2018}I loved the large selection of really good sake, I was blown away by it.... I also loved the okonomiyaki and Wasabi Shumai (wasabi and pork dumplings). HOWEVER, I'm giving it 3 stars because we experienced terrible service: one waiter in particular was SUPER rude all the time, and we had a tiny table but were 4, when we asked for a larger table he was over the top rude, offensive even.Then they were rushing us out at the end, we were finishing conversation and waiting for someone to come out of the bathroom a couple minutes after paying the bill and the rude waiter came to say "they were waiting for the table". I was so offended by it I just said "Yes we're waiting too, you need more bathrooms".It was a good bar, ruined by terrible service. I'm surprised since japanese people really value good service but apparently this bar missed the memo.
Roxane G.}Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, Belgium}0}2}0}-1}1}3/17/2018}I just had the most unpleasant service experience in this bar which I was so excited about... extremely rude waiter !!!!!
Yvonne L.}New York, NY}202}51}83}18}1}3/9/2018}Came here on a Friday night around 9pm. We were very excited because it looks like a pretty  cool bar. We were seated in front of the bar after 15 mins of wait. We were not familiar with sake, so we asked a bartender for recommendations. He (the bartender) had an attitude and just pointed at something at the menu without explaining anything. We figured maybe because he was busy and he had to take care of other things beside making the drinks. But it's just very unfortunate because seating at the bar is an experience, you want to be able to have conversation bartenders. Secondly, this place smelled bad, the bar seats are right across the bathroom, but there is no excuse because the bathroom smelled horrible. We didn't order any food, but were watching a lady making food in front of us the whole time. Most of the food is microwave food. I've been to other Japanese sake bars and cocktail bars in the city. I am very surprised by the level of service this bar is providing. I will not come back again for sure.
Alan W.}New York, NY}411}66}8}18}3}3/9/2018}Came in with high expectations and left rather disappointed. We sat at the bar to get closer to the action of the drink/food prep but should have just sat inside at a regular table. The bartender could have been much more attentive (too busy dealing with checks), and wasn't pleasant when we asked for simple recommendations. Also, pretty much all the food is packaged food that's microwaved, and I'd be surprised if all the plastic packages/ saran wrap/ plastic containers being heated in the microwaves are BPA-free / microwaveable.
Mark G.}Woodmere, NY}186}61}204}-1}5}3/7/2018}-Bathroom -Date friendly Bomb environment, bomb crowd and even better sake. I check this place out after on the hunt for a genuine sake social bar for a while.
Greem J.}New York, NY}100}11}6}-1}5}3/5/2018}Decibel is an underground, experimental and offbeat style sake bar! You can enjoy fresh sashimi, tuna, appetizer tofu, pancakes with good music, sake, grafitti and loud conversation with a lot of friends! Japanese staff is so kind too!
Henry Y.}New York, NY}371}711}1}-1}4}2/26/2018}Cozy little sake bar tucked away in the basement of a building in St Marks, Sake Bar Decibel is a great place to head when you're itching to try some exotic sake. Seating is limited but if you wait long enough / show up at the right time, a party as large as 6-7 can fit in one of the booths. Service is prompt and I'm sure the food's not bad either (though we only got the edamame and some ice cream).
Amanda M.}San Francisco, CA}345}146}126}18}4}2/20/2018}Sake Bar Decibel is a cool little-hidden place when you first walk in it reminds me of golden gai in tokyo. there is more seating in the back. It is 100% a fire hazard in the back room when it is crowded. Those who are claustrophobic- bet not to go. The servers were kind and came by often. The list of sake was nice, larger than most places I've been. The food is quick small bites. Good! Menu of what we :Chicken meatballsudonshrimp dumblingshrimp chips (fries)mild and mellow 16 oz sakecold tofu w boniko flakesjapanese beerloved the cold tofu. the sake was huge. he brought us maybe 18-20oz-- thank you!
Nicole M.}New York, NY}329}8}25}-1}4}2/15/2018}Love love love this place. Menu is really tiny but the tuna sashimi is bomb and the sake is on point. Recommend getting there a little early because they do get pretty crowded. Deff choose sitting inside rathe than at the bar by the entrance. Completely different vibe and honestly eating here is definitely all about the vibe
Alexis P.}New York, NY}280}173}38}-1}3}2/7/2018}Pretty meh, great sake selection. Come here for sake + company, not for food.steamed eel: eel that comes from package, 4 slices of it servedtaco wasabi: standardsalmon ochazuke: where's the salmon?!decibel tofu: lazy version of agedashi tofu (not deep fried)
Julie B.}Manhattan, NY}248}376}195}18}4}2/3/2018}Pretty cool underground spot in NYC's own tiny Little Tokyo. Just look for the blinking "On Air" sign, scoot down the steep steps, and have your ID ready. You'll be whisked away into a subterranean venue that punches far above its weight class. The sake list is extensive and priced at a very reasonable ~2x markup. Service is a little slow but the candlelit and slightly gritty ambiance more than compensates. Order a silo of Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu sake, a savory okonomiyaki whose gooey and slightly fishy goodness can barely be contained by the oodles of spicy mayo topping it, some kurobuta sausage, some seared tuna, and a cucumber salad. Allow yourself to be whisked away by a nice buzz and (hopefully) even better company.
Brittany B.}New York, NY}335}17}3}-1}4}1/29/2018}I love that fact that once you walk in you feel like you've teleported into the gangs of Japan. The saki list is off the hook so it will not be hard to find something you'll like. We wanted to add to the graffiti that's all over the walls so they gave us a permanent marker and we left our stamp which really added to the guest experience.
Addison C.}New York, NY}189}50}94}18}3}1/28/2018}I came here one Friday night with my Buddy to get a drink and talk about life.  My friend took me here which looked like a basement to a very ratchet apartment, but it ended up being a bar location that seem to be very packed and popular.  We did not wait long because there was two spaces left at the bar, however waiting for a table inside will probably take at least 20 minutes to 30 minutes of standing.  The waiting area is literally right next to the bathroom where no one can get in without going through a crowd of people waiting.Food:  I ordered the Lento ($7) it was a very strong drink, Lychee Martini ($9) at first I thought it was going to taste like Lychee, but instead it just smells like Lychee.  The taste was very strong with alcohol.  My friend ordered Edamame ($3) and raw octopus ($6).  The raw octopus just tasted like wasabi which works when you are drinking  I did not like how everything was made with just a microwave, pot, and rice cooker.  Everything literally can be made to go on your own by going to sunrise market. Service: We were seated very quickly, but I did not like how it took so long for the bartender to get our order, and the fact that we have to move every time someone is done and have to leave.  It smells bad inside also because its close to the bathroom.  Overall: The price is not bad for what you get, but everything really adds up quick because they give you the food in small portion.  I will not come back here, unless I have no where else to go in St Marks.
Alan K.}Monterey Park, CA}494}679}10}18}4}1/22/2018}Gooooooooooooooooooooodness their beef bowl just screams of Japan. I know I was hungry, but probably the best beef bowl I've had in the states. The sauce had deep complex flavors thanks to the juices of the beef, sweetness from the onions, and a mix of few sauces that brought all the flavors together. That and their sake selection included one sake that i was trying to locate for many months. The only bad thing was they started to rush us when it got more crowded; so come early if you want a nicer experience.
Bree C.}Manhattan, NY}327}70}67}18}4}1/16/2018}Stopped here last weekend for a few drinks with friends and was very impressed. The outside of the place doesn't look aesthetically pleasing, but the second you walk in, you feel as if you're walking through a forgotten speakeasy or simply a maze of urban art. The staff at Decibel are friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. There was a long wait, but as soon as we sat down, our waiter filled water glasses for us and explained the menu, which offered deliciously crafted cocktails. I would highly suggest the lychee martini --- beautiful presentation and even better taste.
Diane Z.}Brooklyn, NY}232}1091}113}18}3}1/4/2018}A divey basement bar with graffiti on the walls and furniture. The tables are pretty close together so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors. They have some snacks and also have rice burgers from next door. Definitely too much of a dirty grungey vibe for me, but to each their own!
Megha G.}Midtown East, Manhattan, NY}26}25}2}-1}5}12/5/2017}Underground sake bar with a Japanese charm! Absolutely love this place. Stumbled upon it on Saturday evening while looking for cool places to take out of town friends. What a gem! Had a great speakeasy experience. Great staff. If you don't know anything about sake they help you choose from their long list of offering. They have sooooo many sakes on their menu it's crazy. Unique sake experience in the middle of st marks. The best part is kinda hidden so not a lot of people know about it. True local Nyc experience.
Douglas K.}Queens, NY}140}527}1}18}4}12/3/2017}Underground sake bar with a speakeasy kind of feel. They have a crazy sake list and some small plates which is nice for a pre-game spot or after dinner. The place is cramped and small so don't expect to get a table with a large group. Also, this place is kind of a dive so don't be showing up as if you were to go clubbing or you'll definitely stand out. The place gets packed, come small and expect a late. Great place for a date for something different.  Definitely check it out.
Carrie B.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}12/1/2017}Super cool bar with great food and drink and friendly staff. Will definitely be back. Recommend the lychee martini !
Israel R.}Manhattan, New York, NY}68}1}0}-1}1}11/24/2017}I just got the Yelp app in order to give a bad review to a place which really deserves it. The waitresses were nice in general, however the rest of the staff, including the manager and bartender gave us terrible service.We left the place giving a 10% tip (only because the waitresses gave a good service), only to find a confrontation at the entrance where customer satisfaction was clearly trying to be subdued by aggressive waiting tips.This has been one of my worst experiences in this city. Do not go to this place.
Gerardo M.}Manhattan, NY}117}10}0}-1}1}11/24/2017}What an unfortunate and threatening experience. After some rude gestures by the barman and one of the waiters, our party decided to leave 10% tip (we did not leave zero because two of our waitresses were actually nice, as opposed to all the guys).As we left, we were surrounded and confronted by the waiters, who were either drunk, high, or both.  We eventually managed to leave... not before being told by one of them that I would never again be welcome there and he would remember my face forever. Sorry guys, we would never even consider going back. If you like feeling safe and you like friendly service AVOID this place.
Nicole B.}New York, NY}215}126}3}-1}5}11/24/2017}Be prepared for a wait! This is my new favorite bar in NYC, hands down. Located on a charming block in EV that transports you to Japan. The small plates are delicious and the lychee martini is strong. Every sake I've ordered so far has been a winner, the descriptions on the menu are spot on.
Jessica H.}New York, NY}92}58}266}18}4}11/24/2017}Yum yum. Nice place for a Friday night hang out with friends and get drunk. It's a really low-key restaurant located in the basement. Though the space seems a little limited, the food is good. Decibel has the authentic Japanese bar culture. I had the YUZU for drink, a sweet taste alcohol, tasting like sweet plum. For food, I love the salted edamame, and the Gyo Don is great. It's very easy to walk pass by the restaurant without noticing it. Just bookmark and try here.
Florence N.}New York, NY}2}72}6}-1}2}11/21/2017}Good fir kids.Tight, noisy spot, very small kitchen, most of it reheated in a microwave. Nice selection of sakis tho.
Solange D.}Bronxville, NY}2}66}2}-1}4}11/20/2017}What fun! A very cool space, with good food n drinks. My only take back was the prices are a lil high for some of the ridiculously small portion sizes.
Catherine C.}New York, NY}230}125}170}18}3}11/19/2017}The drinks are no frills and straightforward but still manage to be lovely. The service is a nightmare-I was chilling in the line waiting for a spot to open up and read up a review on how they chase you for more tip. I looked up and wow, it was happening right in front of me. This was real.After you order drinks, the servers really hustle. They keep coming trying to take empty glasses away and asking you what you are ordering next. When you say you are done ordering, the bill immediately comes. Um, what? At least be reasonable to let us finish those drinks we just ordered!The automatic tip amount starts at 18%, which we did and did not get chased after. We think that those who made their own tip at lower than that at the fill in your own amount  probably get chased after, but honestly, if you don't want low tip then you shouldn't include that fill in your own line. It's absurd to chase after customers for more tip.Very hot space but the line moves fast on a weekend night when all bars are very very full. This makes sense once you get a table and it's apparent they hustle you to order lots of drinks then gtfo. Would love to try more of the drinks here but idk about this kind of service...
Carina C.}New York, NY}169}393}450}-1}4}11/13/2017}Cool spot. It's an interesting experience. Be prepared to wait for a table/bar seat. This place is not a hidden gem and it gets busy. It's a lot better to wait a bit longer for a table than to be squished at the bar. Bartender will not think twice about telling you to move when anyone has to come and go. Sitting at the bar also allows you to see the food "prep" which is kinda amusing given the very small space and excessive use of the microwave. Don't expect a gourmet meal if you order any kind of food. Just grab a snack and lower your expectations. Lots of sake options, because that's what you come here for. Good sake cocktails. I'd suggest the Melonball.
Diyang Y.}New York, NY}207}80}95}18}5}11/8/2017}If you're looking for a cute date place, or just a place to chill with friends, this is your place. Sake Bar Decibel is very intimate, with dim lighting, and very hip wall art. The ambiance is just chilllll.The sake is excellent, with so many options you'll probably start spinning (that or because of the alcohol), and the service is excellent as well. They relocated my party of five to a larger table once it was freed.Overall, I have come back several times, and will continue to do so in the future!
Mark C.}Surprise, AZ}0}3}0}-1}5}11/5/2017}This place is awesome. Some of the previous, less than stellar, reviews may be justified, but my only complaint would be the price of certain items. I had an amazing server who took the time to educate me on every kind of sake imaginable, and recommended GEMS! The sake was amazing, yes, it was a bit pricey, but it's NYC! The atmosphere was awesome, small basement space, but very reminiscent of the small cramped, but amazing, places you can find on a random back street in Tokyo! I highly recommend this place! Ask for Kota as your server if he is around; he is awesome!
Angela J.}Washington, DC}70}82}220}18}3}11/5/2017}Cool underground bar. Unfiltered sake a bit limited. Sparkling sake was not what I expected. Busy with a small wait on Friday night. Only bar seats, lots of shuffling to let people in and out. We were weirdly watching someone microwave pre-prepared meals at the bar next to the door. Made me feel a little queasy, watching all that prepackaged food being microwave heated and sent out. I'd never order from somewhere where I could see that at the bar! Ambiance is great. Good for post dinner drinks and for small groups. There was a back but didn't get to visit.
Rui T.}Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY}104}10}4}-1}5}11/1/2017}The only downside was the night I went has really bad AC. Drink was good, definitely love the atmosphere!
César B.}Brooklyn, NY}84}2}5}-1}2}10/27/2017}WARNING - SCAM ARTISTS!!!Great atmosphere, but a**hole server chased me as I was exiting the bar to demand a larger tip. Hey buddy, if you just hand me a bottle of overpriced sake without any real service, don't expect me to pay a larger tip.
Jina L.}New York, NY}2}9}6}-1}5}10/21/2017}Small hole-in-the-wall kind of place with the most extensive sake list of any bar I've been to in NYC. Wish their bathrooms were cleaner, but service was good and they have a reasonably priced selection of some excellent sakes. Will definitely be back again soon.
Jennifer Y.}Palo Alto, CA}43}64}3}-1}1}10/18/2017}Don't come here. The servers were really concerned that I'd write them a positive Yelp review, and that I'd be back to spend another $150 here. (I'm not kidding; they wouldn't let me leave because they were concerned I'd be back. Yes I am as confused as you.) So, over and out: DO NOT COME HERE!!! The service is terrible, and the sake isn't even good.We ordered a $63 bottle of sake for 8 and were ready to head out to grab our table at Veselka, but then were told we needed to meet a drink minimum... so we hastily ordered another bottle and hurried to make our reservation. We were only there for 30 minutes and felt unfairly treated, so we only left a 10% tip. When we tried to leave again, we were held hostage and rudely asked to tip more. When I asked why can't I leave, one server said "I'm worried you'll come back" (wut??????)The cherry on top is that we asked a different server about the "drink minimum" and he didn't know what we were talking about. TLDR: spent 30 minutes here and were squeezed for more money twice. Seating sucked, service sucked, oh and the sake sucked.
Yin H.}Redwood City, CA}81}416}119}18}5}10/10/2017}Unique, underground sake bar (feels a bit speakeasy ish). Tiny intimate space, cool ambiance, lots of options for beer and sake as well as bites to eat. Doorman was friendly and even turned on his flashlight to help us navigate the steep steps to the door. Waiting area is small but thankfully, wait wasn't that long. The only complaint is the smell of urine in the waiting area emanating from the restrooms. Unfortunately, I had to use the restroom which was surprisingly clean but please resolve the smell issue. It's extremely unpleasant to be cramped in a tiny space with no fresh air. The HANNYA TOU is really special - it's a plum liquor that's a sweet and spicy blend. Great for after dinner sipping!
David C.}Coral Gables, FL}248}2}0}-1}5}10/9/2017}Great sake, great vibes and a really amazing place to start the night! I would recommend this establishment to anyone.
Cynthia O.}Queens, Queens, NY}45}5}10}-1}4}10/5/2017}Small hidden basement sake bar in east village. Went there at 8pm alone and still have to wait for 30 mnts. After 30 mnts was told for party of 1 i only can seat at the bar which is fine. Love their selection of sake, try tako wasa and some of their "heavy" meal. Tako wasa was great but the heavy meal is not heavy at all. Just go there for the sake and u will love it
Priyesh P.}Houston, TX}332}66}9}18}4}9/29/2017}I am writing this review based just on the drinks and decor.  That being said, I loved this place. My cousin took me here because he knows I'm a huge sake fan and this place was amazing.  All the decor and the staff made it seem like I was in Japan again.  They were so friendly and had tons of sake to choose from.  I loved the selections, but the prices were a bit over board.  A bottle of sake is about 150, but it's a 1.6 liter bottle.  I would love yo go back and try the food.
Cam C.}Costa Mesa, CA}546}605}1016}18}4}9/23/2017}If my friend wasn't a NY local, I would've never been able to locate this place. It's a hidden awning in the middle of nowhere with some steep steps. I mean I could easily stumble down them pre-drinking. It was dark when we finally opened the door inside, my eyes had to adjust. Straight from a horror film. We were led through some dark hallway which led to a larger darker room. They wouldn't let us sit at the bar, but instead crammed us into a small table for two even though there were three of us. The waitress came around and was irritated since we didn't now what we wanted. I mean, it's a bible of sake, I'm going to need some time to decipher everything.I had no idea what I ordered but I found something "fruity" and decided why not. I don't know anything about sake, but I was very happy with everything our cramped table ordered. Certain sake they bring out a small square, placed an ice cold glass in it, then pour the drink until it overflows. I don't consider myself a light weight, but having finished my drink and two sips of my friend's, I had a nice buzz going. I wanted to try more but I didn't want to end up stumbling out of there, up those steep stairs.
Gregory C.}New York, NY}87}168}28}18}4}9/17/2017}While roaming the city late one night I was very much undecided where to go.  I had previous places where I could go but I really wanted to try out a new place.  A quick search led me to Decibel.  This is a hidden bar that no doubt people have unknowingly walked past before as it is in the basement of the building.  Once you enter you are in the main bar and prep area.  Customers are instructed to wait for the hostess. The main seating area is further back past a corridor. That area has some bar seating along with tables. It is very dark in that room but it seems to be able to accommodate a good amount of people as well as large parties.  There were two main servers taking care of everyone - a hard working gentleman and a lady wearing the traditional kimono. Service was very prompt and courteous.  They specialize obviously in their alcoholic beverages but but they do have small plates of Japanese food and appetizers. I ordered quite a few dishes including the chashu, tsukune, chazuke, lychee and mochi.  No issues with the dishes. This place definitely deserves five stars based upon my visit. What really got me a bit annoyed was that I was still hungry. The staff assumed that I was done ordering and brought me the bill instead of asking if I wanted anything else.  I guess it was the universe telling me that i should just save my money for that particular evening. This is a great spot and I would recommend it to anyone visiting the East Village.
Hugh M.}Montclair, NJ}0}111}0}-1}2}9/17/2017}food isn't very good. looks shady as hell. cramped. feels sticky. bathroom is shitty and cramped
Mike A.}New York, NY}2}23}19}-1}5}9/6/2017}WMM ( Worth My Money) Rating 5 out of 5I love this place! Well, I admit I'm a bit bias since Sake and a Sapporo is my go to drink. Trendy decor a bit small but they fit groups nicely in their location. The most sake choices I have ever scene - Clear/ Dry/ Cloudy/ Warm in flask/ Chilled in box. Food selection is decent and they have a lot of options too if you're hungry. Service was great - they are very attentive and quick for your food. The place does get packed so watch out for a line to get in.Lots of great places on St. Marks- but this is one of my Favs! So grab your date or your friends and get there this weekend... you won't regret it.
Gina Z.}Southeast, Las Vegas, NV}1}10}1}-1}1}9/3/2017}Absolutely terrible and disgusting customer service! And they even yelled at us for tipping what was reflective of their poor service! One of my girlfriends was so pissed about their bad service that she gave ZERO tip. A lady then ran after her. Instead of asking "what's wrong with their service" so that they can improve, she immediately said "Don't ever come back again!!!" But then later, she modified the $ amount on her own and charged my friend more than 20% tips on her credit card after we left! How disgusting?! Never going back!
Elizabeth Y.}Bronx, NY}132}450}200}18}4}9/2/2017}I love this place! I came here over 10 years ago when I first visited New York City. Followed my friends and didn't pay attention to the name or location of the venue but I got my first lychee martini! It was so good and I just assumed I'd never come back to NYC again. Now 10 years later I'm living here and it made me sad to think that I'd never find this place or maybe it had closed. Well.... decibel was not done with me. By chance my friend took me here and I immediately recognized the stairs, the interior design, and.... wait for it... the lychee martini!!!!This place is cramped and they'll try to do their best in maximizing.
Alex V.}New York, NY}0}22}5}-1}2}8/30/2017}Pros: Great vibes, trendy ambiance. Even better, the sake list is top-notch; arguably one of the best in the city. I really love how low-key the entrance is.Cons: Everything else. I went with a group of five other friends and were squeezed into an extraordinarily small table, but hey, this is New York. I can get past that. What I can't get past is the blatantly slow service and the rude attitude from almost every employee I had an interaction with. Though it's never happened to me in the few times I've been there, I've actually seen customers get harassed and run out of the place for having the bravery to tip what they considered fair for the terrible service. I've also seen empty glasses get pulled out of hands with sake still left on the table. Though I'm a huge fan of the sake list and the overall feel of the place, I'm a little shocked and angry at how terribly the staff treats their customers. As great as the sake menu was, you should skip this place.
Benjamin D.}Saratoga Springs, NY}0}11}1}-1}1}8/25/2017}TL;DR: Buzzfeed / Thrillist tourist trap themed bar. Great food and drinks, TERRIBLE service. Never going back. Great food and great atmosphere. Have been here many times without trouble, but have heard that they sometimes will "yell" at customers for tipping too low. I never had that issue until recently. Came with a party of four and racked up a relatively large bill, the service we were provided with was confusing as we were working with four or five different waiters; but they were efficient enough. Although they were almost never present, they brought the food and drinks out eventually. We left a tip which we thought was reflective of our experience, and we were quite explicitly made fools of by the staff upon trying to leave the restaurant. I said I would adjust the tip if they felt they deserved a higher tip, and as I was trying to adjust the tip I was still being yelled at. He asked if I "go around NYC tipping everyone bad" and I said "No, this is the first time I ever had to tip someone so poorly because of terrible service!"Tips are based off experience and you should not hold your customers hostage by making them feel like they have a moral obligation to tip you more. Among other things, the man working told me he needed me to tip more so he could pay his rent. After holding us there for 5 minutes or so I left without adjusting the tip.  Very unattractive business model in this respect. Service aside, great food and sake. Probably my last experience there, sadly! Never going back!
Nolan D.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}8/20/2017}I agree with the previous reviews. This place has terrible service. I came in with friends and sat down. Not only were we greeted by rude wait staff that barely looked at us or cared, but we asked them for a recommendation for sake, given the list that we were given around $30 bottles. Their recommendation turned out to be a $90 bottle that we didn't know until the bill came out. Then, they didn't service us the whole night. Then I saw at the table next to us, they had stopped the group from leaving because their tip was less than adequate, probably because of their bad service that I had witnessed myself. And they demanded the group pay more. That's ABSURD.  Rude wait staff who knows they can get away with it because of the popularity of the place and overpriced drinks.
Jim Z.}Los Angeles, CA}0}1}0}-1}2}8/18/2017}Came here as part of the trip to the Big Apple. The bar was underground, had very unique decor and ambience with a large selection of drinks, but the positives stopped there. The drinks were way overprice. The service and food were mediocre; not up to par with Japanese standards. For those well-versed in Japanese cuisine, beware to lower your expectations here.
Amin S.}Milwaukee, WI}121}6}0}-1}1}8/18/2017}This bar was extremely rude to me and my friends. The staff was highly disrespectful and overcharged us.  Then they harassed one of my friends for "not tipping enough".  That's incredibly unprofessional and we will never go here again.
Victoria S.}New York, NY}324}108}48}18}5}8/18/2017}This is my favorite bar in NYC! Such a cool, gritty vibes. It is underground and has lots of graffiti all over the walls. I'm not the biggest fan of dive bars, my friend said that this is a dive bar, but I disagree. Anyways.. fun energy, good crowd, and good drinks! The sake is amazing and you can get it by the glass or bottle. It is great for a fun date night or small group of friends. It does get crowded and a line forms outside (it's kind of a small place) so try to get there a little early.
Sara P.}Los Angeles, CA}411}133}248}-1}4}8/13/2017}Want to feel like you're in Japan? Possibly under the train tracks in Yurakucho or even the famed Golden Gai? Then come here to Sake Bar Decibel. They've got a loooooong Sake list and others too. Had to get the umeshu with soda which is my go-to whenever I'm at an izakaya. Lighting + ambience is sexy, it's the right amount of derelict and something you'd typically come across in Japan. Took of a star due to the food. Only thing I enjoyed were the purple potato fries and okonomiyaki but even those two dishes could've been better. Shrimp siumai is straight out of the frozen section of an Asian grocery, make your moolah stretch by doing yourself a favor and not ordering ebi shumai from here.
Nathalie S.}Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, NY}0}39}10}-1}4}8/13/2017}Came here with a group of friends after dinner in the east village and it was a great find. The entrance is down a set of stairs from street level and a little hard to spot. Place is small but felt very authentically Japanese. An incredible selection of sake and the sake cocktails were very tasty too. And they gave us a free raw octopus with wasabi to try with our drinks. Awesome spot!
Judy M.}New York, NY}6}13}0}-1}4}7/26/2017}A classic of the East Village, Decibel is a great Japanese sake dive, tucked below stairs, covered in graffiti, unpretentious, boisterous and boasting an impressive selection of sake, soju and Japanese nibbles at very decent prices. My one wish on a hot Summer night was for better AC and for the beer to be served in a frosty glass as opposed to just the bottle. But I'm nitpicking. This is one cool New York joint.
Connie L.}New York, NY}30}329}136}18}3}7/19/2017}Came here on a Thursday night and to my surprise it was quite packed (but no wait!). The crowd has also changed since the last time I came here two years ago.Underground and beyond the bar in the entrance, you'll be ushered into the larger room that's tightly packed and very dimly lit. There's more bar seating here as well as tables for two that they manage to pack 4 on, but this adds to the urban feel lols.My friend and I got a bottle of sake (cause what else would you get here??). The list is extensive and descriptive, so take your time reading  to see what you want. We also got the purple potato fries - these were amazing. They were crispy and lightly seasoned which went well the its natural sweetness. Service was slow and nonchalant even though the ratio of servers to guests was a good number. It took a while to wave someone down to order and get the check.
Tatiana B.}Seattle, WA}0}6}0}-1}5}7/18/2017}Great place for the casual dive bar experience with good drinks and food.
Matt M.}Manhattan, NY}33}58}146}18}3}7/16/2017}Sake Bar Decibel is a trendy, fun (albeit cramped) spot to grab sake (kind of redundant on that point) and light snacks.  This is an underground basement bar with dark lighting and graffiti littered walls.The service was gruff and a bit pretentious.  We found our server to be rough around the edges.  That said, this place gets packed on a Saturday night and I can't say I blame her.We nibbled on the Ebi Shumai and this sausage that I can only best describe as a mix between kielbasa and a miniature hot dog weenie (can't recall the name of the dish, sorry).  Both were outstanding!  I docked two stars on the service.  I would definitely come back though.  Cool concept!
Clementine G.}Washington, DC}4}18}4}-1}5}7/12/2017}Love the vibe at this place! I haven't gotten the food but the drinks are delicious! In addition to a whole sake bar they have good cocktails. It's small so definitely come with a group of 4 or less. Feels like being in a small Japanese Bar in Tokyo!
Dawon L.}Brooklyn, NY}30}2}0}-1}2}7/10/2017}super crowded. Came with a party of 4, and they made us sit at a table designed for 2 people. Food is ok.
Carmen W.}New York, NY}111}206}173}18}5}7/10/2017}we gotebi shu mai-shrimp dumpling- this is "shu mai" type of dessert. So good, you'll wish they had an entree portion for thisfried purple potato-these were so good. def the "spud" muffin of the night. You know the terra chips? these are MUCH better than those. soba- i was kind of iffy about getting this. But "soba-lessed" to have ordered it. My dining companion had never tried soba before, and fell in love with it as well. okonomiyaki- pancake-this is one of their popular dishes and it def deserves to be. If you're ever feeling like "crepe," this can def "flip" your mood back around.The inside is pretty cool. They have a bunch of graffiti everywhere-even the ceilings! The wait can get kinda long, but DO NOT settle and sit at the bar. You NEED to go downstairs to eat. It's so much better. IThe place is kinda small, i wouldnt come here with a big group-as in they'd probably squish 6 of you at a table for 4. We were a party of two and we even had problem fitting our food on our table.
Karry L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}467}263}18}4}7/8/2017}Once you find the entrance which leads you to the basement, it appears to be divey bar vibe but it's actually not, small tiny tables lined up against the wall in a dark litted basement, there's small bites on the menu but it was not our objective, my buddy's mission was to have me taste a multiple sake til I find one to my satisfaction, first one: ok I don't hate the taste, second one: it's better, smoother, third one: I kinda like it. It was 60% processed wakatake! Servers are very friendly, I love how they over pour the sake glass and it flows into the square wooden cup holding the original glass! It's supposed to be a traditional way of pouring sake!
Chloe C.}Austin, TX}45}104}23}18}5}7/3/2017}Amazing menu of sake in a truly unique and special environment. A highlight of our trip to NYC!!
Sterling M.}New York, NY}0}10}0}-1}1}7/3/2017}Avoid at all costs. There are better tourist traps in which to waste your money.I used to love this place but sexism abounds and the staff test the limits of rudeness stopping just short of direct snacks to the face.I've been going here off and on since 1997, first as a local, and now when I have old friends in town who remember the 90's, or when I have tourists in town who complain that the east village doesn't look like it does in books. I have spent a lot of money in this fake mars bar wannabe over the last 20 years.So anyway the other evening I went here with two friends. First of all there was some asshole behind "the rope" (time to get rid of that) shouting at us to move forward and enter as if a) it was hard to find a table at 5.30 pm and b) this basement bar was somehow exclusive. Anyway we laugh that off as some tourist trap shenanigans and go to our matchbox sized table where we order a lot of drinks and snacks. I love sake, and I like Japanese bar food. However I don't like sullen wait staff who act like they woke up from a feverish nightmare only to find that the nightmare was reality and they do in fact work in a themed tourist bar for moles. Maybe they need to get out of the basement a little more. Service is brutal.So it comes time to leave. We pay and leave a 20% tip which was about 15% too much. My friend goes to the bathroom as I wait. Then I go to the bathroom "area" which is very unhygienically located right in the "exclusive" entrance way. There are two bathrooms, one for males and one for females. Anyway men are just bouncing past me and another woman as we wait patiently outside the female bathroom. Eventually I get tired of this nonsense and step in front of a man and say "you will have to wait until after me". I go into the men's bathroom and lock the door. I ALMOST puked as the toilet was half full of shit and vomit. I decided to pee anyway. Hard core bladder. Afterwards I go back to my table to pick up my friend and belongings. Cue "tiny bouncer from the rope" to our table rapping with his knuckles saying he needs our table. Um we were already leaving you dick. I am assuming you are either a) mad that I broke some bathroom male:female etiquette or b) thinking I filled your already dirty toilet with shit and vomit.If a) and just in general, your toilets need to be unisex. Move into modern times and remember where your establishment is located. If b) maybe if you checked your toilets occasionally instead of hopping up and down behind that curtain tie like a coked up power mad garden gnome, you would have a more hospitable establishment. I will never be back. What a shit hole.
Philip N.}New York, NY}8}147}25}-1}5}6/28/2017}If you enjoy drinking sake, then you must go explore this place. The venue is so cool. You head underground into a small tucked away room. The menu features countless bottles of sake for any type of palate. The service is always great, and the atmosphere is fantastic. Go and explore the menu and enjoy your time at this spot.
Jae Won Y.}Fort Lee, NJ}0}3}0}-1}1}6/26/2017}I am not the one who usually leaves reviews. But, that was really unpleasant experience.I and my company went there last Saturday. And ordered 2 large bottles of sake. We enjoyed, till the servers kept checking the bottle. My friend was tired and looked  drowsy.Then one of the server(not sure he is server or host) grabbed his arm and asked us out. Even though we had sake left. I told him that I would take care of him. So, don't need to worry about us. And also, I wanted to finish my sake. He said okay then he came back in 2 minutes, asked us out again. My Saturday night out was totally ruined.I will never go back.Don't waste your night out at this horrible place.
Jackie M.}Brooklyn, NY}311}148}74}18}5}6/24/2017}I wish I had never given a 5 star yelp review before because then I could perhaps maaayybe Express how truly wonderful this place is. Its like this amazing Japanese dive rock and roll bar with amaaaaaazing food. If you're lucky, you'll get a seat at the teeny tiny bar upstairs and you'll feel like the princess of the apocalypse. Go and appreciate the atmosphere but have some respect and don't wear boat shoes.
Luis R.}New York, NY}3}32}127}-1}5}6/24/2017}Cool atmosphere up on the bar area, downstairs is pretty cool too. Nice musical selecrion, the food is delicious.
Chihiro T.}Manhattan, NY}3}3}0}-1}1}6/23/2017}I'm Japanese, and I'm embarrassed (and mad). This bar might appear to be Japanese, but it's anything but. Service this terrible isn't acceptable in Japan, and I don't expect it in New York either.Unreliable wait times, slammed glasses, waiters who are nonexistent unless they're hovering over your checks?No, thank you. We will never be back.
Gabrielle B.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}6/16/2017}I came here with a date on a whim on a Thursday night. The bar is cramped and loud, but I liked the atmosphere; you really feel like you're in a special underground world. That is, until we were rudely kicked out for no reason.We ordered four glasses of sake and paid for our order. My date and I were speaking at a normal volume--quite low compared to the overall noise. After a few minutes, our server asked us if we wanted to order a drink. We said no. He came back soon after and asked again. Then a new server asked us. After about twenty minutes, we were told by a woman I presumed to be the owner that we had to leave unless we ordered drinks--yet we had already ordered and paid for sake, and there was literally nobody waiting for a table, AND there were empty tables near us. We got up to leave after she kept insisting it. The server pretended to be hit by my chair, and then all three servers began loudly chanting Go, Go, Go! at us as we evacuated. I wanted to like this place, but this was the worst, most disrespectful service I've experienced in a bar of this kind. And it's sad. If the owners were more respectful, this would be a lovely spot for a kind of simultaneous intimacy and seclusion. But as it is, it's horrible. I do not recommend it. This place's employees gives any bar a bad name.
Amanda K.}Los Angeles, CA}1141}428}838}18}4}6/7/2017}As other reviews have stated, this place is cramped, dark and intimate. With an urban underground feel and markings/graffiti on the walls, it's a really cool bar - would only come here with 4 people MAX.We came here after a friend suggested it, saying it's the best sake he had (after Japan). We came on a Friday night so it was pretty busy. Servers were quickly walking around to each table but each were nice and very knowledgeable.I've never been to a place with this much sake. The selection was impressive and overwhelming! They all sorts of flavors from bitter to try to sweet and smooth. My friends and I each got one and decided to share. Love that they put the glasses in wooden boxes and over pour!Great spot to get the night started and catch up with friends.
Sally W.}Chinatown, Manhattan, NY}136}3}1}-1}2}6/3/2017}The ambience is nice but the service is bad. We haven't finished the drinks they already started to give checks and tried to make us leave faster. I understand there was a line waiting to enter the bar but you should figure out another way to sit them down instead of pushing out the people who are already in and having the drinks
Brian R.}Washington, DC}141}81}9}18}5}5/31/2017}It doesn't get much better than this.  Great food and good drinks.  Also the ambiance is fantastic, you would think you were in Japan in the 1950s.  A perfect place to rest, relax and
Action A.}Toronto, Canada}0}19}4}-1}1}5/31/2017}This used to be my favorite sake spot. Not any more.  We were so unimpressed with the service: no water refills, lazy sake recommendations, no checking up on us and a bunch of things on our bill we didn't order.  We didn't tip - this is super rare, resulting in even more attitude. Oh, did I mention the attitude? Lots of it.
Michelle H.}Houston, TX}526}662}677}-1}4}5/29/2017}Very cool hipster underground sake bar. Very small, dark, and loud. Graffiti everywhere! We felt out of place because we were dressed up coming back from the theater. Obviously lots of options for sake but they also serve really good snacks. We tried the sashimi (salmon, tuna, and yellowtail), as well as the chicken meatballs and shrimp dumplings. Sashimi was really good but could've done without the meatballs and dumplings.
Jianing Q.}Florence, Italy}3}5}0}-1}1}5/24/2017}The recipient just disappeared. We have waited for 20 minutes. A couple behind us got a seat before we do, and we are left on the waiting bench until the recipient led us to a really bad seat without any explanations. This is an exemplary bad service for seating. I would not recommend to come to here again.
Carol L.}New York, NY}650}266}827}18}4}5/24/2017}We followed up a nice dinner with a chill night at Sake decibel. I'd never heard of this place, and after a failed attempt to get seating at Angel's Share (somewhere I've been to multiple times but haven't successfully tried yet because of all the people who have the same idea as me and intelligently got there before me to grab a seat), we walked on over to Sake decibel. My friend is born and bred New Yorker, and LES-er at that so he said this would have a similar vibe that I was going for. It's kind of sketchy walking down the stairs, but once inside you're transported to another world. There's soft music playing in the background, and the area where you wait in line is adjacent to the bar, which has masks and sake barrels lining the walls of the bar. There was a small line when we went, which went by pretty quickly (20 minutes). When it was our turn to grab a table, the hostess led us to the back room which was almost completely dark save for the giant red lanterns scattered around the room. It was rowdy, people were having a blast, and I was excited to try some sake (I know nothing about it). We were seated at the back bar, which was fine because there was more lighting to read the menus. My friend ordered us two, one slightly fruitier tasting and the other slightly sweeter. I preferred the sweeter, and so had that one. Definitely had a good buzz going after that drink! I'll be back again, if I'm in LES and want a cozy little speakeasy to chill at.
Jennifer C.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}1}5/11/2017}Just awful service. Not only the waiters are inattentive, but also told us "don't come back here if you're unhappy with the service." The sake was alright but super cramped and uncomfortable. Don't come here if you don't want to get cold water in the face
Sam V.}New York, NY}80}145}352}-1}5}5/10/2017}Never a disappointment. My go to spot for sake. Interior is mad interesting. Service always seems to be on point, attentive, and friendly (I go early so service may be different later in the evening). I honestly just dig the chill vibe of this sakebar
Felicia B.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}3}5/7/2017}Very cool spot but if you're not Asian you can pretty much expect a huge wait for your food and drinks. Worth a shot!
Terri T.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}5/5/2017}This is the first time I've ever written a review on Yelp because the service was ridiculously bad. The male waiter (who checks your ID at the front) is absolutely impatient and disrespectful for no reason. He gave us the worst attitude I could ever imagine receiving from a waiter. When he saw us leaving little tip (because of his bad service) he literally told us to not go back again. I will definitely not go back again and really don't recommend anyone to go there unless you're prepared to be served so poorly.
Jessica Y.}Boston, MA}285}1}0}-1}1}5/5/2017}The bar is small and not very clean. They squeezed me and my friends in a very small table when there were clearly other available tables throughout the night. Service was also pretty bad. Would not recommend this bar.
Sammi W.}Burnaby, Canada}82}1}0}-1}1}5/5/2017}Worst service ever. I don't understand why I need to receive bad service and disrespect when I am a paying customer. Would not recommend this bar!
Susannah H.}Minneapolis, MN}255}197}220}18}5}5/5/2017}Love. Love love love. And I'm insanely jealous of everyone in NYC to have a place this amazing to go to. Why so much love:1. Ambiance: dark, strange, intimate, lively2. Sake:  well obviously!  I love sake and this bar definitely lives up to it's name. Huge, varied selection. I don't remember which I had, but it was lovely and dry with a clean finish. Ugh!  Writing this is making me sad.  Damn you, NYC!3. Food: izakaya-type fare. Snack-able and very shareable. Tasty too!  I think we had tuna....hahaha lot of sake at that point. 4. Staff: super friendly and knowledgeable. Yeah not sure what else you could possibly want from a bar, let alone a unicorn like this. Dammit. So insanely jealous!
Airan L.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}278}5}8}-1}1}5/4/2017}Worst service ever. Literally told us not to come back for not tipping enough (because again worst service ever??).
Alana V.}Chicago, IL}0}8}0}-1}1}5/4/2017}As I was leaving, I overheard the host questioning a girl why she had only left a 10% tip -- she said the service was terrible (I almost chimed in to agree with her) and then he responded "Never come back here again". Touché sir.
Catherine C.}Flatiron, Manhattan, NY}355}64}97}-1}1}5/4/2017}This is the bar that has the worst service in the entire NYC. Two of my friends and I (total of 3 people) went to the bar but we were put into a two seat table that was very squashed. Although there were other larger tables available, the server did not allow us to move to those tables. Moreover, the attitude of a male server (who seemed like the lead waiter/ manager) was extremely disrespectful and obnoxious. When I leave the man literally said "Please don't ever come back again as we will not have space for you".
Jenny W.}New York, NY}20}595}133}-1}3}5/1/2017}The ambience here is amazing. Super hidden, really unique vibe, feels like you stepped into an underground bar in Japan (if you ignore the clientele). I initially thought I had wandered into the wrong place, because the entrance has a rope that separates you from the hallway that takes you to the inside seating area.I would not come here for dinner / food. They were missing half of their menu when I came - no okonomiyaki or any of the tofu products. We ended up getting:Gyu-don - good but very fattyWasabi dumplings - interesting... very strong wasabi flavor that I wasn't a fan of, forces you to eat it in small intermittent bitesGreen tea salmon rice - also interesting... and definitely not in a good way. They pour green tea over the rice, so that it's soaking the rice, and then there are flakes of rather salted salmon in the rice. Perhaps an acquired taste, but I wasn't a fan.Eel - Very fatty pieces of eel that tastes good if you eat it immediately when it comes out, but not quite as good if you let it cool. That's when you eat it and realize that it's all fat and very little meat.Burdock root and carrot - A bit spicy and wasn't a big fan of the flavors. Sesame + green tea ice cream - Green tea ice cream was too bitter. Sesame was pretty good.I'd only come here for their extensive sake menu. Eat elsewhere.
Jay L.}Manhattan, NY}55}11}0}-1}1}4/29/2017}Horrible horrible service, at a disrespectful level.1) Forced onto a tiny table for party of 3 while there were multiple bigger tables available, nope cant give them to us after requesting nicely twice. I know NYC tend to offer smaller tables but that one was 12inches by 12inches max, cmon for 3? 2) Tiny table came with 2 seats with backrests and one cheap plastic chair without back rest. I asked to replace the plastic chair with a backseat chair that were not occupied at other table cuz my back was feeing quiet uncomfortable. Of course i was told no with a ready to fight me attitude. Waiter specifically told me, "everyone wants to be comfortable, y u need to be special. U can leave if u dont like". Wtf? Am i at a restaurant or bootcamp?Sake selection was big, hence the name, but u better not have any special accommodations. Be ready to dine as they are paying u money , not the other way around.
Dannie D.}Manhattan, NY}135}44}4}-1}5}4/23/2017}Love the underground (literally) and lively vibe of this tiny spot. Amazing sake list paired with old school hiphop. We loved all the food items sampled (veggie options FTW). Very friendly and helpful staff despite a packed house. Great place to hang out, snack, share a few bottles with your group. Most likely a 20-30 min wait but certainly worth it.
Ree W.}New York, NY}3}16}6}-1}5}4/21/2017}Sweet spot to hang out with friends.  They have a great selection of sake (not that im an expert on sake) and the snacks are good.  The staff are very friendly.
Mark C.}Brooklyn, NY}318}272}1550}-1}4}4/15/2017}It's about the sake. If your ordering by the glass don't freak out when the server overflows it and it spills into the container placed underneath there's a name for it.. 'sosogi-koboshi' and yep that means overflow it's a 300 something year old tradition.. you can pour it back into the glass from the box below, don't waste sake.Be back for some shochu & broiled stingray fin.
Celia N.}Brooklyn, NY}11}106}283}18}4}4/13/2017}3.5 . This place has a wonderful atmosphere. Semi hidden beyond a rope when you descend down the stairs from the street, it has a wonderfully​ grunge aesthetic, with writing on the walls and ceiling, and a very casual vibe. I got some warm sake. Nice selection, though the serving was a bit small. I got the mochi in chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and mango. Vanilla was my favorite. I got these thin, sweet potato fries which were crunchy and sweet, perfect bar food. I also got another sweet potato dish, I cannot understand it's name on the menu, but it was so so. Come here for the atmosphere, decor, sake and mochi. Not a place for a nice, decent meal.
Albert C.}Brooklyn, NY}38}7}0}-1}4}4/12/2017}If you are looking for an original sake experience with a modern twist and a NY edge, this is it.  Huge selection and fantastic service.
Michelle L.}NY, NY}145}48}227}-1}3}4/11/2017}Really easy to miss if you're not looking. Pricey drinks, good sake selection. Place is in a basement, kinda dark and cramped, staff doesn't really speak English for the most part. If you don't get a booth or counter seat, there are fold up tables/chairs.
Thomas F.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}0}-1}1}4/6/2017}Hands down rudest service I have had in Manhattan.  I used to come here regularly and loved the vibe and sake, but not again.My friend and I ordered a small plate and a sake each.  When it became clear that we wouldn't be ordering anything else, they brought is the bill almost immediately, without our asking.  Once we paid, four different staff approached us within 10 minutes to try to get us to leave, including trying to take away our as-yet unfinished drinks.  We had barely been there an hour.  When I pointed out to the server that this was very off-putting, he informed me that they were busy.  Many bars in New York are busy and I have never been rushed out like this before.
Nitzan L.}Manhattan, NY}90}35}21}-1}5}4/4/2017}A place that makes you feel as if you are in Japan...  from a rich sake menu to great (and pretty cheap!) food, the graffiti art and the attentive service. Arrive early! As this spot gets filled up soon!
C. C.}Dallas, TX}54}67}0}-1}5}4/3/2017}Saki bombs!!  Saki bombs!!!  Saki bombs!!!  This is the place for saki bombs!!!Service is terrible.  No idea about the food.  But they sure know how to make a saki bomb!!!
Danica Z.}New York, NY}129}5}0}-1}1}4/1/2017}This place is disgusting. The staff were extremely rude and continuously tried to physically push us out after trying to grab the glasses at least 5 times before we had time to finish our drinks. It used to be a cool spot but never again. Such a disgrace to Japanese sake bars and basic manners. Would give zero stars if I could for sure.
C O.}New York, NY}0}41}5}-1}4}4/1/2017}Fun evening spot for some sake and snacks. Slightly hidden and fun experience.  Almost as if you entered into one of tokyo's tiny streets and alleys with eateries.
Bennett C.}Brooklyn, NY}91}45}0}-1}4}3/31/2017}If you've just feasted around the corner at Yakitori Taisho or Kenka and are seeking a chill place to sip sake with a few friends, look for the little sign leading down to a basement door. Inside is a tiny space rich with gritty ambiance and the most extensive sake menu I've found anywhere in the city.
Adam C.}New York, NY}332}149}40}18}2}3/31/2017}Really sad to post this review as I've gone to this sake bar for over 3 years and keep trying to give myself excuses as to why the service is SO AWFUL but I just can't anymore. The pluses:the vibe is amazing, usually great music , GREAT food and the sake selection is incredible. The service on the other hand, every time I go, is terrible. They either rush the hell out of you asking you over and over again if you want another glass when you have half a glass left, giving you a check out of nowhere or like last night, the guy maning the rope telling me that he won't seat us in the back bar when there are plenty of open seats and then saying ,"there's no seats, understand?!" Five times. Unbelievably rude and uncalled for.Going to think twice about going back at this point
Nelson M.}Santa Fe, NM}1}26}9}-1}5}3/22/2017}Great underground Japanese place! We had some raw tuna, edamame, and vegetable udon, and everything had great flavor to them. Thanks for having us at 1:00am, highly recommended!
Minji C.}Leonia, NJ}1}8}0}-1}3}3/21/2017}I don't mind the tight crowded and LOUD space (it's honestly so loud you can't hold a proper conversation with the person sitting right in front of you). It's fine, it's NYC I get it. Rent is expensive and you need to cram and flip as many tables as you can. But honestly, the food is mediocre and everything is pricey. It's just a hipster attraction in my opinion. Worth a visit if you're into this kind of scene, but I don't really recommend anything off the menu.
Nick C.}Jacksonville Beach, FL}0}79}6}-1}5}3/19/2017}Absolutely Awesome!  Killer soundtrack of 90's hip hop, aesome bar bites, fantastic (and reasonably priced) Sake menu.  TIP:  Come here right when the open at 6:00 - otherwise be prepared to wait.... a long time.
Laura S.}Manhattan, NY}104}266}4}18}4}3/12/2017}I'm a huge fan of Decibel.The decor, albeit grimy, is very original.It's a hidden bar where you need to descend a subtle staircase to enter. Truthfully, I don't think it's a real hidden gem because I think most Japanese loving East Villagers are aware of Decibel.It's pretty small, and the loud music played could be hit or miss. I really appreciate the extensive sake box options, as well as the small bites on the food menu. Wouldn't advise this place for a group gathering but very cool date-place or one on one get-together spot.
Jennifer F.}Manhattan, NY}0}25}0}-1}5}3/11/2017}Amazing hidden spot in East Village. I felt like I had escaped to some other planet. I've never been to a place quite like it. Such a unique experience! The wasabi dumplings & raw octopus were my favorites..and the sake is spectacular. Sometimes it's not about the service but about the experience. This place is definitely that.
Wanlu M.}New York, NY}1}17}12}-1}2}3/7/2017}Two stars gives to 米吉 which is its neighbor. You can order food from 米吉 and eat here as well.
Secil A.}Manhattan, NY}300}138}199}18}4}3/7/2017}It's a hidden gem. You walk down a thin set of stairs to get there. We got a bottle of sake in a table next to the corridor. The service was quick but the music was a little too loud and maybe too edgy for me. It was alternative music and the inside decor was very hip. It was overall a unique, interesting experience, recommend checking out
Krešo M.}Manhattan, NY}11}8}0}-1}5}3/5/2017}Oh God I really liked this place. So authentic and Special. Unfortunately, never been in Japan but this place made me think about it. Amazing service, authentic environment, combined with remarkable Japanese cuisine gives you special and unique experience. Will be definitely coming back many times in the future.
Blake B.}San Francisco, CA}101}1274}3}18}5}3/5/2017}This place is amazing.  Completely hidden and once you're inside it's like you're in another underground world with graffiti everywhere.  The staff was really nice and their variety of sake seemed endless.  I like how they described the various sakes as it made it easier to pick them.Great spot for a unique night out.
Roderick B.}Manhattan, New York, NY}2}3}0}-1}1}2/28/2017}I've been to Decibel many times over the past few years, but this was the first time where I've felt jilted. I came with a group of friends and were seated promptly which was great. We got menus and ordered. Fine still. From the point we received our drinks to the time we left, we were never checked upon. Not really a problem, but, when it was time to pay the bill, I gave less than the 18% tip that was shown as the lowest tip option on the bill. This wasn't stated as a mandatory tip by the way. After paying, one of the staff, had the gall to say the tip was too low. The tip was greater than 10%. We did not order any food whatsoever and each only had one drink. We were seated at a tabletop meant for 4 when we had 6 and we were not even offered a glass of water during the entire time! After we finished our drinks, the table was just cleared up, and we were never asked whether we would like another drink. The service was just so so poor this time around. I can't believe this is the place I used to love. My friend didn't want an argument so gave some more cash in tip. The sake is still good, but I think that will have been my last time ever coming here.
S K.}New York, NY}92}13}0}-1}3}2/22/2017}Very mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, it's a really cool and unique space (really feels like an izakaya in Japan), and there's a wonderful selection of sake. I also have a lot of sentimental value attached to this place, as it was where I went on my second ever date with my boyfriend!The reason I can't give this place 5 stars, though, is the truly baffling service. Strangely, the hosts and servers are all super friendly and welcoming when they greet you and take your order. But their demeanor literally flips like a switch if they're not happy with the tip. This has happened not once, but TWICE I've been there. Each time, we left a what I think is a fair tip for drinks (~15%)--especially considering that after they brought our sake they never came to check on us, fill our water, or anything like that--and each time, we have been asked very rudely why we did not leave more tip. The last time I came here, my boyfriend and I ordered a $38 bottle of sake. We left a $5 tip, which I think is more than enough for the "service" we received. However, our waiter came by and literally GRABBED my boyfriend's shoulder and said, "This is not enough tip, why is it so low?" Not wanting to cause any confrontation, I just gave him another $2 and we got the hell out of there. Felt very uncomfortable though, and put a sour note on what was otherwise a really lovely time there.As this wasn't the first time something like this has happened, I'm feeling less and less compelled to come here. Either be prepared to tip at least 20% here or expect to be treated like dirt.
Nicole D.}Manhattan, New York, NY}614}1}0}-1}5}2/20/2017}Best spot around. Food is cheap and delicious. Kota was the best server and was genuinely happy to have us. Get the noodle salad and beef bowl. The sake selection doesn't hurt either, I'd come just to drink. The music went from punk to electronic to funk. I dig this place so hard. Make the right choice- check it out.
G S.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}23}-1}2}2/16/2017}Food is not prepared well. Very bland. Doesn't taste fresh. Good ambiance. Great place to grab sake. Do not eat the food.
Jessica W.}Walnut Creek, CA}261}139}292}18}2}2/7/2017}Unique, hip ambiance but AWFUL service and pricey menu. Ambiance: I stumbled upon this bar by chance. After eating dinner with friends, we happened to be chatting outside the entrance to this sake bar. We saw some people head into a decoratively graffiti-ed door and decided to spontaneously give this place a try. Expecting a bar setting, we showed our IDs, went over a rope and were seated at a cramped table. The light is very dim, walls are heavily decorated and the people seemed young and hip. We felt very cool for finding this spot. Although it felt like a fire hazard and the air was damp with vaporized sweat, I give the ambiance 4/5. Service: Since we only came to drink, we ordered 2 bottles of sake for 5 people. There is an $8 minimum per person so perhaps they wanted us to spend more. However we met that requirement so it's not an excuse for the curt service. Some of us finished our sake portions before the others and our shot glasses were literally GRABBED OUT OF OUR HANDS! For the remaining slow sippers, the waitress poured our remaining sake into their glasses and took our bottles. Very disappointed since we thought the bottles were cute and wanted to take them home. 0/5I will NOT be coming here again.
Solomon C.}Queens, NY}340}406}93}18}4}2/6/2017}sweet dive bar with a pretty sizeable sake list. normally "dive" and "Japanese" don't really go together but this place works! It's a good use of the space, you can feel tight and boxed in but the staff can still manage to get around and serve you.They also serve Rice burger's here. They're like Whitecastle burger sized but one is enough to hold you over. This isn't really a place for a meal, more of a Tapas kind of thing with their small plates of edamame, Japanese seaweed and such. Don't come here with a big group, I'd say 3 is already pushing it.
Solah H.}New York, NY}39}89}287}18}4}2/5/2017}such a cool place to be! it's in basement so easy to miss it when you are looking for it, but once you go down the stairs it's like a whole new bar in your eyes. very tightly organized, so it is pretty crowded. but very fun and exciting vibes you will enjoy with sakes! didn't get to try any food since i got there right after the dinner, but the dishes on the other tables look really great. oh! i did have edamame. it comes cold but you will enjoy it! :)
Alejandro N.}Manhattan, NY}4}6}0}-1}1}2/5/2017}What a bunch of rude people. My friends and I have come often to this place to enjoy the sake selection and the fun ambience inside. Unfortunately as of lately, the hosts have become super hostile and intransigent, for no logical reason. It happened to us and to people next to us. It's so off-putting that we just don't feel like going there anymore. It's not like it's the only sake bar downtown. I give it one star because, even though the experience can be fun inside, it is completely negated by the rude awakening at the entrance.
Christopher S.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}4}77}57}-1}5}2/4/2017}Such a good find. I stumbled upon this place on a recent trip to manhattan. It's located in the basement and is a little unassuming, but it's spot on. I love this place and will return on my next trip. It's a dark bar with izakaya and a huge selection of sake. I don't know much about sake, but they make it easy for you by adding a comment about the taste or smoothness about each type of sake. This place feels like Japan and probably my favorite spot right now.
Mateo D.}New York, NY}16}22}2}-1}1}2/4/2017}Frequent customer of the place which is great once you get in but I need to sanction it today after a very bad experience with the host on Sat Feb 4, 2017 at 6pm: I will not enter into details but essentially he was extremely rude (with everyone) and unable to have us seated after a 30min wait {and unable to explain why) while we were the first customers in line.
Nat D.}Edgewater, NJ}0}13}0}-1}4}2/2/2017}Decibel is like an underground Tokyo sake bar.  It's a cool place to go on a date or hang with friends.  Sake selection is awesome.  Food and sometimes cleanliness, not so great. But worth a visit!
Noah L.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}1/28/2017}I love the space, the people that work there are awful. They try to treat you poorly to fatten their tip, which historical works. They tried to switch fish on us which was lower quality. It's surprising how low quality the people are there.... After telling them how bad The service was they wanted to drop fight about it. In quite an unpleasant way
Leslie L.}New York, NY}88}164}308}18}4}1/22/2017}Tucked away in the basement of a building, you'll probably miss it if you weren't paying attention.However, once you find yourself downstairs, you'll be immediately hit with pumping music and a ton of people waiting to be seated. Of course, a group of 2 is better than any larger group. You'll be seated quickly.There's a huge menu of sake to try. My friend had the ume sake (it's under Unique). I decided on an umeshu with soda as that was my go to when I was in Japan. The spot reminds me of yokocho in Ebisu where you're just fully crowded, lots of good drinks, food coming in fast. The walls are surrounded with writing and if you actually pay attention to your surroundings, it's quite grungy and dingy in the best way possible.The food was good though not mind blowing. We got the fried fish cakes and okonomokyaki to share. These were smaller bites as we weren't too hungry to begin with. Either way, enjoyed the atmosphere! If you want the hole in the wall the feel with a wide variety of sake to try, stop by and decide for yourself!
Maki S.}ロサンゼルス, CA}59}151}62}-1}4}1/20/2017}Cool atmosphere; it's a very tiny, literary an underground hideout filled with graffiti and stickers on the wall and ceiling. We didn't order much food but their selection of shochu was pretty good.Service was good except for one guy with glasses. He wasn't friendly at all.I would try some foods when I go back to NYC.
Leo C.}Forest Hills, NY}220}304}1491}-1}4}1/17/2017}Laid back kinda spot for some sake. Really extensive menu in regards to sake. Seemingly endless choices from low end to high end. Offered in shots or 500ml/750ml bottles. I dont really understand sake at all, so asked the waitress for reccomendations. They were helpful enough, kinda limited by English. However next time I'll read up a little about sake before coming.Space is really tight, even by city standards. Big people really need to think twice before coming. Food option is really limited which I prefer, few small cold and hot dishes. Wish there wasn't even a menu actually. Just straight up drinking would be nice. Our table had a bottle, 2 cups, and 2 plates which pretty much maxed out the table top surface area. Crowd is a bit smaller than the izakaya places next block down, likely due to limited space and food options. Would reccomend coming here if you're party just wants beer/sake, and skip the longer waits down the block. That said, the wait is still excruciating long here.
Inga C.}New York, NY}276}134}412}18}5}1/6/2017}Authentically Japanese, hole-in-the-wall bars like these are what makes me love New York City! Though, don't try coming with a large group or you're in for a very long wait. The optimal group size is 2 people (15 mins wait), but if you've got four and you're willing to wait 45 mins - 1 hr on weekend nights, it'll probably be well worth it too. Harushika- fruity sparkling cloudy sake. This is the only one I've tried so far and I loved it! We got the smaller bottle and were able to finish it between the two of us. I like cloudy sake for some reason... it tastes more rice-y! The fruity sparkling side of it was there but just light enough as to not overpower the sake taste. The interior made me feel like I was in an alleyway bar in Japan, the atmosphere was just right with a level of din that you could just talk above, and the service was prompt and helpful. I'll be back again and again..
Jacqueline T.}Sausalito, CA}247}265}267}18}4}1/4/2017}I don't think I'm hip enough for this place, ha.  Basically this place is sake bar speakeasy, you go down a staircase, and you walk in to find a rope a bouncer and behind that rope, a small bar (seating like 6 people.)  After the bouncer checks your IDs, he takes you through the back which opens up to a larger room with booths, and more seating.The interior of the place is pretty cool, the lighting in quite dim, there's japanese/english graffiti all over the walls, and everything has this japanese grunge hip feel.  (Did I mention I'm not hip enough?)  I'm not super into sake, but I can appreciate the wide variety of sakes you can try out and their descriptions of each on the menu, as well as delicious sake cocktails.Even though I gave this place 4 stars (mainly for its originality,) I'm not sure I would go back here again because I don't really like sake, and it was pretty humid/the air was gross, and loud (aka definitely don't bring someone here on a first date.)  But It's definitely a cool spot that I'm glad exists in NYC for those hip Sake-loving individuals.
Cynthia Y.}SoHo, Manhattan, NY}250}121}12}-1}4}1/2/2017}The selection of sake is amazing!!! So many to choose from and their food is just as good. Nothing too fancy but definitely better than the ones down on St. Marks. Only complaint I have is the room was so hot it was difficult to feel comfortable and want to stay in the bar... it was seriously way too hot, you're pretty much screwed if you went in wearing a sweater or anything thicker than a t-shirt.Food- Loved the mochi ice cream and umeshu! They actually give you a plum in every glass which is so nice.
Huayan W.}Binghamton, NY}50}1}0}-1}1}12/31/2016}The waiter is not respectful at all. Cheap and suck food. Would never come back again.
Shannon F.}West Village, Manhattan, NY}138}167}23}18}4}12/22/2016}Came here with a friend the other night and it was an awesome little place. You walk down the outside stairs and enter a small room with a bar. You then wait for a seat in the back and they bring you to a bigger room with a bar and tables. We tried two different sakes one light and one creamy and they both were really good. I really enjoyed the decor with graffiti all over the walls.
Jung-In S.}Brooklyn, NY}90}143}369}18}4}12/13/2016}Wandering around East Village on a quick weekend trip to New York, my partner and I stumbled upon this place. At first, we had no idea what it was, but curiosity got the best of us and down the rabbit hole we went. When we stepped inside, we were immediately transported back to Japan and the small, dingy bars we went to there. Extensive and descriptive sake menu, enough bar snacks to keep your drunken munchies satisfied, and just enough authenticity to make you forget your nostalgia for Japan, where everything is better (and if you don't get this, go to Japan already). We only stayed for one drink because it was our last night in the city, but I will definitely be back again one day soon.
Ken L.}Rockville, MD}105}143}106}-1}5}12/6/2016}One of my favorite Japanese dive bars in NYC. The downstairs is dark and cramp but sometimes that's not a bad thing. It's a very intimate setting and I really enjoyed that. I felt like I was in Japan. They have a very good selection of sake and whiskey. Aside from the nasty bathroom everything else was what I would want from a dive bar. Definitely recommend this place.
Wick T.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}14}21}27}-1}1}12/4/2016}All of the food are made by microwave and fast food from supermarkets. It is their kitchen Terrible and disgustingvery rude male waiter
charles g.}Oxnard, CA}438}30}28}-1}1}12/4/2016}Bad customer service! I felt bad leaving a tip below 18% to our waitress but after she left the waiter who assisted us was so rude! He kept pacing our table waiting for us to pay after less than a few minutes of giving us the bill, all while the restaurant was still packed. Even once we paid he kept rushing us to sign and give him a tip. I'm not going to pay the full amount tip after his rude customer service.... then he had the nerve to throw the receipts on the table to clarify the tip. He clearly doesn't understand how to deliver good customer service or that his rude attitude will get him a poor tip. This ruined my experience and the rest of my party's experience. Last year when I came it was amazing but much has changed since then and now I will never come back again and will not recommend this place to anyone
Lindsey S.}New York, NY}311}205}132}18}3}12/2/2016}I'm a big fan of the vibe here. We came right at 6pm and there was already a line forming but were seated as soon as they opened. I tend to get really awful hangovers from sake, so I decided to try the Plum Wine with soda. It wasn't my favorite. My bf ordered one of the hot sakes, which he really enjoyed. We also shared the dried stingray fin. Overall, it was a really dope experience and I'd recommend it to those who love sake.
Alain D.}Brooklyn, NY}186}10}0}-1}4}12/1/2016}Sake was Bomb. The food was great. Try the pancake. I had the beef rice bowl. Almost ordered a second bowl but I'm trying to get a six pack. Wish me luck.
Will K.}New York, NY}93}78}105}18}5}11/27/2016}A man stands outside a poorly lit unmarked stairwell.  He asks for your ID, you comply.  Down the metal staircase you go. You open a nondescript door and behind it you find a short carpeted walkway with a tattered red rope blocking the way. You briefly question the Yelp reviews you've read, but your determination is unwavering.  To your left you see a very tightly packed sake bar, struggling to fit the six patrons sitting there.  Where you stand there's no line and no apparent host.  Then just a quickly as your doubt had set in, someone asks you how many and lets you pass.  Through a narrow hallway you enter a large room teeming with an array of small wooden tables, all of which appear to be occupied.  Tip toeing through the groups you're lead to a candle lit table.  You're given a menu, you look around, you realize you've made the right choice.This has been my experience each time I've visited here.  Weekday, weekend, no matter.  There's never been a wait, but it's always packed.  The sake menu is impressive to say the least and you feel as if you're getting a glimpse of nightlife in Japan.  Whether you're here with friends or a date, it's likely to become a new favorite of yours.
Pulkit A.}Manhattan, NY}195}2}0}-1}1}11/26/2016}Extremely rude waiter and poor service (to the extent of being racist). left a bad taste in everyones mouth. Ruin your evening at your own peril.1. When asking for a table - waiter said "it costs money"2. Asking people to leave when not finished3. When hinted to "speak politely with customers", said "will not be polite"
Ivy T.}Manhattan, NY}0}14}3}-1}4}10/30/2016}Amazing list of sakes. The food was average but it is a great little bar and unique quirky space. Good service, attentive and helpful.
Scott L.}New York, NY}5000}2188}3600}18}5}10/30/2016}Cruising around 9th St and checking out the different asian places on that Street, I saw a flashing red light from a metal box that said ON AIR.  It was perched by a gate door that led down some narrow stairs.Curious if it was someone's apartment or what, I noticed there was a small wood plaque on the building wall, which in small letters read - Sake Bar Decibel.The light flashed, but the sign on the door at the bottom of the stair said "closed".  For operation, not in spirit. I had to come back to check this place out.I have to admit going down the stairs was a little scary.When I entered I wasn't sure if I was in a little lobby.It was a small space, about ten feet by five feet, with stark white walls that had been countlessly tagged in marker.  The place had an earthy ships cabin feel.There was a bar, but a wood wall in front of it with a small bench.  There was a rope that crossed the non bar side of the wood wall, preventing entry into what appeared to be the next room.The staff allowed me to move around and feel the organics on my own, giving it a lovely raw tangibility, with the doorway to another world promising yet stabilising with the thought of chamber, nautical shell.I really didn't understand where I was supposed to sit, but was eventually instructed to sit on the narrow wood bench in front of the bar.  The wood wall behind me cradled me and my ship mates who were eventually squeezed onto the bench with - the sweet Katrina from West Virginia, orange bearded Brandon from Portland who had come out to start his own sake production co in New York, and then Jack, from New Hampshire, who had done a couple days cooking at Momofuko ko and nishi as a shadow type guest. We instantly kind of hit it of like college dorm mates.It was like the bar staff organised it in a stealthy kabuki magic by gently forcing us to sit together. Sake flowed.  The tiny bar was just the basics, with Japanese monster masks above and large sake bottles set up filling the wall to dispense.  There was a microwave to heat up stuff. The staff was young, handsome, humble, gracious and with a sense of humour.  Energy and grace are difficult things to materialise, with a special sort of kindness that makes you feel both special and at home.Home run Decible.  I can hear you. The large menu ranged from small plates to larger rice bowls, with a bargain 5-10$ range. (I had raw octopus for around $7 and steamed scallops, which were overcooked.)  Sapporo and kirin light goes for a reasonable 5, and sakes start around $8 a glass.The drink menu is large too.I can hear you. I like what you're saying.AIR ON(I could be a regularly here, but I felt like I already was.)
Nancy H.}Pompano Beach, FL}206}666}1762}18}4}10/7/2016}Despite the grunge, strong smell of old piss while you're waiting at the door by the bathrooms, and emotionless waitresses, Sake Bar Decibel is a pretty good place if you have the drunchies.Went right at opening and ordered up salmon sashimi, okonomiyaki, fried purple potato, niku udon, chicken meatballs, and polished the meal off with black sesame ice cream. I'd order everything again except the chicken meatballs. The music was repetitive, the waitresses were attentive, and although the entrance smells bad the bathrooms themselves were pretty clean and didn't smell like anything. The writing on the walls, dark lighting, almost gravel like ground make it feel like you're in another time, another place. I didn't get the chance to try any sake, but maybe one day.
Desiree S.}Tracy, CA}0}4}0}-1}5}10/3/2016}This Sake Bar is so hidden and has so many types of Sake it's hard to choose. Luckily the waiter helped by asking us if we like sweet or dry and pointed us in the right direction. I really liked the Sake. The place is tiny but definitely a good place to chill and talk with friends. :)
Jared Z.}Brooklyn, NY}274}32}41}-1}3}10/2/2016}Had sake and edamame here on a busy Saturday night.  Little wait time but noticed others waited quite some time.  This is a cool, hip, dark, down the stairs, crowded, basement feel place.  Staff is friendly, good service, hip place, little pricey but that's St Mark's Place in NYC.  Worth it when going out with friends.  Next time I'll actually have food.
Joel W.}Brooklyn, NY}332}14}0}-1}5}9/27/2016}Basement hideaway with great food and an unending sake list. One of my favorite places in the East Village.
Eileen A.}Manhattan, NY}79}2}0}-1}1}9/23/2016}It's always been good except tonight. I just asked how longer it would take to get a table and he responded with a "10 minutes" rising up the middle finger! That was not funny and very offensive!
Cindy C.}Waltham, MA}59}73}22}-1}3}9/16/2016}This place is not that big. Some nights could have long waits. It's very dark inside. But that gives the place a special atmosphere. Their sake has a good variety. Comparing to Sagakaya, their side dishes are not great. If it wasn't because Sagakaya is closed early on Sunday, we probably wouldn't come anyways. Overall, sake is good comparing to most other sake bars.
Sarita L.}New York, NY}6}90}80}-1}5}9/15/2016}Favorite bar in the east village. It's great for a date, I've gotten a different sake every time and loved each one. It does get busy so getting a table at 10 on a Friday is difficult. The best part about this place is the food. The lotus flower is so delicious and the purple potato fries. I've also had udon noodles. It's the best kept secret to come here late night and munch!
Risa H.}Brooklyn, NY}169}158}210}18}5}9/15/2016}The oldest sake bar in New York..!  This underground grungy bar has a lot of character to it - and lots of sake to choose from!  I came here with a coworker after work one day, and I was in good hands with my coworker's extensive knowledge of sake.  The guy serving us was cool and gave us a generous pour of the three sake's we tried.  We also ordered okonomiyaki - could have had more octopus in it, but it was still pretty good!  I want to come back and try more of their food and sake...so I shall be back soons!
Kunal J.}Manhattan, NY}89}4}0}-1}1}9/8/2016}Fucked up service.. The waiter had no manners.. Made us sit in super cramped space.. When we asked about a larger table he asked us to leave or sit at the same place.. We left within 2 mins.. Don't go to these place.. Nothing special about sake as well.. Stupid place..
Joseph M.}Crown Heights, NY}4}7}0}-1}3}9/7/2016}I like the atmosphere, but as many have mentioned here, pretty crappy service.The two of us bought some food and a bottle, so over $100. After we poured our last glasses from the bottle (we were there about an hour), we were asked if we wanted anything else every couple of minutes. It was a strong hint that it was time to leave so they could get someone else on the table.
Stefany W.}Manhattan, NY}196}181}15}18}4}9/1/2016}Came here last night after dinner for some more drinks and it was recommended by my friend.  This place was definitely the definition of "grungy" which I kind of liked.This place is known for their copious amount of sake which is what we were here for and upon further inspection, we found out that they have a decent list of food as well so I definitely want to try their food next time.We picked two different sakes to try and both were very good.  They came in this glass in a box thing where the waitress overfilled on purpose - I guess it's to show the drink has an excess amount of it (something with the culture, I'm sure).The vibe was nice and it was super packed on a Wed night.  Will definitely be back!
Jeanie C.}Chicago, IL}42}215}3}-1}5}8/31/2016}Think grungy underground Tokyo bar with Murakami- esque intrigue, and you have Sake Bar Decibel. I love this place because it's no frills with good sake and okonomiyaki complete with the dancing bonito flakes. I've come here in groups (around 5 ppl or so) and it wasn't too bad getting a seat.The ambiance in this place makes you feel like the night has endless possibilities.
Elizabeth K.}New York, NY}130}32}5}-1}1}8/19/2016}1) Watched them microwave my food 2) Ordered a specific sake... bartender came up to me 10 minutes later displaying a bottle of sake saying " Do you want to take the rest of this bottle for a 'house' price?" I said sure thinking this would be a good time to try something new and do them a favor of finishing the ass of the bottle. Bottle is poured 1/3 of the shot glass. 3) I was charged half price for a sip of the ass of a bottle. 4) My next order of sake was a mediocre pour. What is it with NYC sake bars? Traditionally, you use the sake box so the shot glass can be overflowed into the sake box, or masu as it is called. Otherwise, what's the point of using a masu? Unfortunately, having traveled to Japan and living in Hawaii I've been tainted to the quality of a real, traditional sake bar. Bye Sake Decibel. You've disappointed your most authentic customer base.
Nishu C.}New Brunswick, NJ}309}122}51}18}5}8/7/2016}The place is super hidden but once you manage to find it it feels like you're in another country. The interior is so grunge and dark. I really liked the interior of this place though it's small. However we went to this place because of the "vegetarians go nuts for this" sadly I think they only had 3 options for us and the portions were SOOO small. So it's just a little annoying because I'm getting trashed with sake but the food portions are small. Over all though it was a enjoyable experience but just remember if you're vegetarian the protons aren't big and you have a limited option.
Chris W.}Manhattan, NY}169}38}0}-1}5}8/4/2016}it has been a while since i have been here, but the place is really good. the wait could be really long at times since the place is really small. they have a wide selection of sake to choose from and good japanese finger food. its a really great place to start or end the night. its really dark in here and really cozy to say the least. it feels like you are sitting on top of each other since the place is so small.
Jacl C.}East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY}0}39}1}-1}5}8/3/2016}Been going for around 20 years.  Screw the new barfood and Sake places ... this place is below ground, plays good music and has great atmosphere.  I wish that I lived next to it.
Aeril X.}Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY}4}50}13}-1}5}7/31/2016}As a sake bar, this place provides incredible delicious authentic Japanese food. My new favorite shinya shyokudo in city~everybody should come here in late Friday and grab a drink. The quality of sake is far better than those Japanese restaurant, and the selection is wide too. Besides, u can come either in pajama or suit or even cosplay clothes and no one will judge u, isn't that wonderful?
妍}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}7/31/2016}The experience is very awful. I don't understand why the girl with short hair keep asking us to check more than 5 times. Obviously there are more than 4 empty desks around, and it is just 10:00pm.  We three girls ordered over 90 dollar's food and drink, why we even couldn't finish it? I always have a good impression towards Japanese,Japanese are always polite,but now? You guys,maybe just that short hair girl totally ruin this. This is absolutely my last time came here. What the hell! 这家店的日本人非常傲慢和不友好，没有吃完就不断催促买单。而且只催促我们这桌中国人。我甚至怀疑他们有针对性，强烈推荐不要来。没必要让他们甩脸色给我们。什么玩意儿。
Yijin Z.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}2}7/31/2016}Very bad experience here, never come here any more, the waiter always ask we to check while I haven't even finished my drink!!!!!
Abigail K.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}20}116}197}-1}5}7/31/2016}This place has been a favorite of mine for a long time. It's perfectly intimate, divey, with an insane sake selection and a entertaining menu. I have never had the food, but IMO opinion its the perfect place for a date or drink. Its fun, cosy, artsy, and the menu's sake descriptions always make for an interesting ordering experience. This is one of my favorite EV bars, tucked away so unassumingly right underneath 9th St.
D R.}New York, NY}188}64}62}-1}5}7/30/2016}Excellent date spot, great sake. No reservations- plan to wait 15-30 min to get seated during weekends.
Andrew E.}Santa Clara, CA}308}5}0}-1}5}7/30/2016}One of the coolest bars I've been too. It had a long wait, but definitely worth the wait. A great selection of sake, hot, cold, and cocktails. Can't wait to go again! The seating isn't plentiful  is great for a small group and/or dates. Dimly lit, chill music, laid back overall. Staff was very nice as well.
Miguel C.}Queens, NY}215}285}86}18}4}7/28/2016}Oh man Decibel. You know you have to come here!Came here with a friend. First thing you'll notice is it's inconspicuous location. Be sure to be on the look out for it; you can easily walk past it multiple times. Had my friend not brought me here, I likely would have never found it. I'm sure you have a better sense of direction and perception though.You walk down to this underground sake bar and notice that it's just one room. One room with the smallest bar ever and the employees are looking at you funny. You say party of two and they lead you under a rope and through a small back corridor you didn't even notice. That wasn't the way to the back, it was the way to the larger room.Now you're in the larger room and you're embraced by a room pregnant with sharpie graffiti. It's on the walls, on the ceiling, and everywhere you can look. You sit down and look at the menu full of sake.The menu is a treat. It contains more sake than you ever thought existed. How do you choose? Well they list their sake much like folks describe themselves on their tinder profiles. Sharp and full bodied. Creamy, thick, with a distinct after taste. Bitter and full of flavor. It's impressive that they can make each sake so distinct.The sake gets to the table and they give, what is in my opinion, the most generous pour of liquor I've ever had. This is good considering it cost $11. That's not much by city prices, so this generous pour seems even more magnanimous than you could have expected.I would encourage anyone visiting Decibel to try several sakes, but can honesty only recommend the Otokoyama. That was my favorite. Chilled, it tasted like a bit of heaven.Stop reading and go here.
Hungryhungry H.}New York, NY}1}6}0}-1}5}7/22/2016}This place is great. Cool basement decor and great ambiance. Waiters are super helpful with information about the different options which really helps as the selection is extensive. Only went for drinks and had some small snacks so can't comment on the food. But I would return in a second for some sake
Kel S.}White Plains, NY}74}8}0}-1}2}7/20/2016}The Sake was delicious. The food was 3.5 stars out of 5. What I didn't like was the fact that we cancelled ordering an entree and because they didn't hear us cancel it in this very loud bar, even though we used our words and our hands to indicate we didn't want it anymore, they decided to charge us for it. We didn't even eat what they brought and told them to take it back. They were very insistent on charging us and not just that but they made us feel bad for it, not sure if it's cause they need the money that badly but I paid and left cause I was getting frustrated. I also took the difference of the entree from the tip. They're lucky I left a tip. I also took the liberty of translating this review to Japanese so that they can at least learn from their mistakes and not give other customers a bad experience. Any nonsensical grammar or punctuation is cause of Google. 酒はおいしかったです。食べ物は私たちが前菜を注文キャンセルという事実だった私は好きではなかった5の3.5つ星だったし、彼らは、私たちは私たちが私たちの言葉と我々の手を使用していても、この非常に大きなバーでそれをキャンセル聞いていないので、我々はそれをもうしたくなかった示し、彼らはそれのために私たちを充電することを決めました。私たちも、彼らが持ってきて、それを取り戻すためにそれらを言った食べていませんでした。彼らは私たちを充電するには非常にしつこいしただけではなく、それが、彼らは私たちが、彼らはひどく、私が支払ったお金と私はイライラした左原因を必要とする原因、それはだかどうかわからない、それのために悪い感じさせてくれました。私はまた、先端から前菜との差を取りました。彼らは私が、先端を左に幸運。私はまた、彼らは少なくとも自分の過ちから学び、他の顧客に悪い経験を与えることができないように、日本にこのレビューを翻訳の自由を取りました。任意の無意味な文法や句読点は、Googleの原因です。
mary p.}San Francisco, CA}0}31}0}-1}5}7/15/2016}This place is and has been always awesome.One of the BEST Sake selections in NYC.That's ALL you need to know!
Nina A.}Washington, DC}0}15}0}-1}5}7/3/2016}A total surprise find and so great.  Authentic Japanese food, with every detail carefully assembled.  Ambiance is dark, red lanterns, graffiti on the walls .... Transports you to another world for a few hours (or however long you stay).
Seb R.}New York, NY}12}55}0}-1}5}6/28/2016}Warm, authentic Japanese ambiance, incredible sake variety. Music perfectly tuned to ambiance. Highly recommend!
Mike H.}New York, NY}154}103}367}18}4}6/28/2016}Decibel is definitely one of the more unique sake bars in the city. From its lantern-lit interior to the rioting graffiti sprawling across its walls, this underground bar is a sanctuary from the mainstream scene above. The inside is divided into two sections. The stairs immediately lead you to the first but smaller bar that seats about half-a-dozen. The main bar area is actually hidden behind this one, connected by a short passageway. Here, the space expands and provides plenty of seating. Decors aside, the menu is eclectic and reminiscent of Japanese sake culture. Fittingly, most dishes are quite small and are meant to be enjoyed as a series of shared bites. My favorite was the tea-soaked rice. It had the consistency of porridge and blended really well the flavors from tea and the toppings. Watch out for the wasabi dumpling: they are delicious but swallowing whole and inhaling the hot steam will not end well - keyword is "wasabi". Finally, we also tried a bottle of their seasonal sweat sake. It was really fragrant and had a strong fruity aroma. Overall, a great place to hang out if you are looking for an unique experience around St Marks.It is easy to miss this place as folks are too drawn to the lights and people traffic around St. Marks. For us, this played to our favor since we were looking for a place that was not obscenely crowded at 11pm on a Saturday night.
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}6/25/2016}My 1000th review! I will be proudly donating this one to the farewell drink for my best friend at work, who will be leaving for work in Japan in the coming week.We came in really late, around 10pm, after a short drink at another Japanese bar. Apparently this one had present a more authentic Japanese bar culture (by showing handwritings on the wall/ceiling) and a variety of small plate selections. We shared a sweet bottle of sake, as well as okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake), salted edamame, warm tofu bowl, green tea rice with salmon, and the wasabi shumai. Portion was just about right to share and flavor even reminded me my time in Tokyo. I suddenly remembered that I had passed this place many times visiting east village and always would like to give a try. Now dream came true.If there was one thing to complain, that will be the fact that they only took four credit cards. Otherwise, if you prefer to enjoy some hearty Japanese dishes at late night and happen to be in this neighborhood, Decibel was a good one that you cannot miss!
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}6/25/2016}Super dope with good divey spot! The entrance is like a time machine that took us to the retro Japan upon entrance. My friends and I went there post midnight after a visit to angles share. Great ambiance, great music! Famous for its sake, sake bar decibel offers pages and pages of sake selection, plus a limited page of food. For sake, please consult the waiters/waitresses. They offer great advices based on your preference for sweetness, smoothness, etc. Food was solid and great for share too although the portion is a bit small. We got green tea cod roe soup rice, tofu, seafood pancake, fried purple sweet potato, and edamame. Everything was delicious! The warm green tea cod roe rice soup is a great comfort to my thirsty mouth and my intoxicated stomach.Very nice spot. Ambiance is also very intimate (Great for dating too!).
Edward W.}New York, NY}357}1236}2160}18}5}6/15/2016}Lovely place that is hidden in plain sight. The decor here is very unique and has a modern Japanese spin to it. We had 8 people seated around a small square table, which was perfect because the atmosphere here was extremely lively, so sitting very close was actually a plus.Started off with some sake shots, which quickly escalated to ordering a huge bottle of sake and rounds of sake bombs. Everyone had a great time and couldn't have been happier!
Marshall F.}New York, NY}0}8}0}-1}4}6/2/2016}Nondescript, dark and intimate, underground sake-centric bar perfect for after-work drinks, weekend sake plunges, and showing your out-of-town friends you know the hip underground spots in the city. Go down the stairs under the "On Air" sign, under the rope in the front room, and into the back room filled with a surprising amount of seats. It is dark, lit by only a few red accent lights, and often a bit warm, but the atmosphere is satisfyingly unpretentious and casually refined, though crowded. Food is primarily appetizers to compliment the extensive sake list which is organized by flavor. You pay a premium for the huge selection, prices are high-ish, but it is easy to spend hours down there and go through a glass or 4. Get the "chilled in box" type where the sake is poured over the top of the glass into a wooden box which provides an exciting second drink at the end of the glass.I've been several times but never on a weekend, which is probably why I've never waited for a table, but a wait would be worth it. Staff is attentive and very friendly in the front room. Afterward go to one of many speakeasies in the area or karaoke on St. Mark's.
Sophia H.}San Francisco, CA}651}476}200}18}4}6/1/2016}This bar is pretty deceiving because when you walk in, it seems empty and TINY. Literally there were only 4 bar seats or something. Turns out, the actual space is downstairs, which was pretty cool. Our group of 8 was squeezed into a small table since the room was pretty packed. The sake here was really good. I'm not sure what we ordered since one of my friends ordered, but I think we got the lightest one. We also ordered a lychee sake. I was surprised since I actually dislike alcohol taste and thought the sake tasted fine. In fact I initially thought the cup with clear liquid in front of me was water since I was busy chatting. After 4 big gulps did I realized that it wasn't water. :POverall, fun place to be if you're looking for sake!
Rachel G.}New York, NY}182}22}0}-1}5}5/27/2016}My current favorite bar.  So fun to get to try all different kinds of sake's.  Get there early, as they will get packed.  The Okonomiyaki is delicious too!  Decibel is too cool and it really feels like you are in Tokyo.
Beck H.}Manhattan, NY}1}6}0}-1}5}5/20/2016}Love love his place. Sweet staff - great service- yummy affordable food and great sake martinis! Cozy, cool..can't say enough great things about this little gem.
Josephine Z.}Queens, NY}722}429}173}18}4}5/19/2016}If you walk too fast, you'll probably miss it because much like its inner decor, it looks like a shady horror movie basement. Nothing but a mere sake bottle icon to mark its entrance. But once inside, this sake bar is a unique experience. The concrete walls lined with graffiti, folding stools, and low ceilings will make you feel like a yakuza drug lord sitting down to sake with your entourage. The law can't find you down here, oh no. Their selection of sake is terrific. I was never a fan of sake, but even a reluctant amateur like me can find something that she likes here. Don't have a large database of sake knowledge? The waiters will gladly recommend something for you based on your taste. Sweet, dry, milky, wheaty--there truly is something for everyone. Perhaps the next best thing this place is useful for? Being a place you can bring your friends to make you seem like a swanky restaurant expert that knows all the hidden underground bars in the city.
Sandra W.}Manhattan, NY}15}21}56}-1}3}5/13/2016}The food is really great but I was annoyed at the fact that they kept trying to get us to leave. I got the seared tuna and the miso soup with rice and salmon roe and both were delicious!
Food L.}Edgewater, NJ}0}6}0}-1}2}5/3/2016}The shrimp dumplings and their sting ray was delicious. The place has this dungeon vibe, dark and gloomy. It's overpriced for tapas and subpar. Pancakes were a huge disappointment.
Jessica C.}Jersey City, NJ}8}10}3}-1}4}5/2/2016}Grimey, dark sake bar. Great service. Packed late nights, but folks are friendly and often start chatting with those around them. Endless sake selection. Not a place for food IMO. Very mediocre in that department.
Shin O.}Manhattan, NY}52}47}13}-1}4}4/22/2016}At first, everyone will be surprised to see crazy graffiti filling all the walls in the restaurant.You can enjoy many kinds of Japanese sake here. Possibly their sake selection is the best in NYC, and not so pricy. Here is definitely my favorite Japanese, so I might take my Japanese friends living in US here. But some dishes as well as cold tofu taste different from Japanese one, so that's why I don't rate them five stars.
Lin C.}New York, NY}581}85}287}-1}5}4/13/2016}I think everyone already know their great selection of sake, but have you tried their food? It's actually VERY good (or maybe I had too much sake)!
Ray M.}Brooklyn, NY}46}5}0}-1}1}4/9/2016}I never leave reviews but I thought I should mention the terrible service a friend and I recorded yesterday. We were a party of two waiting on a third and we were switched from the bar to a small table. We informed our host a third person was joining us we were moved again but the bar didn't have enough seats. Mind you, there are complete booths that are empty but are ONLY available for a table of four (we were told those tables were off limits to us). The waitstaff was completely rude to us during this entire exchange and I was not going to have a friend sit or stand awkwardly as we were trying to enjoy genuine and well crafted sake, which is all we wanted. We decided to close our tab as this establishment did not meet our very basic needs.  We attempted to split the check on two cards only to be told that there is a minimum to split (which is not posted anywhere in the establishment and I suspect was a pure harassment technique). Needless to say, I closed the tab and left this establishment and will not return, as there are several other businesses that will meet my needs.
Alexandra B.}Kirkland, WA}49}35}6}-1}5}4/7/2016}Super unique Izakaya - I loved it. Food was excellent and the atmosphere, while loud, was fun and lively. Cool decor too.
Ya S.}Brooklyn, NY}87}218}429}-1}4}3/22/2016}Very cool and trendy atmosphere. Very hot though, even in the middle of the winter we were sweating our *** off. Good food and an enormous selection of sake.
Shibi M.}Manhattan, NY}283}297}177}-1}2}3/20/2016}ew ew ew i ate the rice burger it was the worst. pork just so cheaply doused in sodium sauce. the rice was so old and it couldnt even hold the food together. and lettuce, why? it just sucked. whatever. deicbal is cool for sake but not for food.
Lu H.}New York, NY}272}526}1859}18}4}3/14/2016}Four of us came here after dinner on a Friday night. The wait was only 5min for us, and we were seated at a small table. Slightly cramped, but I was super excited to they have a very large sake menu. I even found one of my favorite, dassai sake, on the menu. We ordered two bottles of dassai, and some shrimp chips, which were $1 each but for some reason they just went very well with the sake... we were having a great time until they seated 5 people at the two seater table right next to us and I could literally hear every word the guy sitting next to me said. That was the sign it's getting late and crazy people were out. Time for us to go. In summary, great sake, I'd come back when it's not as busy so I can really enjoy the drink and my company.
Tansy W.}New York, NY}25}224}98}18}4}3/7/2016}Good sake. The sake menu is quite overwhelming--it was great that there were tons of choices but I wish the servers were more knowledgeable about the sake and friendly about offering up suggestions. Wait wasn't as terrible as it looked. Walked in on a Saturday night at 9 PM with a party of 3 and got seated in around 20-30 minutes.
Vic Z.}Brooklyn, NY}99}14}1}-1}5}3/2/2016}I love this cozy little joint. It's got a nice dinky bar vibe (loud music, completely dark save for some red accent lights, graffiti and stickers on the walls) with a Japanese veneer (the wooden bar, paper lanterns). They have a sizable menu of sake, liquor, and snacks. My favorite section is the Unusual selection, which is where I found out my love for Hannya Tou, a sweet plum sake infused with chili spices. I don't order anything else.I do see they do generous pours, though-- they fill up a glass until it literally overflows and spills onto the wooden boxy saucer. Maybe that's a Japanese thing-- I don't know, I'm not very cultured.The location's got a downside, though. It's small, so it can get packed pretty easily. The tables are small and can reasonably accommodate 4 people. On busy nights, prepare to wait in line.
Gordon M.}New York, NY}150}204}6}-1}5}2/8/2016}Hidden grungy sake and Japanese whiskey bar underground here. The daku is a nice creamy, cloudy sake.
Natalie V.}Washington, DC}16}226}6}-1}5}1/20/2016}This place was the highlight of a recent dive bar crawl of Alphabet City and the East Village.  Great sake selection, great service, packed like sardines (we were a party of 5 at a table that would have barely seated 2 comfortably), and awesome atmosphere.  The okonomiyaki was not the best that I've had but it hit the spot.  We were pleasantly surprised when the bill arrived and we did not have to sign away our firstborn children.  Would highly recommend, but only if you have a good tolerance for long waits and crowded tables.
Vanessa R.}Brooklyn, NY}1}53}2}-1}5}1/19/2016}I have been going here since 2012, and it's for that secret Japanese gangsta vibe plus the extensive sake menu. I love coming here in the wintertime because it is so fun to descend from the icy street to the warm, dark bar for hot sake and yakitori. This is a great place to spend a couple hours over a bottle of sake and some appetizers with 1-3 other people, though the seating is pretty crowded and not so conducive to comfort for fat-bottomed girls.
Christina P.}Brooklyn, NY}4606}1995}3629}18}5}1/13/2016}I'm pretty much the furthest thing from a barfly but I'd happily make a stop at this place every day. First of all, because I can't get enough of the vibe in there... dark, grungy (but not dirty), with Japanese lanterns and sexy lighting. I feel like I'm on a set for some sort of Japanese film noir scene. Second, and perhaps most importantly, I could probably come in every day and try a different sake each time and be happy most times. There's a loooong list to choose from. Do you prefer Junmai? Honjozo? Ginjo? Daiginjo? Unfiltered? Not sure what any of those words mean? Me neither, but that's how they're split up on the menu and now I feel like a sake connoisseur. You will wait, as you will in pretty much every bar in the area, if you go at a busy time on a Friday or Saturday evening. But don't limit yourself - venture out in the middle of the week and check it out when it's not so crowded. You're in New York City, for goodness sake - get a little wild and drink a little sake!
William K.}San Diego, CA}14}77}0}-1}5}1/8/2016}The highlight of an incredible New Year's Eve, Decibel is the place we wanted to spend the evening. The restaurant is only open in the evenings, with guests invited in by an old, radio "On Air" sign lit outside. We traveled down steep and narrow stairs to the basement bar, where a hostess led us under a hemp rope to a dining area. The dining area is dark--almost entirely lit by two paper lanterns--and intimate. Short banquette booths line basement with small tables with space for two tightly hugging the walls. Sharpie marker and sticker graffiti adorn the walls, windows, and ceiling. The shelves are lined with bottles of sake. With every step into the izakaya tavern, we felt further transported away from New York.Decibel features about the most impressive sake selection that I have seen in a bar its size, though the list also included cocktails, beer, shochu, and traditional plum wine. We split a bottle of sake rather than sample several, and our server was delighted to heat the libation (and reheat as needed). The menu was tapas style, fitting the informal tavern theme. We ordered in phases while cherishing the rice wine, with takowasa (cold octopus in wasabi), edemame shumai (dumplings), and unagi (eel) as particular highlights. We ordered the unagi on three separate occasions, as the steamed fish with tare sauce melted in our mouths.A few warnings for the potentially unadventurous guest, Decibel does not appear handicapped accessible with a narrow and steep staircase leading to an exterior basement door. Sorry Aunt Myrtle. And even with the outside temperatures freezing, it does become incredibly warm in the back, particularly as the den fills up. All said, we will certainly return on our next visit to Little Tokyo.
Irene C.}Long Island City, NY}77}43}121}-1}5}1/6/2016}My best sake- hereMy best party- hereMy best sashimi- herewhat else do you need?)))I used to come here and now when friends come visit me here in NYC from other parts of the world this place is one of the check-points when i show them my lovely city.
Tatyana F.}Falls Church, VA}96}90}5}18}5}1/2/2016}Yes, this place is crowded.  Yes, it's tiny.  Yes, it's noisy.  But it is so, SO WORTH IT!This is the place for all sake connoisseurs and just plain novices.  Don't worry, you won't get wasted it.  The waiters are very pro with matching sake selections with appropriate appetizers.  This is a true New York spot.
Daniella R.}New York, NY}65}21}12}-1}5}12/24/2015}You know when you have friends come in front out of town and they say "Show me cool NYC, where New Yorkers go?" This is exactly the place to impress them with! Sake Bar Decibel is totally the indie movie spot of NYC. It's underground and pretty tiny. Low ceilings. Walls covered in drawings and writing. It's just so cool! If you don't like sake it's no problem you can drink beer or just eat! The staff is friendly and the whole vibe just feels so good. Go go go! Tip: definitely a place to impress a date with.
Mark K.}Boulder, CO}183}11}11}-1}5}12/12/2015}ORDER THE FOOD YOU DRUNK PEASANTS!Seriously the faire here is some of the best I've had outside of that giant-filthy-continent to the east.
Yabp B.}New York, NY}44}9}18}-1}5}12/1/2015}Great place for sake and small plates. No house sake however..otherwise I highly recommend checking this place out with friend or a date.
Elizabeth C.}Brooklyn, NY}311}144}999}18}5}11/30/2015}Super cool spot! Kinda divey but not dirty or rough feeling. I came here recently with a girlfriend around 9 pm on a Wednesday night and it was packed. We got the last two seats at the bar. The seating is definitely cramped over there, especially when you have purses/bookbags and coats, but it's totally fine. The bar has a  front area where I suppose they just prepare drinks and such, and a rope blocking you off from entering the main area on your own. From going down the stairs to an unmarked door and then entering this area, just getting into the bar was a fun and exclusive feeling experience. The main area is a pretty small room, with booths and tables for two. It's loud, but not so loud that you have to shout. The outskirts of the room are dark, but the bar area is well lit. There are cute Japanese decorations on the shelves in the bar, but not much decor other than that. The service is quick and friendly. My friend got a beer and I got the plum wine on ice. The wine was delicious!! Slightly sweet and strong. Prices are fine too. We didn't get food but it smelled really good. I'm definitely in a phase of checking out hidden spots and speakeasy type places around the city, so I loved this place! It was really fun and laid back. I've never had anything like that wine, either. So good!
Binly S.}New Britain, CT}158}47}22}-1}4}11/7/2015}Dope spot! Awesome vibes and Cho is the man! It's underground so prepared to walk down some stairs when you enter. The curry is very good, the snacks are also very good! Went there as a group of 4 and it didn't take us too long to sit. Just about the average wait time. It's tight down there also but it's still a good experience overall. Would definitely go back. The music is great too!
Marta R.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}10/26/2015}Love Love this place!!! I use to live in the are and went there all the time, now I go less often just because its a little far away but its one of the largest sake selections Ive been able to find in the city. Staff is very nice and they know their stuff. The food is also pretty good and is served till quite late.
Alice E.}Brooklyn, NY}482}787}1}-1}5}10/21/2015}This place is old school NY. Dark and cavernous with graffiti on the walls. Untouched since the 1990's when the East Village was still dark and dingy.  I love it here, cheap sake, great snack and superior ambiance.  Great loud music.
Ian J.}New York, NY}40}20}1}-1}5}10/15/2015}A giant sake and shochu selection plus good whiskey. Some nice snacks when you need that. What more can you ask for?The energy in Decibel is lively and rambunctious, it's rare that I go and we don't end up chatting with our neighbors.
Yi F.}Manhattan, NY}78}28}14}-1}3}10/2/2015}No Alchohol experience in this place. Food is ok, the most Impressive one is bought from next door....
John B.}Queens, NY}1}60}16}-1}4}9/20/2015}Its a sake dive bar plain and simple.  Good sake selection at manhattan prices so not much to rave about there.  The food is ok,  not the best but not worst and you can get better eats around the corner.  Why the 1 star because of the service.  2 things happened that showed really bad service on the managers part and the staffs.  I ordered a soju and cranberry and did not like the way it tasted so after 1 sip I sent it back.  When the bill came i noticed that the charge was still on the bill.  I asked the manager if he could remove the charge and he said to me "No fword, I dont know your taste so, You know your taste." So I took the cost of the drink out of the bartenders tip.The bartender and manager followed me out of the restaurant demanding a better tip and cussing about they call the police and waving my $20 dollar tip in my face.I snatched that tip out of the managers hand and yelled "I dont know your taste fword" and walked away and left them as they cussed me on the sidewalk.Its a nice place and would merit 3 stars if not for the horrible service.  I say try it for the experience but be carefull of the staff.I went back here last friday and its like the atmosphere changed.  The service was friendly, the food was great, and the sake was good.  My friends dont know much about sake and the staff was able to help them pick out the best sake for their tastes making for a great and drunken night;-).  We laughed, spilled sake on the table and will definitely be coming back for good times like these.
Fenton B.}New York, NY}0}46}2}-1}5}9/14/2015}I was fairly drunk when I got there, and entirely sloshed when I left. I think I made a pass at their waiter, good on him for tolerating me. Absolutely unparalleled sake selection AND ambience. Probably too loud to have any deep conversations. Will certainly be returning.
Jeremy W.}Irving, TX}43}8}0}-1}2}9/13/2015}Good snacks, good drinks. Too good, which made calculating the tip at the end of the night a challenge. Our bad on that but a total bummer when some arrogant staff demanded that the tip was not good enough. In the end they got way more tip then they deserved.
Joy Christiana W.}Fremont, CA}118}46}16}-1}5}9/8/2015}This spot is right next to a bar I frequented and is a complete GEM!The place itself doesn't have a big sign (or at least I didn't see it), but you will see a lit up sign that says "ON AIR" in red. You've found it! It's underground so watch your steps. You'll first encounter a "lobby" then they will lead you to the back. The back is not too big but enough room, and they require at least 4 people to be seated at a booth. The place definitely has an old Japanese feeling, with the lantern and money cats... It's not overly loud so you don't have to scream to your friends to have a conversation. It is a sake bar, so don't expect other alcohol! The workers are all Japanese too, so if you know Japanese, what a bonus!All in all, I adore this place. Definitely make a visit!
Kevin C.}New York, NY}14}67}85}-1}5}9/5/2015}Awesome speak easy location. I enjoyed my time here, but was a fool to think that this place was only good for it's Sake. We ended up trying both the sparking sake and sochu that they had to offer and it was one of the best/clean ones that I've had in the city.Secondly, try the food. We had Yellow Tail appetizer and it was super fresh, the gyu-don rice bowl with simmered beef on top and then lastly some curry rice to finish it. Recommended for those who are interested in finding somewhere new.
Laura M.}Toronto, Canada}0}56}0}-1}5}8/27/2015}It has the vibe - and in a bar what more do you need?  It is super cute, and super fun.  I will confess to leaving because no where is interesting enough to be worth a line.  But still always try
Julie W.}New York, NY}267}173}208}18}5}8/26/2015}There is neither haute cuisine nor white-glove service here; in fact, you'll get the opposite end of the spectrum sitting next to strangers at the 5-person bar or crammed enough in their back room to eavesdrop on your neighbors' conversations. Yes, this is what you're signing up for. The five stars are for what makes up the experience of being here: its dark and loud ambiance akin to entering a Japanese underground society, their delicious street-style food reminiscent of simpler days, and a plethora of sake to toast victories or drown your sorrows. You have a choice of sitting at the bar or waiting for a table seat in the back. Bartenders were friendly and tried to get us to stay there, but we opted for the latter out of sheer curiosity to unveil what's hidden behind. Portions here encourage sharing - think tapas - and it's probably best to sample the variety. We loved their okonomiyaki and our sake of choice - MU, which had a refreshing hint of fruity sweetness (would recommend this to non-regular sake drinkers). This would be a perfect date place if you don't mind the loudness. I found the atmosphere very intimate and their lantern lighting quite romantic. Not ideal for large groups, though you'll surely feel like you're part of a secret here.
Laurie V.}North Canton, OH}534}1024}543}18}4}8/20/2015}I used to date this guy when I lived in NYC who lived above this place, or around the corner or, across the street or something.....whatever.  He was bald and he had a motorcycle. He always wore this Alice In Chains t-shirt, and he always smelled good- like cedarwood or sandalwood or something like that..... We came here a lot for sake.  I always loved the ambiance.  This was a neighborhood I never really visited very much after that fling ended, but I always enjoyed it and always wanted to make it my home. However, I'm afraid this neighborhood is a lot less gritty now, and a lot more Disneyfied.  It's ok.  It happens. I think I have lived in every single other neighborhood: Chelsea, Financial District, Inwood, East Harlem, Turtle Bay, Morningside Heights....I digress.....but IF you're gonna put a sake bar somewhere, E. 9th St. is the cool place for it.....I miss those memories.
Suki W.}New York, NY}132}28}0}-1}4}8/15/2015}I like that it's a hole in the wall. I went in with 3 of my Japanese friends for a drink after we went dancing. We all ordered our different drinks and we all loved them. I ordered the okonomiyaki and eihire. Both were very tasty! Though the okonomiyaki was small, it wasn't that expensive so I could deal. It came out hot and I enjoyed it.I just really don't like that it's so dark. That's just not for me :/
Ayami n.}Brooklyn, NY}12}30}3}-1}5}8/4/2015}It's really fun here, very casual and cheap. All stuffs are friendly and have good knowledge of sake. Because it's in a basement and so painted everywhere to black, I feel like having drinks in some old shelter. There isn't place like this, absolutely unique.
Masumi S.}San Francisco, CA}0}1}0}-1}1}7/30/2015}Food and drinks are good. I just didn't like like their service after I heard that they said don't come back again to us behind our back.
Tammy L.}Boston, MA}39}162}2}-1}4}7/30/2015}This sake bar came highly recommended so I went with my travel buddy one day. We're both from Boston where there is only one izakaya as of press time, let alone any legit sake bars that aren't affiliated with sushi. We're also not into punk rock, but this is indeed a punk rock bar. That being said, this was a new experience for the both of us. One of the features that I really love is writing on the walls. Every inch is covered and some of the writings are interesting--or they can be after a few drinks--and it's funny how you can see a lot of them despite it being extremely dark inside. Of course the noise level in this place is insane but that's to be expected in a punk rock sake bar, so please don't come here thinking you'll have a heart-to-heart personal conversation with anyone.They have an extensive list of sakes available. Me being me, ordered an umeshu on the rocks instead of choosing a junmai like my travel buddy. We then split an okonomiyaki and unagi. It was okay, nothing memorable. If you want more and better food, feel free to swing around to the izakayas around that area. However, if you're looking for a one-of-a-kind bar to just drink and not talk/listen, this is your place.
Rich T.}St. Augustine, FL}130}248}122}-1}4}7/27/2015}While I was waiting for the surrealism to wear off and Harrison Ford's character from "Blade Runner" to step out of the shadows of this underground bar, I was very entertained by the scene of this Japanese-meets-East Village sake bar. It was very crowded for any place at nearly 2AM as I noted its extensive array of sake and the servers who darted in and out of the shadows. As I didn't know what to order, I asked our server to guide us through the menu and introduce us to what made the venue famous. It was a similar request to Omakase, or the chef's choice. The sake that appeared was exceptional and the sides of seared tuna were very good with our large glasses.In parting from the venue, the manager suggested we return on a quieter night to explore the menu deeply. We agreed with his suggestion as the stairs in front of us appeared to be moving before us as our path into the foggy reality of the East Village would vanish shortly.
Danielle V.}New York, NY}54}38}11}-1}4}7/19/2015}A hidden gem with a seriously cool vibe, I sort of wish I'd gone to Sake Bar Decibel when I was in college. It seems like the kind of magical place that college kids would enjoy. Unmarked aside from a flashing red "On Air" sign, Sake Bar Decibel may be hard to notice. Head down the stars and you're in a small, crowded area where a hostess will place your name on the list. After waiting about ten minutes, my friend and I were ushered inside (the hallway gets cramped - beware). The room is full of small tables that are very close together. The bar is decked out in lots of lights and there's graffiti everywhere. It's really neat. We ordered a bottle of sake based off the name and the price point (the waiter wasn't really sure what to recommend us). As we sat drinking our waiter came over and dropped off a small plate of tuna sashimi with us. We thought it was supposed to go to another able, but apparently it was for us! Kind of a nice little surprise.The volume in the room is very loud, so I wouldn't recommend this place to a first date - but for a catch-up session with a friend or a group of friends, it's a lot of fun!
Claudia C.}Los Angeles, CA}209}209}66}18}4}7/5/2015}This place is so unique and adorable, but it definitely isn't for everyone. It's an underground Japanese sake bar that is loud, fun, and grungy. The first time I came here, I was taken aback at the graffiti walls and grunge-like interior. The second, third, fourth, fifth, etc... (you get the picture) time I've been here, I've started to appreciate its uniqueness and the fact that everyone comes here for a good time and to drink. I personally love coming here both in groups and with just the bf for sake. Don't hesitate to ask the server if you're overwhelmed by all of the sake options. Otherwise, do like me and read the sake descriptions and be surprised!
Elissa W.}New York, NY}319}90}38}-1}5}7/1/2015}I've been here three times and I STILL haven't remembered to bring a writing utensil.Guess I'll just have to go back..As others have said, Decibel is a "punk rock sake bar".  It feels like something out of Bladerunner.  It's dark, loud, crowded, and every inch of wall and ceiling has been written on.  This makes for endless entertainment, because humans are interesting.  You enter Decibel by going down some barely-marked stairs, where you enter the waiting room. This area is quite small. If you're lucky, you'll be led into the back, and the first time you do this is like stepping into another (rather intense) world.The food and drinks are extremely authentic, as far as I can tell.  Which means I don't know what anything is, but that's half the fun.  The sake list is overwhelming.  They're divided into categories, and I recommend trying some from each- I had no idea how much sake can vary! Food is delicious, though pretty pricey and small portions.  When I had dinner here I had to order more then I expected.The space is small and it gets very crowded, especially on weekends.  This is a great place for a date or maybe a couple friends, but definitely not a big group.
Sofia S.}Brooklyn, NY}117}106}194}-1}3}6/28/2015}Came here for date night after the line at upstate was out of control. We didn't really know what the food situation was going to be but it was pretty goodDrinks were delicious. The sake menu was out of control. We didn't even know where to start so we just went for the cocktails. The lychee martini was woooonderfulFood:- tofu was very light and flavorful. The bonito flakesOn top made it look alive- scallops had some outer meat on it which made them look and taste weird but if you took it off they were great- okinomo was great, my favorite dish- salmon burger thing was disgusting. It was pew frozen prepackaged and microwaved to heat up and boy did it taste like itPlace is really small so it's hard to go with a big groupFinal word:Come here for the atmosphere (you'll feel like you're the hippest person in nyc) and the drinks but the food is not worth it
Vlad O.}Concourse, Bronx, NY}1}7}0}-1}5}6/13/2015}Truly unique japanese bar in east village. Feels dirty yet intimate I've been here more times than I can count. Generally drinking Kirin beer and sharing a bottle of Hannya Tou - a surprisingly good spicy plum wine. Lots of sake and takoyak! One of the best bars in east village!
Irina K.}New York, NY}5}1}16}-1}5}5/30/2015}such a good place for sake and sashimi lovers)even with this amazing weather i m ok to go downstairs on basement just to enjoy authentic and real japanese atmosphere right in New York!love love love
Sid M.}New York, NY}6}5}0}-1}4}5/19/2015}Super huge sake list..loved the underground grunge Japanese feel. One of my fav spots on the lower east side
William N.}San Francisco, CA}2}113}1}-1}3}5/10/2015}selections from other reviews"Seating is not comfortablepunk rock sake bar.dark and grungy vibesake list is quite extensive aura of mystery.prices are definitely higher "
Lauren Z.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}4/30/2015}I would give a 0 star if possible...!!!My friend and I had ordered some cocktail and food. When I asked for check, I didn't even look at the receipt and give my discover card to them. Thank god they don't accept discover. While I was changing the card, my friend peeked at the receipt and noticed that they charged double for almost everything we ordered!!! Although they immediately corrected it from $89 to $52, I felt really disappointed. Then I left 15% tip for the wrong charge, guess what happened, they didn't ask me for more tip in front of my face but directly charged 20% to my credit card!!! This is totally unacceptable! Although the environment and food worth 5 star, but the service is totally 0 star. The dishonesty is definitely unacceptable. They tried to cheat because people were usually drunk and would not notice at all. I strongly suggest everyone keep an eye on the charge and tip!!!
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}3}4/25/2015}I've seen this place mentioned so many times before that I finally decided to check it out. I have to say I was not very impressed. The sake list is quite extensive, that's a plus. But the food is average at best. The prices are pretty inexpensive though so I can see this being popular among the college crowd.
Chesha H.}Newark, NJ}43}109}202}-1}5}4/11/2015}You will not be served by a gloved waiter. Seating is not comfortable for parties above 2; barely comfortable at all. You may have to scream across the Itty bitty table for your accompanying party to hear you. The bill creeps up on you due to small plates and unsuspecting prices. You will wait at a length of time only noted in shrugged shoulders.So why 5 stars you may ask? Because this place is awesome. Mirroring an underground Japanese sake den, this place is sold on ambiance. Super dark, super loud, super wonderful.Food was delicious. Hands down. Everything. I'm an adventurous eater. Steamed eel! Edi shumai! Scallops in a brothy broth! White tuna sashimi! Tasty tasty tasty!Sake! Whoohoo! So many brands, flavors, cocktails, strengths. Everything was excellent. I would love to bring my world traveled brother here next time he's inland.
Steph C.}Brooklyn, NY}468}752}318}18}4}4/7/2015}If there is such a thing as an underground sake dive bar, Sake Bar Decibel is it. With some qualifiers. Although the place has a dark and grungy vibe, it is actually nicer than a typical dive bar would be. It almost has an aura of mystery. Also, the prices are definitely higher here. The place is fairly well hidden, I certainly wouldn't have found it on my own. We sat at the bar and grabbed sake. I don't know too much about sake, so I had to defer to suggestions. I tried the yuzu sake, which was quite light and almost too sweet, and another sake that supposedly had notes of strawberries. It was very refreshing and clean. The service was friendly and quick. Nice place to go somewhere different.
Victor H.}Bayside, Queens, NY}135}643}2881}18}4}4/7/2015}Great place to hang out and have both cold and hot sake. I'd prefer the cold sake. The place is lively and its full of young people with lots of energy!
Eddie C.}New York, NY}78}30}189}-1}4}4/3/2015}This is by far the coolest Sake bar in Manhattan. It reminds me of some of the underground bars I visited in Tokyo. They have a nice selection of veggie appetizers that you can munch on while sipping on your cold or hot Sake. They also serve many popular Japanese beers.They get extremely busy on weekends so you may wait a few minutes to be seated but well worth the wait. This is a great place to have some drinks before dinner or simply a cool place to start off your night.
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}3}3/21/2015}The first time I passed by that little "On-Air" sign, my spidey sense for dark, underground spots where People Who Know sup cocktails chortle and toast each other's good fortune for knowing started tingling. No obvious signage, no Health Department grade prominently displayed, only a row of garbage bags lined up neatly - only ever really means one of two things. Opium den or speakeasy. This one's even smaller than the others in the neighborhood, so you may have to wait awhile near the front door area. There's a tiny bar in the front part where you come in, and a larger room with tables and a second bar in the back. Better for smaller groups than a massive birthday party. The menu is crazy extensive: they've got cloudy sakes, "unique" sakes, cocktails if you don't feel like committing to a bottle, and a back list of food prepared in a microwave. I like some carbonation in my drink, so my own bias is the Dessai 50 with a strong sake flavor but tons of bubbles. Like champagne and sake had a child and his name was Delicious. The only thing off about this place was the waiter who came by our table and had a major problem with our doodles on the napkins.  He kept repeating, "These are napkins," indicating that napkins are meant to be cherished and not defaced with our senseless scribbles. Uh. Have you seen the WALLS of this place? Every square inch is covered with some kind of crazy graffiti.  I wouldn't be presumptuous enough to say that my napkin art should be pinned to the wall as some kind of masterpiece that all lower forms of art should aspire to, but it was a weird thing to make such a big deal of.
Mijune C.}New York, NY}43}98}0}-1}4}3/12/2015}Love the look and feel of this sake bar, perfect for having a drink and some small Japanese bar food. It's a bit small and dark but never had to wait much.
Cathy C.}San Diego, CA}113}5}4}-1}5}3/12/2015}subarashi!Sake Bar Decibel is the Japanese style speakeasy in NYC!  definitely a happy spot east of 9th street.you want sake?  in NYC this is one of the places to go to for great selections of sake, sochu, japanese beer and japanese plum wines and bar bites.  go here with friends start the night or end the night - this place rocks!!
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}5}3/3/2015}This place made my night better than yesterday night. MY girlfriend, best friend, and I were walking through Little Tokyo. And then... I looked down into a building like place with a basement. "WTF is this?" I went like crazy downstairs and entered a place that blew my mind away. I was curious, traumatized, confused. "I've walked across this streets for years... YEARS!!! And I never knew this existed!"One of the beautiful things about living in New York it is the mysteries it hold.You can go through all streets, but you'll never get to know the city as well as you think. There's always a new place to see, a new hole to peek in. HA!Well, we waited for 30 minutes or more. Tired, wondering what was inside that space in the wall. Then, we went in and sat down. As I looked around I saw walls filled with posters, interesting decorations, and tons of graffitti. The music was punk, the audience was loud, the menu was vastly filled with sake, shoyu, sakettinis, kamikazes and beers, and appetizers and amazing things.My girlfriend and I ordered a dry sake botle of $60. It got me tipsy as hell. Or was I drunk?Well, the sake was indeed dry, not as strong, and smelled like plums. It was delicate and light as well. Loved it.My friend had his first sakettini. STRONG AS F***!!! I had a sip and I almost died. But it was really good.We spoke, for a while, a long while, we became funny, and tipsy, and happy.Then we left.And I will come back... I WILL COME BACK!!!
Ingrid S.}Brooklyn, NY}756}1218}10062}18}4}2/25/2015}After imbibing in several drinks at the Christmas Yelp event in Harlem my friends harassed me to come downtown and continue my alcoholism into the rest of the night. I am easily persuaded. Sake Bar Decibel had been on my list of places to check out for awhile because their menu of sakes is one of the most impressive in the city. It's also situated down one of my favorite happy hour bar haven neighborhoods. The bar itself was pretty dark and packed for a Saturday night. Elegant and classy. I know nothing about sake really and its not my favorite go to drink so I let my friends order. We went with the cheapest bottle because we put the ass in class. I think it was the Taru and priced in the $30 range. It tasted both oaky and sweet and was definitely enough to tide us over along with a bowl of dried wasabi peas which are freaking phenomenal. They also serve small plates, sashimi, and a variety of deserts for a little bit of a price. Curious if they actually have a happy hour here because I would come back but for only one drink. Also, with the tight space this is really only good for a group of two or three.
Tricia S.}New York, NY}0}21}13}-1}1}2/21/2015}The service was very rude. My Coat was soaked from the bench I was sitting on and window and they said "too bad" when it was 0 degrees out
Thalie L.}Chicago, IL}90}295}310}18}5}2/21/2015}Perfect date in this weird place .... love the sake and food is pretty good. I recommend it!
Shannon W.}Manhattan, NY}58}307}63}18}4}2/20/2015}spot feels like a hidden gem in nyc but nearly anyone who is ANYONE knows about it, so how it maintains that feel is way beyond me. i am absolutely not hating tho. it's got a dope ambiance and soundtrack. graffiti all over the place and the bathroom makes for some excellent selfie snappin. the treat selection is on fleek as the kids are saying these days and there are about 9 billion types of sake to choose from. once again, absolutely not hating.
Latef X.}New York, NY}34}516}549}-1}5}2/14/2015}Amazing drink selection -- literally pages of assorted sakes and shochu. They have cocktails too, but everyone that comes here seems to drink straight sake. They also have good small bites to nibble on while you drink.The atmosphere here is like something out of a Japanese comic book. Very casual and random posters, masks and patron graffiti all over the walls. Super indy looking and cool.Not good for groups at all. Mostly 2 tops, so if you have any more than that, you're gonna be waiting for a long long time. And if you have 3, they'll just smush you into a 2 top -- which could be a good thing if you want to basically be sitting on top of your partner. Don't come here if you're a big person -- unless you want to be super uncomfortable.The staff is really nice here and pretty attentive so long as you're assertive about flagging them down. Can take awhile to flag them down though cuz it's packed busy.
Jason C.}Portland, OR}98}802}1604}18}4}2/10/2015}My friend had wanted to try this place for some time. It usually has a line going out the door, but we were lucky to sneak in during a lull. The indoor decor was pretty cool. We shared a few samples of sake. They had a super impressive sake menu. It's a bit expensive but not out of place for the area. The atmosphere was vibrant, and we had so much cool stuff to look at around us. It is sort of loud inside, but the bar is quite an experience in itself. I would definitely recommend checking it out for a fun start to the night.
Christina C.}Manhattan, NY}3}9}1}-1}4}2/9/2015}Amazing hybrid of Japanese speakeasy & East Village punk cave, with authentic traditional Japanese design elements, raw graffiti, and Japanese art on the walls. Really must be experienced to understand what makes this place so good. The live convergence of the other guests, the incredible range of sakes, music selection, and just-right bar food come together differently but perfectly every time.
Dave F.}Hoboken, NJ}391}573}1259}18}4}1/25/2015}My first instinct was to call this place a hidden gem, but given that it is 600+ reviews, it's hardly hidden. It's a place for people in the know, and easy to walk right by with no clue what lies underground. It's awesome. It's dimly light and not fancy. Sake lists run $50ish a bottle, so it's not cheap, but man, is it cool. Great spot for an adult beverage for sure.
Yumi I.}Brooklyn, NY}497}24}0}-1}5}1/14/2015}The moment I stepped in, I felt like I was transported to Japan. Maybe being a little scared going down the sketchy stairs added to the dramatic effect when I walked in and I felt like I was at one of those tiny but cozy hole in the wall kind of bars tucked somewhere in a quiet alley in Tokyo. But do not be fooled, this place, while it looks tiny, opens up to a whole labyrinth like space and there is plenty of room in the back where people are getting their drinks and conversations on. I'm not a big sake drinker but I love this place. Side notes: They do serve some typical Japanese food, and I do appreciate that they are open late, i believe till 3am.
Chloe G.}New York, NY}96}173}533}-1}3}1/12/2015}If you are looking for Japanese street food this is the place for you . The sitting is in basement which feels like a speakeasy place. Has whole collection authentic Japanese sake. My friend brought me here 'cause he is a fan.
Joi B.}New Orleans, LA}3803}1662}1224}18}5}1/7/2015}One of my all time favorite places in NYC. I love it so much, there's an entire chapter of my (never to be finished) novel set up in here.The writing is on the wall(s) (literally - graffiti everywhere!): Japanese speakeasy. I doubt the existence of a sign. Good for you if you can find it, because as often as I've been here, I still somehow walk past the stairway that leads you down into this secret little lair.The best time to go is late, preferably on a weeknight, as we did. The tiny, dark basement (the floors are barely finished) might have been full when we arrived, but by 12:30 it had cleared out and it was as if we had the entire place to ourselves. I was almost compelled to scribble some bon mots on the wall.Everyone who works here is so nice, so pretty and so chic (Japanese hipsters, though I hesitate to use the "H" word). If you're a bit confused by the page upon page of sakes, just ask your kind server and they will kindly answer you in broken English without making you feel like an idiot. Don't like sake? They have a decent martini list, too. I love all the small plates that feature many items I rarely see in Japanese restaurants (there are some favorites on there, too, don't worry!) There are veg options and there's some udon soups and sushi, too. Go on and get yourself a midnight snack!In a city where it seems like any such tiny "secret gems" barely exist these days (how can they afford to?), Decibel thankfully keeps on keeping on so that you can get a glimpse of what it was like to live in early 90s, pre-Giuliani, creative, fabulous New York where anything can happen. Then you walk outside and everything kind of hits home that things will never be like that again. But it's OK, because you can always return tomorrow.
Paris F.}New York, NY}11}306}186}-1}4}1/4/2015}Def funky dark cozy and awesome waiters.  The bar food is good and the ambiance is cozy.  The bathroom has lots of writing and it sort of represents what It used to be of the east village.  Good drinks and good vibe.
Emmie L.}New York, NY}142}25}67}-1}5}1/2/2015}Tiny little cave in the wall with friendly staff and a huge selection. The grill octopus is the bomb~ love their appetizers. good for a after work drinks~
Amanda I.}Manhattan, NY}652}129}72}-1}4}12/25/2014}Tiny little hole in the wall with friendly staff and a huge selection. My friends and I know next to nothing about sake, and the bartender gave us tons of advice and info when it came to picking out a bottle. The place is literally underground and has this super underground/grungy/East Village vibe. They give you markers so you can add to the graffiti on the walls, which proved a fun activity. The only hiccup of the night was some jerky St. Mark's spillover was causing problems when asked to leave, which apparently, according to the bouncer, is not that uncommon here. All in all though, I'd recommend this place as a casual night starter or after-dinner drinks spot.
Marissa S.}Manhattan, NY}11}220}149}18}4}12/16/2014}Was brought here on a date, and at first was a bit horrified, as it looked like a dirty hole in the wall at first glance.  After sitting for a few minutes, I started thinking that it was a cool place, rather than a graffiti-clad hole in the wall.  All the food I tried was really good - yellowtail, shrimp dumplings (maybe the best I've ever had), beef with udon, and sweet potato tempura.  Not sure I need to go back, but definitely think it's a place worth trying.
tony t.}Bronx, NY}499}130}4}-1}4}12/10/2014}i had a friend from out of town come visit not too long ago and he knew his sake's pretty well. i don't have the refined palette to taste the subtle differences but that's ok. we were waiting on friends and we found this place on yelp and man let me tell you, it was like a little piece of japan's hidden secrets found in new york. we almost walked passed this place since the only signage was this little 6"x6" square of a sake bottle and glass with the on air red light sign was above a stair case leading downstairs. when we walked in it felt like were transported to japan. it had that grungy dive bar feel. the dark lighting, the tags and stickers of patrons who have come and gone.all the staff seemed to speak japanese and they all knew about the sake. and might i add, that list of sake was very extensive. the shared boozy appetizers and food wasn't too big but i feel like this place was meant as a pregame spot or just to grab a drink and chat. the only thing that bothered me was the music that night, it felt like i was watching a child's cartoon show or a very pop-ish anime. other then that, i learned a lot about sake that evening.
Alejandro A.}Montreal, Canada}5}4}1}-1}4}12/8/2014Updatedreview}As always, the sake was excellent and the food delicious. Special mention to the wasabi dumplings and the noodle bowl with beef. But man, the service was not great. They forgot our dumplings and did not explain clearly that the beef sausages came four to a serving so we ended up with eight. And it's, in my view, the least interesting item on the menu. Still,  the service is normally fine so I won't go below 4 stars due to previous experiences, still my favorite Japanese restaurant.
Neill M.}Williamsburg, NY}13}21}3}-1}4}12/5/2014}Our group showed up a little after midnight already inebriated so we were all in good moods before even walking through the doors. We ordered a few Japanese tapas, the highlights being the sashimi and eel along with 2 bottles of sake. I'm not much of a sake connoisseurr so I don't really have any advice on what to order but I can tell you they have the biggest selection of sake I've ever seen (outside of a market). The atmosphere is very divey with a Japanese twist; if you don't like dark places this isn't for you. I don't remember too much about the service but it definitely wasn't bad and by the time we left the 2 bottles of sake did their job of almost completely destroying us.
Norman L.}West Village, Manhattan, NY}3}25}0}-1}4}12/4/2014}I would give Decibel five stars if it weren't for the army of tragically hip servers running the place. Decibel has an unrivaled selection if expensive sake that is offset, price-wise, by affordable and excellent food. It's atmosphere is fantastic (save for the aforementioned hipper-than-thou waitstaff), though much of its seating for two isn't comfortable or appealing. Dark? Check. Graffiti-covered walls and tables? Check. Pretentious servers? Check. A sense of being in a "secret" restaurant? Check. Amazing sake and food? Double and triple check. It's worth it.
Jordan B.}Port Chester, NY}153}9}0}-1}1}11/30/2014}Very hot and cramped inside, and there was a bar tender/waiter wearing a yellow beanie that was incredibly rude trying to hurry our table out the door late on Saturday night. Will not be going back.
Drew C.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}1}11/22/2014}Used to be good...no longer.  One of those ridiculous NYC dining experiences you can only appreciate when they happen to you. Ordered about 7 dishes total.  For the lotus root waiter told us they were probably out.  Waiter brings us the lotus root.  Mushy and basically spoiled.  We tell the waiter its not edible and we can't eat it.  Ordered the Burdock root instead.  Waiter takes away but says we have to pay for it because we ordered it..brings us the replacement Burdock.  Fast forward of course both burdock and lotus on the bill...I tell the waiter we are not paying for the dish we sent back and didn't eat.  Response you need to talk to the manager upfront....Manager: "yes you ordered you have to pay"  Me "it was spoiled and inedible; we are not paying for the dish"  (Mind you this is a $5 or $6 dollar dish on an $80 bill).  Manager:  "You must pay" Me "I don't know what kind of business your running but we are not paying for spoiled food that we sent back".That goes back and forth until we walk out and refuse to pay anything unless they take the lotus off the bill...manager chases me down the block....near physical altercation ensues...  Ends with the manager going back inside and bringing us a new bill on the street.
Grey L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}0}-1}2}11/8/2014}Seriously who would ever eat any food at this place ?!!! Do you people not see how they prepare the food?!! Holly shxx. Their kitchen consist of two microwave ovens and a hot plate for boiling water. Everything was prepacked manufactured food taken straight out of the fridge and throw onto the plate. Even raw fish ( I refuse to call those disgusting pre sliced frozen thawed fish sashimi). It's absolutely disgusting. I stood at the entrance waited for 40 minutes for our table so I have seen them 'cook' every order. Also we waited FOREVER asked two waitresses for our check and they gave us the wrong check then waited another forever for the right check then waited Forever for our cards to be swiped. All these are too bad cause this is really a cool place
Wayne K.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}44}27}59}-1}1}11/5/2014}They had charged me for a higher priced bottle than what was ordered, which I noticed when they brought the check. The waitress was extremely disrespectful, actually throughout the entire stay. I hoped it was an honest mistake but it didn't seem like it, as they tried to trick me to believe it was the correct price. I do know what I am ordering. Nobody cares about anything here, dishonest, miserable staff.. Always check the receipt if you plan on going here.
Twyla Y.}Calgary, Canada}121}266}507}-1}4}11/2/2014}i've been here a couple of times, and always enjoy myself, whether i'm just having tea & a snack, or a couple drinks with some spicy rice crackers. it's tiny, dark, charming, and loud. (one star off because sometimes it's TOO loud. like, not even able to talk to the person across from you loud).service is good. seems like a place that a lot of First Dates happen. Surrounded by first dates.
Leigh C.}Brooklyn, NY}47}212}172}18}5}10/23/2014}Despite the small size, we didn't have to wait for a seat, which I really appreciated. The service was quick and the drinks arrived promptly. I really suggest the edamame dumplings which are delicious. Obviously the tiny, dark setting makes the ambiance super romantic which makes it a great spot for a date.
Victoria M.}Houston, TX}910}564}4175}18}4}9/25/2014}Years ago I visited NY and my cousin took me to a dark and seemingly seedy underground sake bar which turned out to be Decibel. I thought it was quite fantastic and had a great time. Fast forward to 2014, back in NY with a completely new set of people. Met someone else that said he would take us to a nearby sake bar. Lo and behold, back at Decibel! That just goes to show the legitimacy of this place :) This second visit was very different than the first. Last time, there weren't that many people and it was pretty relaxed inside while we noshed on edamame with our sake. This time, it was solidly packed with people, to where we almost didn't make it inside. We were tucked into a small table in the back, and people were squeezing through any possible space to get around in the place. Still sake, still fun!
Sarah X.}Miami, FL}111}114}144}-1}5}9/23/2014}Very underground, great service, really good food, the plum wine was delicious, and my date was super cute :)
Annie C.}Brooklyn, NY}106}145}43}-1}3}9/21/2014}Maybe because I was looking forward to the food more than the alcohol that I was disappointed.  This sake bar is definitely made for people who really like sake because their selection is enormous.  I had the hamachi, edmame, curry rice and a few other dishes and nothing stood out. Curry rice for 9$, portion was  too small. Very cozy & intimate ambiance.
Will T.}Brooklyn, NY}4}34}8}-1}3}9/7/2014}This place tries way too hard to be cool and edgy.The cocktails are watered down and the wait staff is too young to be remotely punk.Hot stuffy pretentious no thanks
Chris F.}Stanford, CA}1}5}1}-1}5}9/4/2014}Came here by accident looking for a regular cocktail bar,  but could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Very intimate atmosphere in a candle lit bar. The place is very authentic tic and the personnel is super friendly. Probably not the best for big groups,  but great for an evening with your girlfriend.
Catherine M.}New York, NY}3}15}0}-1}2}8/25/2014}Place is fine. Sake is great. While they were nice enough to take my iPhone and charge it for me (with my charger), they also helped themselves to my actual Apple charger cable and returned some crappy knockoff instead. So, they lose major cool points for being assholes about that.
Sara W.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}101}187}14}-1}4}8/22/2014}This  place is very interesting as they rope off the entrance if you are waiting for a table.  It's a very cute, swanky spot and I think it'd be great for a date!  I actually came here with a group of 4 and we had a bottle of sake, some beers and some light appetizers.  The food was very good (shumai and zaru udon) and I really liked the sake.  The service was friendly and prompt as well.  Not the cheapest venue, but the sake list is really extensive (and they provide details on flavor which is very helpful) and the environment is quite unique!
Linda I.}Los Angeles, CA}254}302}229}-1}4}8/16/2014}My friend who used to live in Japan turned me onto this place back in 2010 and when I visit NYC, I find myself here with her and a group of friends sharing some convo and a bottle of sake or two.What I love about it is the intimacy of the place.  You head down the stairs and then are led down and around the corner to the bar area by the friendly staff.
Manuela L.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}0}24}1}-1}5}8/15/2014}lovely spot for a sexy dateHad a first date with someone recently, i know nothing about Sake, it was a fantastic experience.  We got a table against the wall, and, wow, it's a very hidden place with a rock'n'roll vibe all dark and sort of dangerous in a non-mainstream sort of way. The sake was delicious, I ended up kissing my date right there in the dark, it was a very memorable night. I didn't pay the bill so i can't speak for prices.
Napassorn S.}Woodside, NY}2}11}0}-1}4}8/15/2014}Love this place and foods.I can't find any negative things here. I could say all foods are delicious.I definitely come back.
Claire F.}Brooklyn, NY}431}672}200}18}5}7/28/2014}Bars fall into two categories: the trendsters who burn bright and then fade, and the naturally awesome at core ones, who stand the test of time. Decibel is the latter. Amazing sake choices. I bet if you knew what you were doing you'd have even better luck than we did, but I get the feeling you kindof can't go wrong with any of the bottles on ice. Menu of bites including edamame and sticky rice balls balance out that amazing sneaking up on you sake effect. Ambiance is everything that's good about a dive bar: super dark, edgy, urban, gritty and striving feel to it. Good for pairs- not odd numbers.
Marcia G.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}4}7/22/2014}Great place to hang out with friends. Excellent variety of sake and awesome nibbles. I highly recommend this place
Ying Z.}San Jose, CA}0}116}15}-1}5}7/17/2014}I give it give for the atmosphere. It is tiny but has a good vibe. It's def a good spot for romantic date~ food is good, service is quick!
Katerina D.}Brooklyn, NY}1}28}2}-1}5}7/15/2014}I am a great fun ever since the first time I stumbled upon this gem of a sake bar....truly amazing.their selection of sake is great.Food is awesome. Their prices are decent for their quality.I love eeeeeeeevery bit of this place. I just hope it was a bit bigger is all.
Jonathan Z.}Manhattan, NY}253}363}0}-1}4}7/9/2014}Punk Music.Huge Sake Selection. Rock & Roll.
Dana W.}Cypress Hills, NY}14}7}2}-1}5}7/6/2014}I actually came here during day light and was a little scared to step in, at first. I waited for my friend to get there and show me the place. It was underground level and the sign said must be 21 with ID to get in. The place was dark and had an old fashion real Japanese feel to it. I had a bottle of takumi and some edemame which were both great. The place became more packed as the evening got later. They have a full menu and lots to drink! I wouldn't suggest this place for a first date but more of a guys hang out place for drinking and socializing. :)
Amy Z.}Manhattan, NY}147}149}2}-1}4}6/30/2014}This deceivingly small bar is hidden away underground next to Cloister Cafe. When you first step inside, you'll think it's only a small bar with a small bench, but inside there are about 10 small tables. There's a wide selection of sake and cocktails. Choosing sake can be difficult, as some of the descriptions are pretty general, so ask the staff for recommendations. The venue can get slightly louder than conversation-inducing level, especially if the place is packed.
Michael W.}New York, NY}724}1012}235}-1}4}6/27/2014}If I had never read about this spot on Yelp, the I would have never had gone to Sake Bar Decibel. Tucked away inconspicuously in the East Village, there is barely a sign. To compound the inconspicuousness of this place, it's underground, making your search for this spot a tad more difficult. Nonetheless, the times that I've been here, I've had an incredibly chill time drinking and hanging out with friends. Sake Bar Decibel isn't what I'd call a "nice" bar. It's kind of grungy, but at the same time it's not Continental-level grungy. When you walk downstairs and enter this underground sake bar, you're instantly transformed into a scene straight out of old school Japan. With the paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling, compounded with the dim lighting and compact seating gives this place a somewhat intimate feel. The times that I've come here, it wasn't overly packed, so we were able to get seated at a table seamlessly, as well as the ability to talk to each other without yelling across the table. As far as their drink menu goes, you can accurately assume that they have a pretty extensive sake list. I went with my usual Otokoyama which is a Daiginjo. Price-wise, it's not incredibly cheap, but the sake isn't over priced either. Whether or not you order a bottle for the table, or just a carafe for yourself, you're not rushed at all because there's no one standing behind you hovering and hoping that you'll get up and leave the bar. Aside from drinks, they also do serve some food here. Our table ended up ordering some tofu dish that I cant remember the name of, but it was pretty damn good. All in all, Sake Bar Decibel is a great escape from the madness of the East Village. You can actually sit down, relax, and hang out with your friends while enjoying some sake. The decor and atmosphere help compound that laid back feel, while at the same time, transforming you as best as it can, to Japan.
JB R.}Brooklyn, NY}71}31}0}-1}5}6/22/2014}THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! I love their sake selections and Japanese beer selections. I love their wasabi dumplings! This is definitely my goto spot when I am in the area!
Mimi T.}New York, NY}286}178}34}-1}4}6/20/2014}Came here with some co-workers after dinner and it was pretty fun! Seeing as it was late Friday night, there was a wait, but it was pretty short. I got an umeshu and it was delicious! Not to mention the fun munchies :) Can't wait to come back here again!
Sara M.}Chicago, IL}150}215}93}18}4}6/14/2014}This place was cool. I walked right past it so keep an eye out, it is down a flight of stairs, like under the bank/apartments. The service was good they have so many sake options it's crazy, I mean it is a sake bar but I was still impressed with the amount of options. It's small and get crowded we went around 830 on Friday and were seated right away, when we left around 930/10 there was a wait. I would definitely go back, it's a little dive looking, bc its in a basement and the walls are covered in writing, but I liked the atmopsher, I think it suited the place. Great date spot.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}5/31/2014}I came here with my bf on a Saturday evening. We got there at around 6:30, and the place was mostly empty. We got:Lychee Martini: I liked this a lot. I generally don't like martinis, but still enjoyed it because of the subtle lychee flavor.Cold Yuzu Sake with Soda: My bf got this drink, and he really enjoyed it. I also tried a sip and it didn't taste very alcoholic. It was still sweet and delicious though.Okonomiyaki: Great! On par with that from Otafuku. My only complaint is that the portion was a bit small.Yaki Onigiri (grilled riceball with miso paste): Also very delicious. It was grilled just to the right level (no burned rice on the surface) and the miso paste on the outside was really tasty. But then again, the portion was on the smaller side.Overall, I really enjoyed my visit here. The food is great, the drinks are unique and delicious, and the venue has a very cool, divey feel to it. I recommend that you come here early (got crowded pretty quickly after we arrived) and eat at least a bit somewhere else before coming (while the food is great, it's pricey and its portion is small).
Mike F.}Queens, NY}63}122}88}18}4}5/26/2014}The place has a lot of personality, and a very extensive sake selection. The staff will happily answer any questions, and give good reccomendations once you tell them what you are looking for.The only thing they could improve on is the organization of the waiting area, as they don't write down names. Be mindful of who was before you when you arrived. The wait can be substantial in the evening (we waited a full hour before being seated).
Chris S.}Pasadena, CA}280}111}164}-1}5}5/23/2014}Really easy to miss and you'd never guess what lies below street level from walking past this place.  Instantly upon walking in you'll notice the huge collection of sake bottles they have at the bar.  Once you walk inside further you'll find a dimly lit and intimate dining area full of tables.  I think the dark ambiance with writing on the walls was great but will admit that it's probably not for everyone.Their sake list is just mind blowing.  I was definitely awestruck while trying to read their list which spanned two full pages.  We finally decided on the Ichi No Kura (Junmai type) and it was definitely not a bad decision.  The bottle was reasonably priced and it was absolutely excellent!  I do wish they had some other premium Japanese beers (like Echigo or Orion) though.Takowasa and the hotate are highly recommended!  The hotate especially was incredible.  The scallops were perfectly steamed and served in a delicious soy sauce based broth.They don't take reservations
Chi-Kit C.}San Jose, CA}66}99}2}-1}5}5/18/2014}Came here for a bottle of sake on a Friday night. Pretty relaxing atmosphere and layout. They have a large selection of sake and my friend is pretty knowledge and helped us order. The wait was about 15 min for a table for 3. I'm pretty sure this isn't a place to go if you have a large group.
Tiffany W.}New York, NY}240}275}145}18}4}5/18/2014}This place was a second stop to a night of bar hopping. It was pretty deceptive when you first enter having never been here before. We arrived around 10pm at the door. You get carded right away. You wait behind a rope that is in front of an entrance to a hall way that leads to the back where the bar is. This place is pretty cool in atmosphere. There aren't that many seats so by the time we left the front entrance area was packed with people waiting to go in. I had gotten the lychee martini - it was strong and you couldn't really taste the lychee. I think there definition of sweet is really sweet since they thought the drinks we ordered were sweet. We tried one of their sakes which was really good. Definitely try sake when going here.
August Y.}Brooklyn, NY}61}51}61}-1}5}5/13/2014}Damn this place is GOOOOD... ITS VERY SMALL so deal with it.. the whole place looks like it fits 30 ppl.. All the dishes I tried were simply amazing Raw Octopus  wow, Scallops  wow, Pork wow, Fatty Salmon wow wow! Japanese pancake wow... wow.. its as good as it gets for sure! HUGE selection of Sake so make sure you know what you are ordering. We didnt have to wait because we got there around 7pm and service was fast.I love how cute it is too. underground and hidden out of tourists eyes (except if they read this)One of the better Restaurants in NYC for sure.. I couldnt stop eating. If you love good food come here.. IF you come during dinner time expect to wait! TIP: Put your whole order in at the same time so you dont have to wait if its busy also order double the Sake you think you want because you will want it to go with all of the food you order.
chase m.}New York, NY}37}115}129}-1}4}5/12/2014}As you walk pass the front bar and into the entrance of the main seating area, it's dingy, dark, grunge, cool, dive-y, snug, dimly lit with low ceilings enclosed by 20 years worth of wall tagging.  Sure the tables wobble, and your elbows touch your neighbors but it's New York city, you get along.  And although it is called "Sake Bar" they also serve liquor (Japanese whiskeys) along with your basic clear liquors (vodka, gin..etc).  To simply sum it up, besides the awesome atmosphere, this place also serves solid drinks & good food at a reasonable price.  If other yelpers and I have not yet convinced you of how bada$$ this place,  it's probably not your kind of place.  Price: $$-$$$Service: friendlyGroups: Although it's ideal to go w/ 3-4 max, there are larger tables to accommodate 6-8 (might be a good idea to call in advance)Would I come back? yes!
Rhandi K.}Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, NY}40}17}17}-1}5}5/3/2014}I absolutely love this place. It's such a great sake dive bar. Don't know if others exist in the city. The place isn't that clean but I expect that it's their persona. The music is chill and the bar area isn't large but nice for a small amount of people just looking to do drinks. The sake selection is great and having gone to a sake restaurant, their prices are definitely reasonable. They over pour your drinks so they are brimming with sake. (Was told this was a cultural thing) Overall, loved the place and will definitely come back again to try more sake.
Maddie R.}Astoria, Queens, NY}2}5}0}-1}5}4/26/2014}Decibel is my go to place for late night eats if I have friends visiting the city. Why? Because you feel pretty darn cool leading your unsuspecting guests down a rickety staircase into a dark, Tokyo basement. I've even taken my parents (at a reasonable hour) and they had a blast. They don't take reservations but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes- just make sure your whole party is present.The menu descriptions are a bit underwhelming but if you know what to order you're golden. The three dishes I have to get every time are:classic Shumai dumplingJapanese pancakeUdon noodle with beefI've tried the salmon and rice dish as well and it's great but I honestly don't see myself straying from the above named 3! Drinks? Lychee martini, please. Also, Sake bottles to the face.
Kerry T.}New York, NY}6}38}1}-1}4}4/21/2014}Nigori sake (unfiltered or cloudy) is my favorite, and the Daku here is delicious.Good selection of yummy bar foods.Staff is wonderfully accommodating, especially since it can be a tight squeeze for a larger group.Cool vibe - although it can be a bit dark and dank, it feels like you're in the Tokyo underground.  Really busy on the weekends so if you're wanting more space, come during the week.
Ju L.}Osaka, Japan}943}905}1235}18}5}4/8/2014}I giggled to myself my first time here: We'd just left a bar with a "quiet-only" policy (yelp.com/biz/burp-castle…), and now we were at a place named "Decibel"! Teehee.Decibel resembles one of my favorite izakayas in Taiwan and has quickly become one of my favorite spots here. There's no obvious entrance, but there is at least one small sign at eye-level, and another that says ON AIR in bright red. Walk down from the steps outside and tunnel through some dark spaces to get to the main room. Inside, it's barely a few hundred square feet, with empty sake bottles on every surface, scribbling all over the walls, and huge canvasses with Japanese painting rolled up into the ceiling. The atmosphere is dark, unstylish, and unpretentious.The food is nice for a snack - especially the okonomiyaki, which is likely microwaved but also warm and full of dashi goodness. I'm not a fan of Japanese curry, but theirs wasn't bad - it actually had flavor and some spice! The "decibel tofu" is a fine substitute for the sad fact that there is no agedashi tofu on the menu. The yakko (cold tofu) is firm but creamy, served with no soy sauce whatsoever. Ask for shichimi.They do have beers and sake cocktails - but obviously those take second seat to the sake! The long sake list is split into categories (nigori, junmai, ginjo, "unique," etc.), with a brief description of each sake, as well as whether it's available hot/cold and in what vessel (flask/box). The mildly spicy Fukuchitose (hot) from the seasonal list was awesome. 5oz flasks/boxes are generally $8-15, with [large] bottles running upwards of $100. Flasks are shareable, but for the box you're just drinking 5oz on your own. The flasks are brought filled to the brim and spilling onto the table. Same thing with the boxes; servers deliberately pour so sake spills over the edge of the glass and into the box. Precision is not a virtue here, and that's part of its charm.Somehow they cram in plenty of booths (reserved for larger parties), small tables, and bar seats inside. Too bad you should expect a wait after 10pm, weekend or weekday! Decibel is one of the more lovable low-key watering holes in the area - definitely worth a visit.
Joseph L.}ASTORIA, NY}24}29}0}-1}4}4/3/2014}Mmmm this was a fun night. I really enjoyed coming to Sake Bar Decibel and drinking some sake. The cloudy sake all looked great, and since I've been to Shirakawago, I decided that I wanted to order a bottle of that. It was very nice.As others attest, it's compact and action-packed, with a modicum of grime. I like it all. I lived in Japan and the food seemed authentic. Their sake selection is great.Probably the coolest thing about Sake Bar Decibel is its overall vibe. It's the kind of place that I'd open if I were in the industry. Someone once said to me that everyone looks good in a club, and at least when I went, stylish, fit young ones were in abundance at Sake Bar Decibel, and I felt cool.I can't fault the establishment for this, but there were some douchey types hanging around. The East Village generally is not as cool as it was in its younger and more vulnerable years - less artistic, and more the feeling that I get whilst hanging out in the cultureless suburbs of my lost youth. Someone should do something about this.I also don't remember any particularly amazing music beaming down (I don't remember much of last night, honestly). It was a Wednesday. Their service was just right, they are genuine and take their time which I like when on a rampage. New Yorkers generally should slow down.Highly recommended.
Noa C.}Somerville, MA}67}82}49}-1}4}4/3/2014}This is your quintessential NYC bar. Hard to find, small, a bit dirty and fantastic. They changed the menu a few years ago for the better. It used to be a big thing, all in Japanese with English translation of the name of the sake. No descriptions or anything. The menu now has types and descriptions of sake. They also have small bites of food.We got a few sakes (the names escape me now), which were served at the perfect temperature and a few of the shumai, which were delightful.If you like sake, this is the place to go!
Paul C.}New York, NY}130}63}6}-1}4}3/25/2014}This place feels like your having a party at your friends dark garage. Add in a HUGE selection of sake, Japanese bar food, and cool decor and this is the frankenbaby that Decibel is.The okonomiyaki was awesomely gooey.The stingray is a must-try. It's like fish jerky and goes really well with the sake.Keep in mind that food portions are small, so this place is light on the stomach, heavy on the liver.
Daniel B.}Manhattan, NY}1}23}1}-1}5}3/21/2014}great spot for a date... but even better for a group of 4-6. wish they had more snacks though!
Kristen K.}Brooklyn, NY}58}23}15}-1}4}3/21/2014}Great drink selection in a fun, dark, and underground vibe. The food is subpar, but they're more meant to compliment the drinks
Danny N.}West Covina, CA}2279}1457}55400}18}4}3/12/2014}Great late night drinking place! It's always packed!
An N.}New York, NY}38}133}28}-1}5}3/9/2014}Obsessed - been here twice, just as happy the second time as the first.Long list of sake offerings (almost too long for an inexperienced drinker like me) but everything I've sampled has been either quite good or at least very interesting on the palate. I've had one cocktail "indigo special" that wasn't particularly special but was a nice refreshing pause between sips of sake....The food is also really good and fresh and compliments the drinks well. I swear the shumai is the best version of its kind. The purple sweet potato fries "fried purple potato" are mouth burning hot when they arrive and so well done, you won't see it coming. The atmosphere of the space feels "authentic" whatever that means, almost like you discovered a hidden gem, although it is by no means a secret place..... Even though you have to go below ground to enter.Gooo hereee
Nick W.}Brooklyn, NY}52}45}10}-1}5}3/7/2014}A dark underground dive bar with a cool intimate atmosphere. I have been here multiple times with a date or just with some friends. Both times we had a great time. Well priced and delicious sake, could be a place for dinner but better for drinks and snacks. Don't expect it to be like every other americanized sushi restaurant in NYC because it's not a sushi place.....like the lady next to me...no they don't have avocado....it's on the menu elsewhere? WHERE?!?Salmon sashimi wasn't great. One sashimi was awesome though, bonito maybe?Japanese Curry (just curry and rice) and Meat bowl are solidPRO TIP - Grab a cocktail at Angel's Share the "speakeasy" down the street before Decibel, only if you go early or on a weeknight though, probably packed on the weekendsUnrelated - My roommate had a second date here to impress a young lady. She waited until the large bottle of sake he ordered had been opened and poured before she informed him she didn't drink sake. Hopefully she was impressed by his livers staminaDecibel is exactly what it wants to and should be 5 stars!
Andrew C.}Toronto, Canada}55}284}478}18}5}2/20/2014}Really great Sake in a cool basement setting.  For anyone who's had bad Sake, it's worth coming here and trying something new (and better).   Things can feel cramped on a weekend evening, though.  The Tate no Kawa is fantastic.  In terms of food, we had the wasabi shumai which was excellent.  Service was attentive and bathrooms were clean.
Kevin P.}Studio City, Los Angeles, CA}289}342}6482}18}4}2/18/2014}If you like sake this is the  place for you. This place has all different kind of sake you want. The place is hidden it has a little sake glass sign on top and stairs that leads down to the bar / little restaurant. The food is basically Japanese tapas. But you're mostly there to drink and have a good time with friends. Great place if you'er sake lover.
Brion R.}New York, NY}324}220}8}-1}5}2/12/2014}"Secret Sake" Ai!.  If you like Sake, you need to come here.  Yeah, it's underground.  Yes its not pretentious.  Yes it's in the East Village.  But there is more here.End your fixation that Japanese food = sushi.  It stops here.  If you've ever been to Japan, you know the locals eat a lot more than sushi --- in fact sushi isn't an everyday dish.  Nestled in the outlying prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka, and Kyoto, there are a number of fairly small, cozy, casual dining cafes.  These are the equivalent of tapas bars in Japan.  Lots of amazing sake and delicately prepared, delicious small dishes.  Decibel recreates this feel and taste so well.What's to love:*Best sake list ever!*The food that's solid: Shrimp dumplings; Japanese pancakes* Unique dish you must try: Dried and broiled stingray is a winner...I've never had it before, but it is unique, a little chewy and has a mellow fish flavor.*It's dark and seductive*Feels authentically Japanese: A one and only decor in NYC*Hidden and points for coolness, but not pretentious*The waitresses are super cute What might be better:*There is usually a wait and the waiting area could be improved*Not many inexpensive Sake bottle options.  But you get what you pay for!*Wait staff is a little more reserved than friendly
Ruth C.}McAllen, TX}223}474}446}18}4}2/9/2014}Great drinks and super cool ambiance! You can ask for markers and leave your artwork on their walls or ceiling.  I loved it!
Kit K.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}0}-1}4}1/27/2014}Fun, dark bar with a great selection of drinks. I also has some dried squid with a mayo sauce that was great, but it's mostly small plates, although I liked quite a few of them I'd recommend  this place for the cocktails.
Eric D.}Williamsburg, NY}11}25}2}-1}3}1/21/2014}I'm not much of. Saki guy so let me start there. It papered there was a grey variety. The staff barely spoke English so you better know your stuff before you go. Also seemed to be n awfully young wannabe crowd. Don't I'll go back unless I need to kill time before eating at sobaya or robataya
James S.}Brooklyn, NY}2}3}0}-1}3}1/19/2014}dark, crowded, loud, long waiting time...but have variety of good sake and service was decent.
Andy C.}Edison, NJ}62}168}495}-1}5}1/17/2014}Dark, underground hip sake bar.  This place is a cool spot to chill and have some drinks while snacking on some edamame and shrimp chips.  It's a little dark in there so don't mix up the already eaten edamame for the ones that have not.  =XWe tried the blowfish fin sake which they light with a flame before serving (the fin is in the sake but you don't drink it).  It was interesting but not sure if I would order again.  They have a menu with small to medium size food items you can order from, and have a large selection of sake.  The place isn't that big, so I wouldn't recommend going with big groups.  The atmosphere and sake is what gives this place 5 stars!
Ken P.}Manhattan, NY}34}110}29}-1}3}1/13/2014}The more I get to know about sake, the more appreciative I become of many specialized sakayas in the city.With that said, I have been to Decibel numerous times and have always been impressed by their sake selection and relatively reasonable prices. I have also always liked the dark, grimy decor akin to the commonplace watering holes in the  back alleys of Shinjuku.The only complaint here is the food... plain and simply not good at all. Maybe the only thing decent was the tako wasa....which I believe they buy it ready made from a store.Get food somewhere else....come here for the sake.
Christine L.}San Francisco, CA}441}559}701}18}5}1/5/2014}Decibel is a really, really cool spot. I dig it a lot because - It's got flava inside. Decor is super cool, it feels very underground (likely because... it is...). The staff looks like they were born to work here - The food and sake are great- I stared a lot at other people while I was here and I can officially say everyone looked like they were having a good time.- The bathroom is clean and there is a separate men's/women's If you are looking for more detail... this is how my night at Decibel went down. To paint the picture, I started drinking at 4pm. And I arrived at Decibel at 1:30am after an evening of beer, more beer, tequila shots, champagne, then more beer. This place is hard to find. I've partied next door at Solas a dozen times and never knew this spot was here. If you're looking at Cloisters (bar with a blue awning), Decibel is to the left. You need to go DOWN the stairs. There is a tiny sign. I accidentally walked into Cloisters and a guy declared his love for me and sang me Spanish opera. Really well. This all went down in a time span of 90 seconds. When I DID find Decibel, and the 9 friends I was meeting there... since we were there late, we were able to easily get a table. It's a very small space. When you first walk in, don't be tricked- there's an entire back area.Someone in our party ordered a 1.8L bottle of REALLY good sake. They bring it in a champagne bucket and pour it out for you (in small 5oz glasses). We drank until the guys started rough housing ... but the staff was nice about. I don't really remember the rest of the evening but food just kept magically appearing. The edamame was salty and delish. The Aji was SO fresh. And the crazy bowl of mushy octopus was legit. Then after one of the guys passed out at the table and the place was going to close shortly (3am)... we ordered another 1.8L of sake. We tried.. and failed.. to drink it- but the staff was nice enough to cap it and give us a doggy bag. So we drank it at Rays pizza till 4am. Solid. I love this place.
Joseph T.}New York, NY}9}6}0}-1}5}1/4/2014}Why visit? Sake and fascinating environment A sake bar to trump them all. This is a great experience from the moment you endeavor to find the bar. It's a bar which is under street level; that takes a little bit of effort to locate. As soon as I made my way down the steps, and opened that door, I found myself enthralled with my surroundings. I love the artwork displayed by the restaurant and even more I love the artwork and writings that they let the patrons put up on the walls. I constantly find myself overwhelmed with the list of sake that they always have. I generally drink the Rihaku sake, but any of the sake that is of the Nigori (濁り酒) variety makes for a wonderful night. This bar is a great place for a date or maybe even a double date, but beyond four people and it's a little bit harder to find a spot. Definitely a great place to stop by one night and have a few drinks.
Lisa T.}Hayward, CA}55}1267}6}18}2}12/31/2013}Came here in the summer and it was sweltering! Like there was no a/c. They have a gazillion choices for sakes, but the one I was recommended wasn't very good. Maybe the experience is better in the winter, because the heat was so unbearable.
Adam J.}New York, NY}51}94}12}-1}4}12/22/2013}Great hidden gem in the east village with amazing list of beer and sake. Perfect spot to chill with a group of friends at night.
Steve L.}Manhattan, NY}37}84}40}-1}4}12/16/2013}I've been here multiple times and am finally writing a review on Yelp! My favorite hole-in the wall sake bar. Incredible selection and yummy appetizers. Normally, its really crowded, especially in the late night. It's a real unique NYC experience.
Tom L.}San Francisco, CA}3}35}1}-1}5}12/2/2013}I went to decibel last night with a few friends.  It was a sunday night and we didn't have to wait. As soon as I walked in i thought THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.  The ambience was great, a little grungey but I was into the graffiti and tattered stickers combined with the real feeling japanese decor.  It felt like it was out of Kill Bill or something.We tried a few types of sake which were all great, and the food was AMAZING.  They have these small plates that are totally worth the 4-7 dollars.I recommend the pickled garlic, the lotus root, and the grilled miso rice balls. The waitresses were all beautiful and spoke a satisfactory level of english.  The two guys in the front room behind the bar were cool and talked to us about the music on our way out when we were asking.  They were playing Tokimonsta and Flying lotus who I know from California.My friend was drinking lychee martinis which were great, I recommended she see if they would make her a martini with the pickled garlic.  They accidentally brought a lychee martini with the garlic in it.  I commented as an aside that that wasn't what she meant.  The waitress must have heard me because she brought another made right for free.Great experience over all, though I could see it being very crowded other nights.  I wouldn't come here with more than 4 people though as the tables can't fit much more and it is some what tight.I will come back next time I am in NY
Mochi N.}Oakland, CA}6}138}5}-1}5}12/2/2013}Get here slightly early to grab a table and skip the wait. If you like underground, hidden gems, this is the place to go. I agree with the "5 stars for the atmosphere, 4 for the food" review. Don't expect to eat dinner here or anything, but sit here for awhile and go through their incredibly long list of sake and shochu. *Make sure you bring your ID! They do card.
Meena N.}Los Angeles, CA}503}779}49}18}4}11/12/2013}Long ass wait. Crowded as fuck. Really cramped spaces. TOTALLY WORTH IT. + music was dope+ambiance was dope+ cocktails were delish+ sake sake sake! + they do accommodate larger groups, but it's better if it's just like 2 or 3 people.
Judy H.}Garland, TX}279}268}5}-1}4}11/5/2013}I'm not usually a big sake drinker, but this place is pretty cool. f you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it entirely as it's pretty hidden and the sign is hard to see. You walk down some stairs and when you finally get past the id check, you walk through another hallway that finally brings you to a dimly lit underground area with wooden seats and random posters/stickers/graffiti on the walls. Look for the LOTR quote on the far left corner.The food wasn't really anything to write about, but the sake we ordered was pretty great and the atmosphere of the place is sweet.
Scott G.}Brooklyn, NY}97}8}0}-1}5}10/16/2013}Great atmosphere. Amazing sake menu. Tasty food, albeit a limited a selection with very small portions. But then again, There aren't many places you can find bonito sashimi, which was fresh and a perfect complement to our giant bottle of ice cold sake. Don't expect a full fledged dinner here, however. This is a true sake bar, and not a restaurant.
S C.}Livingston, NJ}5}30}0}-1}4}10/13/2013}The atmosphere in this scrappy little bar is what makes it my favourite kind of place. Scribbles on the walls, a dark/dingy feel, it's unpretentious and comfortable.  The lights are dim, but not in that, fancy-restaurant-so-it's-got-to-be-dark kind of way.  Not to mention, they've got a really nice sake collection (minus one star because they did not have my absolute favourite) and the zaru soba is solid (I like the chewy noodles more than I liked Cocoron's).  Don't expect the food to be the best you've ever had because it won't.  If you're a sake fan, like me, you're not there for the food.  However, the izakaya style fare will go with your carefully described drink of choice.  Seriously, the sake descriptions could not be more concise & well-written at the same time.The wait staff is helpful and polite.  I have zero complaints about the service.It's just a very down-to-earth bar that specializes in sake.
Steven T.}Arcadia, CA}69}93}149}-1}3}10/13/2013}great selection in sake. not like i could fully appreciate it but you can ask the waiters to find one that may suit your taste. it may be surprising as a first time patron to see the first room, a cramp bar (i was surprised). but they do have rooms in the back for larger groups. good selection on food as well, all prepared by the chef at the bar. really cool scene.
Ethan R.}New York, NY}174}117}74}-1}4}9/24/2013}Talking about hidden, authentic, reliable foreign bars and tapas in New York.  This is it.
Jen L.}PRINCE, NY}10}118}6}-1}5}9/24/2013}Absolutely the best gem hidden by a staircase to the basement of heavenly sake on tap.... There is no way to go wrong with this and the amazing Japanese bar food.... Will be back again and again ;)
Valentina L.}Brooklyn, NY}196}179}81}-1}4}9/11/2013}This is the perfect GET SOME spot. Amazing saki options, good service, candle lit but still quite dark,  and very sexy.
Harrison E.}Simsbury, CT}19}80}6}-1}3}9/3/2013}Small place, waited way too long to get in, pretty sure we were forgotten.Good sake selection, way overpriced but it's NYC so what do you expect.Food was small portions.
Saranya B.}Woodside, Queens, NY}16}21}30}-1}3}8/31/2013}Their food was just ok not better than other Japanese restaurants. Most of ppl ordered sake (of course its sake bar) but im not a big fan of this kind of liquor.
Monish D.}New York, NY}128}47}17}-1}4}8/31/2013}What can I say about Decibel that hasn't been said already? This hidden gem (I literally couldn't find it the first time I went here!) was recommended to me by a friend who lives in the city and is a must visit place for Sake connoisseurs. Even if this is your first time tasting Sake, the lists are very descriptive and the servers are very helpful too, so you can sort out a list of 4-5 different Sake's to taste. I really liked the underground, punk rock, grungy, Yakuza hideout in Tokyo vibe here.I tasted 5 different types of Sake here, from extra dry to some unfiltered one. They have atleast a hundred different types to offer. The bartender also offered up Soju to those who really wanted to get trashed there. This was a post dinner exploration spot for me so I didn't eat here but they doled out a lot of delicious looking dumplings, cold soba, Octopus, shrimp cakes and the like. Will definitely be back here!
Jingqiao H.}Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY}129}147}1883}18}4}8/25/2013}I only tried the sake here, so I can't say anything about the food. But the sake was so good and they have a variety of Sake and Shochu to choose from. The only suggestion is that, maybe next time you go there, bring an extra candle with you because it was way too dark to read the menu :-P
Nycole S.}New York, NY}49}77}0}-1}3}8/25/2013}Tiny and cramped, but if you like sake, this place has an extensive list to try.
Old M.}Franklin Square, NY}41}41}66}-1}3}8/24/2013}When you watch those post apocalyptic movies and the characters walk into some underground bar this would be the place that they walk into. First you walk down some steps to get to the front door as you enter you definitely get the vibe your stepping into someplace different. The lady there asks us how many to which we reply 3. We then follow her threw a doorway which leads to a little hallway and then into the main dining area. This dining area is small so be warned, the tables are close together. We come to our little table and we look threw the drinks menu and while my two friends indulge in some sake or should I say a lot of sake. I decide to go with a beer called Sapporo, if you have never tried please give it a go. As you have your drinks and talk you won't be able to stop looking around at all the graffiti that's all over the walls and ceiling. The lights there are dim so giving it this private affair, even though your right on top of each other. In the end if your out to try something different and want to give sake a try you can't go wrong here.
Scott H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}3}8/14/2013}Very nice atmosphere, a real speakeasy feel with good food and lots and lots of sake. Service is painstakingly slow and depending on the server there is a language barrier and no helpful suggestions. Be careful when the check comes, this place sometimes tacks on extra glasses or even bottles of sake to unsuspecting guests. Keep a record of your drinks and check the bill before blindly paying.
Amara H.}Manhattan, NY}363}14}1}-1}2}8/14/2013}Decibel is well-hidden if you don't know exactly what you're looking for--the red "On-Air" sign at street level is the only tip-off to head down the stairs.Fantastic sake selection (I'm always hunting for a good nigori), food authentic and above average, tasting better after a few drinks. Atmosphere is dim and meant to look a little grungy--they're really into red lighting.But the service was terrible. I rarely notice things like this unless they're WAY above or below par, and this was outrageous. We had a waitress who was rude and took almost an hour to bring us four tiny dishes--and handed over the bill without being asked for it. (I noticed that tables around us with different waiters, however, were being handled in a much friendlier, more competent manner.)For a place that charges $10 on average per glass, I expect better. I was really hoping to like this place, but my experience was so off-putting, it's the last time I'll be going here.
Tanya S.}Manhattan, NY}5}42}0}-1}5}8/11/2013}Great little hidden spot. Went with my husband and a friend and were seated at the bar in the the back. We ordered a fairly expensive (for us) $60 bottle of sake. It was definitely worth it. Best sake I've ever had. Our friend couldn't stop talking about it. The food was also pretty good; though I'd go back for the sake and the funky vibe.
Christine A.}San Francisco, CA}362}280}108}-1}5}8/10/2013}This is my favorite place in Manhattan, or even perhaps in the entire East Coast. Nondescript from the outside, mysterious steps down into a small room that only leads you to a cozy red room full of people drinking sake. Graffiti from past patrons grazing every nook and cranny of the place gives Sake Bar Decibel flavor and a casual feel. Their sake menu is intense....I never know where to start. Always pretty packed, it's a fun place to come with friends or to make friends with the table next to you. I have such good memories here, and more to come.
Jeanette L.}Manhattan, NY}13}258}19}-1}5}8/10/2013}5 stars for the atmosphere, 4 for the food. And probably 5 for the sake.The cold soba was great on a hot night, but not nearly as good as Cocoron's. The raw octopus was sweet, tender and spicy. Seaweed was fresh. The shrimp dumplings had nice chunks of shrimp and came with a nice balanced sauce. Can't remember what else we ate, but I do recall liking it all.We also drank a lot of sake. There's one in particular that stood out for me. It was sweet like syrup and spicy like chili. Just a mouthful of flavor. Good post meal, but probably too much during. Also tried two Japanese whiskeys, and both were great.The wait gets long, so get there early and claim a nook to settle in. I love how no one's rushed to pay and leave. Even with a line of people waiting outside the dining area after we'd long finished our meal, the cordial and welcoming staff never hurried us along like at other popular places. In fact, if I hadn't gotten up to use the restroom, I never would've known there were so many people waiting for a table. The ambiance is stellar. The setting feels like you've unknowingly walked into a scene from a Wong Kar Wai film. Moody, mysterious, and offbeat.
Steven S.}New York, NY}77}353}133}-1}5}8/7/2013}Decibel is a sake bar designed in the "faux American dive" style that is so prevalent in Japan. The local Japanese population could visit actual American dives, but they come to Decibel to be reminded of home where they're more accustomed to bars that merely look trashy as part of their theme. To visit one of these as a non-Japanese is a slightly disconcerting experience in Japan. In New York, it's positively uncanny. You are visiting a Japanese bar in New York that is meant to look like the Japanese idea of what American dive bars look like. The only cure for this migraine-inducing situation is to drink sake (not an American drink, by the way). If you don't feel like dealing with the kitsch of Sakagura, because you're young and stuff, that's why Decibel is here (it's owned by the same people). Sake is not exactly a popular drink with young people in Japan, but it has lately been gaining a following abroad, particularly with myself. I personally consume about 95% of the sake exported from Japan annually. Some of it I consume here. I usually go to Sakaya a block away first to buy a few bottles to take home. But I'm so excited to start drinking, I can't wait. So I stop into Decibel, where the extremely extensive menu ensures I can taste a number of excellent, premium sakes and guarantee I won't have to face the subway ride home in an undesirable state of sobriety. Try anything. You can't go wrong. The seasonal selections are always some of the best sake currently available. Anything that says Ginjo or Daiginjo is exceptional. Anything that says Nama is not to be missed (unpasteurized and best when fresh). Eat the food only if you're really hungry. Also, some of the wait staff are idiots. OK, one of them didn't bring me what I ordered, didn't know anything about the menu, spilled soy sauce on me and didn't apologize, so I think she's an idiot. I'm sure everyone else is fine. But talk slowly and clearly or order in Japanese like I do, because I like to show off to my friends and because Japanese people always seem to do spit takes when they encounter a gaijin who can speak their language, and I find this amusing.Expect a line at the door. Dark. Noisy. Crowded. Expensive. (East VIllage.)
Kimberly L.}San Francisco, CA}766}819}782}18}4}8/3/2013}What the?!  If I could describe decibel in one word:* Cray-mazingSummary of last night:Walked down those sketchy ass stairs and was transformed into a little slice of hidden sake bar heaven.  Was greeted by a man wearing a white dish rag as a du rag.  It was an experience to say the least...tried to sit by the bar and then got yelled at. Waited for about 10 mins.  That's it???  Was expecting a 4 hour wait like Ippudo or something.Sat down on the edge of a table and immediately could not stop staring at the tagged up walls and ceilings etc.  Crap I left my graffiti markers at home.  Maybe next time?Waitress came, asked what to order she said the pancake and sashimi - we also ordered soba noodles and wasabi shu mai.  Yum, yum, yum and spicy!  That wasabi will clear up your sinuses real fast.  She also pointed to a sake and told us that was the best...don't remember the name but it was delish.  It didn't taste too strong but one drink later I was feeling it.Only -1 star because service was slow/non-existent.  Basically had to clear plates to the side, ask for water and wave for attention etc.  However, decibel was an experience I will not forget and I will be back.
Aki N.}San Francisco, CA}167}394}62}-1}5}7/26/2013}My favorite sake back in NYC, the little sister to the expense-account Sakagura in a basement dungeon near St Marks. The tables are tight and small but this place is perfect for small groups anyway. Food is fantastic and they have a great selection of sake and shochu, and of course Japanese beers.
Dave H.}BAYSIDE HILLS, NY}30}17}13}-1}4}7/20/2013}Were walking back and forth trying to find this hidden gem until we realize the address is for an apartment building. O_o "Have i got the wrong address" I look to at the corner of my air and above a creepy staircase going underground is a radiobroadcast "On Air" sign and the decibel bar sign next to it. "That looks scary are you sure this place is not a Yakuza hideout" No man it has a bunch of great reviews on Yelp lets do it. Honestly, this was literally one of the right times to use YOLO.  After entering a 12' x 6' cellar with a bar on your right with authentic Sake hanging on the wall you think this is not gonna fit us. Until the lady leads through a small corridor to a back where an authentic Japanese restaurant hides with tables and a bar area. What a creepy surprise, bring on the excitement of the night. We ordered a bottle of the saanda (might be spelled wrong) Sake and it was sweet and strong just like we wanted. Waiters were all in Kimonos and very kind and attentive. I really enjoyed it and will be going back to try the food and more types of sake. There were over 50 different kinds on the menu.
Yad L.}San Francisco, CA}211}362}450}18}4}7/19/2013}Fun place! Nicely tucked away. They never brought us our change though. When you're that buzzed, you don't mind the 40% tip so much. LOL
Rosa C.}Manhattan, NY}5}4}0}-1}3}7/18/2013}Walked in and the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming stench of stale urine- negative points. The walls, ceiling, and exposed plumbing are covered with scribbles and graffiti. Halfway through the night the customers at the table over stood up and started contributing to the ceiling art. Not exactly my scene, but the underground grunge-y experience was pretty cool. Oh, and the sake was fantastic and their selection is quite impressive!
Jess C.}New York, NY}593}305}582}-1}5}7/13/2013}I can't seem to put into words why I like this place so much. Perhaps it's the elusive entrance or the raw, grungy ambiance. Or the random scribbles on the wall. (Remember that MoMA exhibit?) Or the overwhelmingly extensive sake list (I still get the same two sakes, but I like the possibility of choice). Or how the sake spills over the edge of the glass into the wooden box. Or just the polite, down-to-earth servers.Whatever it is, I love it all.And while their food isn't Michelin-worthy, it's not the worst either. Their soba and curry are decent, especially if you just need some sustenance to go with the drinks.Tip: Mind the chiseled man wearing the extra (extra) small T-shirt checking IDs outside on late nights. Otherwise, look for the wooden canopy next to the greenery and gate. You'll see a blinking "On Air" plaque and a sake bottle sign. Yes, just gingerly walk down those steps and open the door. You won't regret it.
Jason W.}Tampa, FL}1}3}0}-1}5}6/28/2013}Beyond! A designer friend of mine told me about this fab hideaway tucked down a small set of stairs. It all felt so secretive and fabulous...a village lair.
Kate P.}Manhattan, NY}25}11}0}-1}4}6/28/2013}Gritty, east village gem on one of my favorite streets. Hard to find--need to spot the red sign with a sake bottle and the staircase leading below street level. Despite the graffiti on the walls and the dark underground setting, the bathrooms are clean and the service is friendly. Our waitress sat down with us to help us pick a sake based on the price point we were looking to pay and the flavors we liked. We ordered the wasabi dumplings with pork and the shrimp dumplings--both excellent! We arrived around 7 p.m. on a Thursday in the summer and we were seated right away. It began to fill up within the following two hours. I'd like to go back for late-night drinks and see what it's like.
Adrian P.}Miami, FL}48}56}6}-1}4}6/25/2013}Went to NYC again and had to stop here, AGAIN. Real NY underground bar vibe type of place.They don't really do hot saki, my fave, and gave me a face when I asked. Tried to convince me not to. For this u loose the one star from perfection. If u live in NY and its cold outside, u ain't looking for cold saki, get with it
Karl K.}San Francisco, CA}0}240}16}-1}4}6/23/2013}Seems like a cool place, but I didn't know enough about sake to really enjoy it to the max.
Shintaro H.}Manhattan, NY}220}106}40}-1}4}6/16/2013}Weird vibe. Tranny hostess. Dark and punk rockish. Not my usual type of spot. But food was delicious. Had lots of sake. I had a great time.
Kate L.}Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY}127}48}3}-1}4}6/14/2013}Great place to hang out with a few friends. Came here on a Sunday night (i know, weird) I like their food actually, its very authentic. Kinda pricey though...
Michelle S.}New York, NY}25}17}3}-1}4}6/2/2013}Decided to go here for my birthday celebration. After reading a few early reviews, I accepted the fact that my party of 10 would need to show up early (as they do not take reservations). Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I came in with part of my party at 7:30, was seated and waited for the others to arrive- once they did, we were moved to a large table which easily accommodated all of us! AND this is on a SATURDAY night!Ordered plenty of Sake, still want to go back and get more of the insanely extensive menu. Others ordered beers, and the majority of us ordered food from there menu. The beef Udon was a popular favorite at the table.One thing to note, they do not do Sake Bombs, so don't ask-Atmosphere was dark, low volume, and intimate for friends to carry on decent conversation. I would highly recommend trying this place- you really can't go wrong here!
April Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}198}0}-1}1}6/2/2013}This happened maybe a year ago, but I forgot to write the review.  Sake was relatively good and so were the snacks.  My friends and I paid with credit cards and in order to split correctly, told them what amounts to put on each card. On our way out, my arm was violently grabbed and I was prevented from leaving.  Apparently the waitress didn't understand what happened and thought we didn't tip at all.  We left about a 25% tip for a not unsubstantial bill since 4 of us had ~2 drinks each and we also had snacks. We were also only there for about an hour and a half at like 5 in the afternoon, so it wasn't busy.  Had to show her the math. She didn't even apologize.
Vivian J.}Washington, DC}222}165}3}-1}5}5/26/2013}This is the kind of place you want to take a date to impress them. It has a cool underground vibe, it shows taste, class, and street cred all at once, and it's intimate. We came here at the tail end of an impromptu bar hop where we started at a tapas bar, ended up at a (supposedly) haunted bar for Jameson shots, moved on to a sports bar for a hockey game, and then ended up here for at a sake bar. I can't remember what sake we ended up ordering, but it was an interesting way to try to educate yourself on various types of sake and to learn how to discern among them. It's dark inside and each booth feels like its own little section of the bar, so it's great for late night conversation.
Amy A.}Portland, OR}24}122}38}-1}4}5/25/2013}A haiku for this underground joint (it is literally under the ground, not like it's fuck-Major-labels-indie-cred underground):don't know anythingabout sake but i like to get drunk woohoo
Linda W.}San Francisco, CA}34}59}34}-1}4}5/14/2013}This place is so cool, I had to instagram it so my friends would know how cool I was.  That's saying something, but it shouldn't because seriously, this place is cool.  Their sake selection is pretty bomb, perfect place to get a bottle or two of good sake to share between friends. I wasn't hungry so I couldn't order the food but a place as cool looking as this MUST have good food right? AHHH... I've gotta come back here and then I'll update, but obviously I'm dying to come back.
Wilson T.}San Francisco, CA}304}443}32}-1}4}5/13/2013}Definitely a hipster underground place. It's hard to find the spot if you have never been. I was literally standing on top of it!Had a few different things.Lots of different choices of sake but I had one bottle that was $20. Fruity and lots of flavor. The stingray fin tastes like dried squid but better! The pork was really well done as well. We also had some special Sapporo but I actually prefer the original ones!The atmosphere is really dark and "shady" but it's a chill vibe with some hip-hop music.
Veronique M.}Manhattan, NY}36}121}0}-1}5}5/4/2013}a fantastic sake bar, with a large selection. They also make delicious small plates of Japanese bar food. It is easy to drink a lot here and to leave feeling utterly euphoric. Highly recommended.
Kristen P.}Astoria, Queens, NY}1}10}0}-1}4}4/26/2013}Love the underground grunge atmosphere. Awesome sake selection!
Carol H.}Boerum Hill, NY}232}245}60}-1}2}4/21/2013}Initially when you walk in, there's bar right by the front. And there's the men and women bathrooms 3 feet directly across the bar. Not exactly pleasant. It seemed really dingy and grimey. But when you walk past the bar, there's additional space towards the back where the main area is. It's so dark here. Only lights is one candle at the table, two large Asian lanterns at the bar, and the light from the sake cooler.It's a basement and it's blatantly obvious. There are pipes running across the ceiling that they don't bother to cover up. Graffiti decorates the wall - and not even cute, intentional graffiti. It looked like actual graffiti. Maybe they were trying to go for the grunge-y feel. That missed the mark.I got the niku udon (beef udon), which was really good. But since the place was so dark, I really couldn't see what I was taking a bite of. Tried the sake but I'm not a sake drinker at all so can't really comment to the quality/taste of it.Receiving the check took 30 mins. First time the check came, it didn't include gratuity for our party of 6. After we paid, they took the check back (didn't take our money) and came up with a second check - this time including gratuity.
Michael S.}New York, NY}6}65}23}-1}4}4/19/2013}Simply put, you come here for the atmosphere and the alcohol.  They have a huge selection of sake and a few Japanese beers.  The lychee martini is delicious and there are a few other mixed drinks that they make.I have eaten the food.  Wakame is a typical seaweed salad that you can get at any sushi joint.  Sesame seeds are on it and it's tasty.  I can never distinguish any difference between seaweed salads from one restaurant to the other.Hotate was the best thing I've tried here.  It was 3 or 4 scallops in a light sauce.  The sauce tasted like it may have been a blend of soy and sake.  The scallops weren't like any I've had before.  In the middle was what I'm used to eating as a scallop but there was apparently an attachment around it (that most places remove?).  The outer portion tasted more like a clam and had a tougher clam-like texture.  It was good though.Atarime is dried squid.  It is dry and isn't winning any beauty contests but it is tasty.  It looks like dried squid, which kinda looks like dried worms or insects, I guess.  It's a nice snack meaning that it is not served warm or cold but room temperature.  For me, tasted shrimp-like and I like they way they soften up after a few seconds in your mouth.Potato salad.  Don't look at me.  I didn't want to get this but the person I was with wanted it.  I gently said 'You sure?  It's a mayo-based potato salad similar to the American one?'.  She got it anyway.  It was potato salad.  The potatoes were even a little underdone in my opinion.  They put some dried seaweed on top for presentation.Ebi shumai is shrimp dumplings.  There were three of them.  They were average shrimp dumplings.  So I come here because I love being at this place.  It feels cool.  I feel like I'm not in NYC, maybe my idea of what some cyber-punk Japanese bar is like (never been to Japan) and that translates into feeling like I'm on vacation.The food I had was ok.  Like 2 or 3 stars.  I don't even think they're trying for anything more than that in the food department.The atmosphere is a 5 for me.
Robert K.}Newark, DE}17}43}0}-1}4}4/11/2013}This is a great place to drink sake and eat traditional Japanese snacks.  All of the sakes I've tried here are grades above what is available in most parts of the U.S.
Colin G.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}4/8/2013}Authentic amazing Japanese sake bar.  Delish, authentic apps,  large sake selections,  dim lighting, kinda sketchy but in an awesome way.  Straight outta downtown tokyo
Christina L.}New York, NY}50}50}0}-1}5}4/6/2013}Sake night go-to. A bunch of unforgettable memories with friends have been had here in this small, dark hole-in-the-wall.
William P.}Elmhurst, NY}100}107}49}-1}4}4/2/2013}I hadn't been to this bar in years until a friend took me here the other day. This place is really awesome, the perfect spot for some sake after dark. Blink and you'll miss it, as there is no sign, and its in the basement of a building on 9th street. Once inside you'll really feel like your in a true NY bar. Graffiti covers the wall from floor to ceiling, don't be shy if you want to break out your Molotow 420PP Mini Paint Marker and represent. Definitely more names on the wall then four years prior. Beyond the graf, you have traditional Japanese decor. It makes for a nice East meats West, Tokyo|NY Mash up. I've never had the food but have sampled the many of the sake and shochus on offer. The beverage list is extensive. When I went the other day we had an unfiltered sake, which I haven't had before. I liked it, unfiltered means that they don't filter out the rice, so you get bits of rice in your glass. good for a date or just kicking back with old friends.
Alli H.}New York, NY}173}595}53}-1}3}3/30/2013}Apparently, you always walk into Sake bars and spend more than you thought you were going to. This happened here.The food was interesting.THEY HAVE SPARKLING SAKE!!I was pissed because I got drunk and lost my favorite umbrella there (I don't lose things, I'm not sure where it went).The staff was really nice, but I did feel rushed when I first walked in, early, even thought after I got behind the curtain, there were two other people in the bar.I will come back; it was fun.
Linda L.}Alameda, CA}29}37}15}-1}5}3/28/2013}Chelsea Handler sighting!! Sake Bar Decibel is the place to go for low-key date night by candle-light with girlfriends or your S.O.  The inconspicuous entrance leads you downstairs to a dark cozy room filled with drinks, good-eats, and medium-loud chatter. There is a very extensive sake/shochu list along with cocktails made with the like.  Shochu is interesting because it's harder to come by at Japanese bars and restaurants. Try ordering a cask-aged barley schochu if you are a fan of single-malt whiskies, and you will be pleasantly surprised!! If you're into lighter drinks, the aloe shochu cocktail is highly recommended.
Ashley F.}New York, NY}0}14}0}-1}3}3/14/2013}Ok so I've been boning up on my sake knowledge and so Decibel is the place you'd want to go to test out your tasting skills, right?  Well, I can say they have a great selection and reasonable prices, but what I would love to see here is someone I can speak to about sake.  To call yourself a sake bar but then not be able to steer me in the direction of the right sake for the mood/occasion/food pairing seems a glaring  shortcoming in my eyes.  The descriptions on the menu of the different sake are only 3 words long and seems like the word smooth, light, and floral are used for just too many of the sake.  I wish they'd invest more in their sake education and then this place could really become a place to call home. A fun place, no doubt, and I will be back for sure.
Jenny L.}Manhattan, NY}16}17}1}-1}4}3/13/2013}I love the ambience here. It feels exclusive because Decibel has a small front area where you wait (and can't see any of the seating). Once they take you back, it's a beautifully structured, graffiti covered cellar.They don't accept reservations, so there's usually a wait around dinner time. Decibel has late hours though, so it's great for late night food too (if you're down to sit). It's a bit pricey, but the food is well worth it. Be careful with the sake because it adds up! And know which sake you want otherwise they recommend a moderately expensive one.Good for dates or to grab a bite with a few friends.The Niku Udon is delicious!!
Ona S.}New Orleans, LA}6}11}4}-1}5}3/9/2013}This place is so much fun!  Great night with friends or a romantic night with your significant other!  The sakis are amazing but the lychee martini is out of this world!  Go here for a fun unique spot!
Marty E.}Brooklyn, NY}132}24}0}-1}4}3/6/2013}If you want to visit an underground sake bar, with a huge selection, and tons of character, you want to come here. It's gotten more and more popular/touristy in recent years, but that doesn't hinder your own ability to have your own good time with your own crowd here.This is definitely a place to take your out-of-town friends out for drinks!
Jason W.}Brooklyn, NY}8}27}6}-1}3}3/1/2013}This place used to be a destination spot 10 years or so ago. It Now has become very touristy. Still a good Sake/Nihonshu bar though, I pop in every once in a blue moon.
Strwberi N.}Manhattan, NY}4}80}19}-1}4}2/12/2013}this place is unique for sure. and there is a large variety of sake, and the food (i only got the edamame) seems legit.. however, the writings on the walls creep me out a bit. too much dinge for my liking. however, after drinking 300ML of sake, you would soon forget about the dirty walls and get into your own zone. will consider going back. with multiple layers of clothing.sake wise - we got the "clean and crips" one :)
Yo L.}MIDDLE VLG, NY}225}60}3}-1}4}1/31/2013}On air!  Played off as a speakeasy but just a regular old graffiti bar w sake like prices once u pass the ropes.  how to drink out of a square bowl?
Brandon S.}Manhattan, NY}4}60}10}-1}4}1/30/2013}Pretty slick spot when you're in the hood.  I don't LOVE sake, (actually i kind of despise it), which is why I even like this place so much.  For a sake place, I really like it that I can hang out there since its so cool.  Took a while to get the bill, but the back bar is pretty hip.  Check it out for sure.  $5 beers.  $10buck decent sake (so I'm told)
Cole O.}Atlanta, GA}207}406}26}-1}5}1/24/2013}Sake Bar Decibel is one of the best night spots I've been to in my time here in this magical city.As you must get there early, we strolled down that flight of stairs around 8:30pm on a Thursday night and proceeded to step into a dark Tokyo dungeon full of graffiti and tables full of hip looking people and bottles of Sake.The menu is aggressive to say the least - there are bottles ranging from filtered to nigori and from $20 to $200.Literally, this place is so unique. If you take someone here who hasn't been yet, you'll immediately get street cred - remember, get there early, it fills up because of how legit a watering hole is.Think alternative Tokyo or underground Kobe - Sake Bar Decibel gets it done.
Michael C.}Manhattan, NY}74}926}236}18}4}1/14/2013}Intimate place to grab drinks after or before dinner in the St. Marks area. Hidden underground, you'll feel like you're entering a sake rabbit hole. Relaxed, grungy romantic vibe, Sake Bar Decibel is a great alcohol hidden gem. Come during a weekday to avoid too much of a wait. Attentive, nonintrusive service.Sake Bar Decibel is a great place to keep in your back pocket for when you need a good date booze joint.
Linda S.}Flushing, NY}146}261}92}-1}5}1/14/2013}Totally a favorite place to go with friends who lived with me in Japan. So cool, so downlow and unpretentious, and both times I went just happened to be sake tasting nights (free sake!) Excellent sake selection and strong cocktails. You'll be in for some awesome, friendly service, so tip well ;)Come early because the place gets packed and there's not a lot of seating.
Misha T.}Honolulu, HI}617}3819}97}18}4}1/4/2013}This place could be real easy to miss if you're not looking for it but I'd say it's worth the effort to find.Unfortunately when I went to Decibel I was too sick to drink but I still ate a lot and the food was all quite good. highlights were the sausages, salmon chazuke, chashu, and the wasabi octopus. I'm totally going to go back when I'm in better health to eat more and more importantly sample their massive sake selection.
Kevin K.}Englewood Cliffs, NJ}30}63}1}-1}5}12/27/2012}Underground but above and beyond other places in the area. It's easy to miss if you're not led there; there are no signs for it. Small with tables abutting other tables, be ready to literally rub shoulders with your neighbors. Along with the graffiti covered walls, it lends itself an ironically grungy, intimate vibe. The food is excellent, the home made soba was especially notable. The focus is on the sake and they do have an excellent selection for reasonable pricing. The wait staff is great guide through it and they will steer you towards what would drink themselves. My waiter recommended a sake and brought glasses of more expensive sake to compare to what I had ordered. Get the Nanbu Bijin, you don't regret it.
Paran Y.}Brookline, MA}66}197}106}-1}5}12/9/2012}As I sit here and reflect on my weekend debaucheries in NYC while drinking some amazing 20 year old Kirkland brand (yes, Kirkland) whiskey, I ponder what I was the most excited to write a review about. Katz? Janes? Levain? Halal Cart? Joes Shanghai? No. No. No. No. And No.Maybe it was the company of friends. Maybe it was the ambience. Maybe it was the people standing on top of the tables writing their names on the white ceiling in sharpie. Maybe it was the cute waitresses. But I really loved this place. The dirtiness, the unpretentiousness, the waitresses. Wait did I already say that?Props to you if you read that first part in the voice of Anthony Bourdain. Apparently I ironically get pretentious on Costco booze.On a more serious note, I walked in here after going to Angel Share. Massive disappointment from there and their $16 version of a screwdriver (Moanin'). Come here and its bustling with the right amount of people and the right amount of noise. I know NOTHING about sake but found that the ones that could very well describe the consistency of semen tasted the best. I'm 100% serious. Don't believe me? Give it a shot!
Rachel S.}Phoenix, AZ}337}150}116}-1}4}12/7/2012}Unless you know where to look, you'll def miss it. Clearly remember yelling directions to someone in our party over the phone, not that I can give them to you now. It was an intense happy hour before stumbling into this little place. Smells strongly of fish when you first enter and it's slightly confusing. There is a rope holding you back until someone comes to check your ID/seat you. Small, dim, cozy, and a crowd that's all ove the place (locals, out of towners, young, old, japanese, us white bitches). Still, was great! Tried milky and clear sake, waiter was a gem, even after we tried to undress him.I'll be back
Andrew J.}Manhattan, NY}204}143}401}-1}5}12/5/2012}I love this place because it's such a unique spot! What a great space and the layout is really cool. This is a great intimate place with dim
Josh K.}Jackson Heights, NY}291}1298}39}18}5}12/4/2012Updatedreview}Update: Kirakuya is garbage.It could still benefit from a larger space, but it's the only bar of its kind and quality, so i am forced to rate it 5 stars!
Albert H.}New York, NY}7}34}0}-1}4}12/2/2012}eh. i like the concept. sake is whatever to me. cool location.
Sam I.}Venice, CA}32}142}5}-1}3}11/25/2012}Keep your eyes on your bill.I love this place, but both times I have been here, there were extra items on the tab. They cleared it up and apologized, but 2 out of 2, and in a dark bar, is a bit much.
jaclyn g.}Los Angeles, CA}375}219}170}-1}4}11/14/2012}i'm weirdly into this sake bar. 1. if you aren't aware of what you're looking for, you could miss it. it's hidden down some stairs on a side street of 2nd ave2. it smells strange in the entrance bc they are making fresh sushi. they card you in this random little spot 3. they then escort you in the back to this tightly packed dimly lit room with probably no more than 60 seats. if even that.4. the menu is massive on varieties of sake all pretty reasonable. 5. the crowd spanned from nyu kids to tourists in the village, still all pretty chillthis place is definitely a guilty pleasure and i will be back#thirstythursday
Kathy V.}Hercules, CA}901}694}3200}18}4}11/6/2012}Hidden bar located in the St.Marks area, looking upon the entrance I thought wow this place is tiny!!! The aroma of sushi fills the air, and the lights are very dim. I walk up to one of the waitresses and add my name to the list. Apparently there is a back room filled with about 50 patrons. Crowded but they make it work with small tables and candles lit around this hideaway. Sake Bar Decibel looked liked someones garage/basement converted into a popular sake joint.Their menu consists of many items from alcoholic beverages to food. We decided to get a light snack-Tofu salad & edamame. To drink? Lychee sake martini-ahh yeah feeling thirsty but hits the spot. I would have to say Sake decimal was the perfect kick it spot. Chill, laid back, hidden gem, good food.
James G.}Honolulu, HI}431}87}165}-1}5}10/23/2012Updatedreview}Came here again and again. I was in New York this time for 2 weeks and i visited this place 3 times. Great sake and good service. Food is okay but I come to Sake Bar Decibel to drink!  Some sake must tries are Dewazakura Dewasansan, Tedorigawa Yamahai Daiginjo, Hoyo Genji. If you want to try some good specialty sakes Kamoizumi Nigori is a good unfiltered to try and Kamoizumi Komekome is a sweet, lower alcohol, specialty sake. A year after my first couple visits and still 5 stars. To add to the coolness of this place, we saw Daniel Craig and Rachel Weiss drinking at the bar here.
Veronica C.}New York, NY}24}109}15}-1}5}10/22/2012}Looking for a hip new spot? This is THE place. If you've ever been to Japan, you'll feel it as soon as you walk in.....this is as close as it gets. An impressive sake list, okonomoyaki, and delicious dumplings....how can you go wrong? Decibel is a speak easy of sorts, as it is underground and hidden beneath the youthful blaze of the East Village. Want a solid sake bar experience? This is your joint. This has easily become my favorite new spot in the city. Bravo, Decibel. You're doing it right!!!
Adam C.}Chicago, IL}0}4}0}-1}5}10/21/2012}awesome place, love walking in and then it opens up into the back room.  great recommendations on sake and food is actually pretty good.
Gene W.}Manhattan, NY}30}44}10}-1}5}10/20/2012}Note, the 5 stars is for my first and only experience thus far, so keep that in mind. Also, caveat #2: I am not a sake connoisseur - in fact, there's a lot I don't know about it - but I am learning.I came with my friend Charles, who is ethnically Korean but culturally Japanese, and our friend Jade, whom I consider pretty much an expert in Japanese culture/food history, the point being that I was way out of my element. But, MAN was this bar cool!Definitely had a little bit of the "speakeasy" feel, though less prohibition and more just, "oh shit I just stepped into another world (Tokyo)."I'm sure the waiters speak English, but I don't know because both my friends just spoke Japanese to them the entire time. They were super friendly and courteous, as you'd expect, even when later on in the night, they asked us if we could give up half of our table to another party since they were getting so packed.Now, the sake. I told my friend that I was clueless, but that when it comes to alcohol, I tend to like my flavors strong. I love tannin in wine, and hops in beer. So, he recommended one of the Ginjo sakes.When it came, it was in this awesome cup-within-a-cup arrangement that my un(Japanese)cultured ass had never seen before. The waiter poured the sake into the center one so that it overflowed out into the second one. It was super cool. And the taste? WOW. Delicious! I did not even know sake could taste like that! I swear, I did this 5-sake tasting thing once a long time ago where I thought 3 out of 5 of them all tasted the same..So yes, this was a different experience. And, I don't know if it was a combination of my being there with the right people, or what, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it, and look forward to being back.
Gina F.}Manhattan, NY}5}28}0}-1}3}10/3/2012}I was recommended to go visit, my hot sake was luke warm on both orders and the place smelled like mold. I'm not sure if that's good for health.
P H.}Grand Prairie, TX}2104}1595}4321}-1}4}9/29/2012}A little hidden gem in East Village. I never knew this place because it was underground. Tip:-Come early bc this place gets packed and you'll end up waiting-The ambiance is perfect bc its dark and lit by candles-Plenty of sake selection as well as food choices-Come in a small group so you can all be seated quicker
Alex W.}New York, NY}6}130}0}-1}3}9/26/2012}If you're in the mood for a really expansive selection of sake in a dimly lit, divey Japanese bar in a basement, then this is your place. It's cramped, and you may get a bit rushed by the service, but it's still a really cool place to grab a couple drinks if you're around the area.
Tiffany L.}Spokane, WA}521}607}684}18}4}9/25/2012}I thought this place was pretty special. Hidden and underneath ground, we were walking down the street its' on pretty tipsy one Monday night. Our best friend visiting us from California, who had never seen New York, was intrigued with everything. "What's that?" "What's this?" "What's down there?" As we passed Sake Bar Decibel, he creepily peered into the window and asked the later. "I don't know," I said, "let's go find out."As we walked in, I initially thought this place was just the tiny room you first walked into that's smaller than a studio apartment. But we were brought back into a what-felt-like secretive back room and sat at a half-booth half-table. The place feels legit, like drinking in an underground bar in Tokyo. The place is dingy, dirty, and was hot and stuffy as hell. But they're all of these things in a good way.The walls are graffiti stained with contributions from customers. I liked reading them, my favorite being something that said, "The next time I read this, I will be living in New York City."This place is open til 3AM every night except Sunday (open til 1). Since we weren't hungry and it was close to 2:30 in the morning, we just had some drinks. The Sake list is long and extensive. And quite intimidating. Their Cocktail list was short but solid. I had the Lychee Martini - it was good, not as fruity as most others I've had, and quite strong. Saketini was good, as well, but the Rio was my favorite.Service was slower but pleasant, I'd return!
Annie L.}Cliffside Park, NJ}16}31}0}-1}4}9/13/2012}This was one of my favorite spots to visit in NYC because it was so well hidden in the past few years.  In the past there was never a long line but recently the lines have been pretty long.  They have a wonderful selection of sake and shochu and the waitstaff have always been helpful.  I haven't really eaten in there because it would always be a place I'll head over to after dinner.  Definitely a great place for sake lovers out there!
Sue K.}Los Angeles, CA}216}99}65}-1}3}9/5/2012}Cool underground bar with a vast menu of sake served in either a glass or bottle. Ranging from $16 bottles to $100+, you can take your pick from hot, cold, nigori, junmai, ginjo, daiginjo, the list goes on. They also have a decent selection of beers and I remember seeing a Japanese whiskey on the menu. There are some small bites on the menu but this is mainly a drinking joint. The reason I only give it three stars is because I don't really care for the underground vibe with graffiti everywhere. It reminds me too much of the bathrooms typically found in east village. Also, I'm not a huge fan of sake. Make sure not to come too late and try not to come with a party of more than 4 people. Come before 9pm and you will most likely get seated right away. Oh and be sure to look for the neon sign that says "On Air"!
John Y.}Manhattan, NY}142}193}2}-1}5}9/5/2012}Impressive sake list, slightly inebriated waitstaff, and wonderfully atmospheric; it's like you stepped into any number of subterranean sake/shochu bars in Shinjuku. It's dark, loud yet intimate, and overall a great place to bring a date or a small group of friends.
Kenia C.}Manhattan, NY}40}130}0}-1}4}8/31/2012}My pal Scotty introduced me to this place. It's pretty damn cool. It's underground, it's dark, it's dingy lookingand it's the perfect vibe for me and my pals!They have a huge selection of sake. And i've been here about 3 times now. So each time i tasted about 3-4 different kinds. I had their version of a champagne that cost about 60 bucks for a small bottle and it was pretty good. But there's this one called "snowflake" i believe and it taste like bottles semen. I made that mistake TWICE there because i forgot i hated it the first time. so stay away from that! The service isn't that amazing, but go for the good vibes and laid back atmosphere. They also have authentic japanese tapas which are worth trying. The shrimp dumplings are grand.Kudos Decibel!
Matthew P.}Manhattan, NY}9}1}0}-1}4}8/28/2012}Fantastic for a date, really great atmosphere, hidden away underground in East Village. Writing all over walls, very dark, and moody.Excellent range of Sake to choose from, can be pricey though. Service is sometimes a little slow though.
laura h.}Winter Park, FL}218}71}100}-1}5}8/28/2012}I love this place and their lychee martinis.. Sadly i havent had their sake yet.. but i am sure it is awesome too!Also if you like wasabi, you need to try the wasabi pork dumplings. They were out of this world. Next time i go there i will definatly order them again.
Wendee M.}Brooklyn, NY}261}187}31}-1}4}8/27/2012}I'm in this area quite often, partying - eating - drinking, and seen tons of people go down these steps and never really wondered what was down there. Not until this summer night.We were finished up happy hour some place else and I was Yelping a sake bar to go to and this place popped up. I thought hey, let's give it a go. There's a ton of sake to choose from (duh) and the waiter knew exactly what to recommend to us after telling him our preferences. There was 5 of us and we had 2 750ml bottles. We also had a few things to eat; all very good.On to the next adventure!
Mike L.}Newburgh, NY}222}396}440}18}4}8/24/2012}A tight space to give you the authentic cramped Tokyo feel. Even if you don't like Sake you should try this place out because they have a good selection that will show you a distinction with the crap most sushi joints have. The cushion on my seat was torn apart.
Stephanie Q.}Boston, MA}491}1502}1294}18}3}8/3/2012}The TOILET. That's what this place smelled like when I entered. I don't know why it smelled like the TOILET but it did. It did not smell good. I came with my friend from Japan... her first comment when we entered was, "What is considered shabby in Japan seems to be considered chic in New York." I guess it didn't help that it smelled of the TOILET.We were seated after being carded. The tables are pretty close to each other. Unfortunately, we could still smell the TOILET even though the TOILET was far away. I'm sure the waiters and waitresses must be desensitized to the stench but we were not. While flipping through the menu, I was trying to find which drink would get me drunk quickly so I would forget about the smell of the TOILET. We ended up leaving.I would give this place one more shot though. A lot of people have good reviews. Maybe I just came on the wrong night when something had gone wrong with the TOILET.
Tristia V.}Portland, OR}113}80}1}-1}5}8/3/2012Updatedreview}Recently tried the wasabi octopus (for the brave only - delicious but VERY slimy and a bit spicy), and the gyuudon (beef bowl) - wow. Super delicious and very satisfying. Serious Japanese comfort food. Okonomiyaki was also very impressive- even better than at Otafuku where it's the specialty dish. Service can occasionally make you wonder if they all get high before their shifts.This place will empty your wallet but leave you lovestruck. It's the Anna Nicole of Japanese bars. (...too soon? Nah.)
Vinson L.}New York, NY}528}168}91}-1}4}8/2/2012}So many sakes, not enough time or ability to drink them all. We came here late night to hang out and catch up with some friends and it was awesome! We heard that there can be a wait for tables, but we got seated right away (even with a large group). The first thing you see when you walk in is a wall full of sake - and you feel like you want to try them all. We ordered 5 different kinds of sake varying from junmai to daijinjo sake that we could share so we could try a variety of them. Some of the girls also ordered a pear sake martini and a lychee sake maritini.  We also ordered some hamachi samashi which was very fresh (surprisingly since the place is not a sushi joint).Overall, a great place to grab some drinks with your friends and try a lot of different types of sake. Definitely a place that I would come back to when I visit NY again.
Melissa S.}Manhattan, NY}67}91}10}-1}5}8/1/2012}A taste of Japan in the East Village you shouldn't miss! (OK well you might, since it's location is down the stairs where the "On Air" sign is. Trust me, I have done it multiple times.) Try the bar with the amazing movie or the slightly over crowded back room with graffiti everywhere. The food I would only give 4 stars because of the price, but the quality is definitely good. Their selection of sake is wonderfully mind numbing, I some times forget which ones I have tried! Great for a date (not a first) or to get a small group of friends together for bonding. Oh and don't forget the crispy shrimp fries!!!
Douglas C.}New York, NY}0}78}2}-1}4}7/30/2012}Best description is : a Japanese Speak-Easy.  Intimate, dark, underground (literally).I've been late nights and have ordered a bunch of Sake and tapas-like japanese dishes.  They have a great variety of Sake and the food is very good.Service is efficient and stoic (I'm just saying...)Great fun place for intimate drinking with your partner.  I wouldn't come here with a bigger party because the environment is cramped and the seating is a bit uncomfortable.
Stacey S.}New York, NY}123}76}17}-1}4}7/29/2012}It wasn't my idea to come here but I would have been pleased with myself had I chosen it. This place definitely has character. It's dark and it's underground. It feels like a cross between your typical St Mark's izakaya shop and a divy wine bar. It's not a very large space. A bar up front and a bar in the back, with about ten or so tables in the back area. The sake list is pretty comprehensive and the grub list pretty short and simple. Did I mention it's dark inside? An easy place to drink and keep drinking.
Ki G.}SUNNYSIDE, NY}251}705}92}-1}3}7/19/2012Updatedreview}******3.5******Still A-OK in my book. The Japanese pancake is amazingly good "I want to drink a lot" food. The steamed scallops come with everything. I mean, everything attached to the scallop, which makes for an interesting series of textures and flavors when you pop one in your mouth. Not a huge fan of the raw octopus, but it wasn't too bad. And the Hamachi is still fantastic.As for the crowd - we were sitting next to two progressively drunk white-shirts who were unsuccessfully trying to hit on two Asian girls. Sounds familiar, right?Food and music - 5 stars.Patrons - meh.I'll be back through!
Peter K.}Manhattan, NY}432}602}58}18}4}7/19/2012}Favorite sake bar. Great selection of sake. You can spend an entire evening there and try 3-4 different kinds. They pour the sake into these glasses that sit inside small wooden boxes, all Japanesey and what not. It's cute as shit. They have food there and most of it is decent with the exception of the raw octopus with wasabi - that did not taste good to me. Small place, long wait. Very intimate, perfect for a date. Would come here before or after dinner. The huge red lanterns are a trip. I feel like I'm some ronin at a road side stand in Meiji era Edo.
Kanier L.}Manhattan, NY}34}7}3}-1}4}7/12/2012}A place that is easily slipped your notice but would be a serendipitous half flight underground exploration.Love the setting.Dim light, wooden tables, candles create intimate ambiance. Be prepared of the "noise" around the you especially when the place is crammed with people coming to explore after reading the yelp.Don't know much about Sake but they offer a wide range of choice with interesting names. Sake is somewhat overpriced.
Jimbo L.}Las Vegas, NV}147}164}34}-1}4}7/9/2012}If you were a ninja that needed to take a momentary sake break in the middle of a secret assassination mission in the middle of NYC, this is the place you would pick. First of all, there's no defining signage to identify this place. The entrance is an unassuming flight of stairs downwards and if you didn't know what you were looking for, you would easily walk by this place without knowing there was a restaurant below. However, if you were a ninja, you wouldn't have this problem. There's an "on air" sign located right above the stairway for those of you who've never been and aren't ninjas.Once you're in, this place opens up to a very dimly-lit restaurant. Albeit, a bit cramped, the ambiance is something worth going in for. The one trait about this place that turned me off was the stench of porter potty at the entrance, where bathrooms are, right next to the bar. But if you navigate your way into the cramped hallway and eventually to your seat, you'll be rewarded some wooden tables in a cove lit like a pub from a Lord of the Rings scene and some nice sake.We didn't order any food, but the desserts were overpriced. I ordered the sesame ice-cream, which was very good. Overall, I would recommend going to this little place for part of your date, perhaps before or after dinner. You'll have the feeling of being transformed to feudal Japan times (not that I've had a first-hand feudal Japan experience). Overall, this place is noteworthy for its atmosphere, if you're into places that has character, perhaps at the sacrifice of some comfort. Just beware of the Ronin/Samurais, har har!
James B.}Arlington, VA}0}5}0}-1}5}7/8/2012}I love this place. I go here every time i visit New YorkI GF and I drink about three 750ml bottles! Junmai is the favorite. finish off with Nogori.
Vivian K.}Orange County, CA}43}472}358}-1}3}7/3/2012}Ordered a Lychee Martini....was OK.Had higher expectations for this place after hearing raves about it for a while now, finally tried it out and it was just mediocre, and the joint is F-in dirtier than a horse's ass.
K T.}Port Chester, NY}0}32}0}-1}5}6/30/2012}Great sake, even better atmosphere. This underground restaurant will have you forgetting the hours.
Kanika H.}New York, NY}73}194}6}-1}4}6/23/2012}I came here once with an associate back in the spring.It's your typical run of the mill LES bar...in Japanese.  Dingy, divey and in a basement setting (and I'm a suburbanite with a taste for sleek upscale lounges and pretty music).However, the sake was hella good (esp. the Ginkoubai Hannya Tou- OMG).  I'd definitely go again if I'm bar-crawling with my homies and wanna do something besides down shots of whiskey.
Anna M.}Columbus, OH}0}3}0}-1}4}6/23/2012}Absolutley loved decibel.  I didn't eat anything - had already stuffed myslef on yakitori earlier in the night elsewhere - so can't comment.  Really nice selection of sakes.  Had one I regret not writing down the name of from Akita that was like drinking only the sweetness of rice.  Great post dinner late night drinking spot.
Judith M.}Long Beach, CA}229}458}539}18}3}6/21/2012}Extensive saki list. Ok snacks, cool vibe makes you want to go to Tokyo.
Richard L.}Queens, NY}796}703}14}18}2}6/7/2012}Booo....i was looking for a chic place to go to with a lady friend, but what i found rather was a rundown looking dive bar.  I read the reviews - and expected more...if anything just cleaner.  It felt run down, the look was cool but the couple making out like two horny 16 year olds wasn't cool.Ok let's remove that couple...and focus purely on the food we ordered and the sake.  The prices for a small bottle were a bit more expensive than other sake joints I've been to.  We ordered Okonomiyaki, a japanese pancake with stuff.  It was good - with a giant spoon of japanese mayo on the side, but it was a bit chewy for what it was.  As for the Sake they have a huge list - and the waiters are helpful in choosing one - but for what it is, it felt expensive.  TL;DR : The food was only ok and the sake was on the expensive side - it can look like a dump in certain lights...my opinion...pass on this one.
Austin K.}Jersey City, NJ}158}140}64}-1}3}5/30/2012}After having this place bookmarked for quiet some time I finally got my butt down to this little joint. Went with the wife and a friend of ours on a hot simmering NYC night where everything smells funky but as one who loves NYC who tend to love that smell too. Nothing says summer like the smell of garbage and the sewer, right?After reading some reviews I knew this place was kinda hard to find. Its downstairs with not much signage out front. Just some Japanese symbols outside. Arrived here around 10ish or so and when we walk in there is a small (and I mean small) bar area and a bench where some peeps are waiting. Speak to the host and he gives us a 15-20 wait time. "Okay we'll stay."We end up waiting only like ten minutes when we are brought into the back.  The place is no larger than a studio apartment in the area, but it is hopping. Amass of conversation and glasses clinking in cheers. We are seated at a small table. Surprisingly for how small it is you can still have a private conversation. I didn't feel like people were on top of each other.Now I'm not an expert on Sake. It had been years since I had any and I didn't even realize you could get it cold. When I open the menu I'm intimidated by the choices. They must have a hundred different kinds of sake. A hundred! How different can they be? Apparently like the red and white wines of Europe and America there are hundreds of different ways to ferment rice and water. I look through the menu and decide on a sake that is cloudy with a fruity undertone. It was very very good. Clean, crisp, with a slight fruitiness to it but it didn't overwhelm you.My wife also sampled her own sake which was very good in its own right. Crisp and clean but alittle more sharp than mine. Our friend got a cranberry with the house liquor in it. Upon tasting it I thought she got jipped with a watery drink but I guess that it was the house liquor working its magic cause after two she was feeling good and loving life.We ordered some food and since I have a new obsession with raw food (thanks Anthony Bourdain) I get the raw octopus and a marinated seaweed. The seaweed was pretty good but the octopus I think I bit off more than I could chew. Although I was in a pepper infused sauce that was very spicy and good it was just alittle too chewy for me. Not bad but I think next time I'll get the dumplings.Gotta say that it was a very cool experience. One that Yelp help create by allowing me to search for places like this, Gonna try it again cause I need to try more of those sakes! "Bottoms up!"
Morgan H.}Laredo, TX}0}19}0}-1}4}5/29/2012}Went here with a few girl friends Saturday night and I would love to go back again soon.  We just went for the sake and I loved that we could get two 5 oz pours to share.  The entry way was a little odd, but the wait to get to the back room was totally worth it.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the food that looked delicious.
Joanna H.}San Francisco, CA}217}285}120}-1}4}5/26/2012}This is the place you take your friends to show off how cool you really are. Just the fact that it's a bar within another bar makes this place one of the coolest places I've ever been to. The venue easily weeds out the impatient or the unadventurous. My party of 5 walked into this tiny room with a screen divider separating the bar area from the bathrooms. I was so confused, especially since we were unacknowledged when we came in. We almost left but eventually a waiter came, checked our IDs and took us into the actual bar area behind the curtains that could have easily been hiding the back kitchen. The backroom was small too but it had another bar area and multiple tables and booths. They must have really good soundproof walls because the place was BUMPIN' and IT WAS PACKED. The experience is just mind-boggling. The servers are really nice here. The predominant clientele are people in the mid 20s to 30s. The fact that my table got some free drinks after switching seats with another group of people didn't hurt either. I have to admit though, I realized I'm not a big fan of sake, but I'll still be coming back to try their cocktails.
Lauren T.}New York, NY}289}142}268}-1}4}5/17/2012}One of those places that screams East Village. Cool, dirty, and dark. You have to walk down a flight of stairs, where they will check your ID. Then you are brought around to the "dining area." Cushions on the chairs are destroyed and there is writing all over the walls. Exactly the kind of place we felt like being at. Bring a pen!Shumai was steaming hot and tasty, and edammame is served cold with a lot of salt. We plan on going back later at night, we arrived just as they opened (6pm) so we were the only ones there, until we were finished and people started piling in.
Jordan S.}Manhattan, NY}870}273}672}-1}5}5/14/2012}I came here only after being fairly disappointed by Library, and subsequently finding out that Holiday Cocktail Lounge was closed. I thought my lamentation would know no bounds(really, my excitement at the prospect of going to Holiday was borderline insane. There's nothing like raving about Trotsky to get my blood going.), but Sake Bar Decibel nearly made me forget my grief. If I was wealthy enough to own a brownstone, this is what I would want my basement to look like. Cue the surprised expression of...no one. It's dark, but not uncomfortably or comically so. The surrounding 'art' is neither trying too hard nor falling into the familiar cheesy vein so often mined by lesser bars/restaurants. It's fairly minimal and surprisingly cool. The tables are a bit close, but nothing really comes of that, provided you aren't seated next to faux Australians who assume everyone is more sauced than they because, as they put it, 'we're Australians and we handle our lickaahhh'. Not even that could dampen my experience though. I wanted to have a gruff night, so I started with my Yakuza order(one Sapporo, one Yamazaki and Coke, ordered in Japanese, simultaneously. No, the Sapporo is not a chaser. Yamazaki is one of the smoothest whiskeys imaginable. Also, it's in Coke. No more questions!). To preempt your question, a gruff night is one that's filled with lots of menacing eyeballing of strangers, exclamations of "omae!(very rude Japanese for "you"(seriously, don't say that to people))", and all walking must be done in the Yakuza fashion, which entails a wide gait with moderate shoulder rolling, occasional preening, and all stops at corners or otherwise are punctuated by strangely violent tousling of one's hair. Gruff nights are my favorite. In spite of Ron Swanson's proclamation that clear liquors are for rich women on diets, I felt that coming to Sake Bar Decibel and not trying some sake would be heretical. I won't put my sake pretension on display here; suffice it to say the one I chose was good enough to merit pouring what was in the chilled box into the glass to also consume. Yeah I went there.  The sake selection is extensive, they aren't fleecing you like at other sake bars, and there are drinks for the non-sake drinkers among you. I do have to say that I didn't sample the food, but the fact that they have okonomiyaki leads me little reason to think that it isn't done well too. There are few bars I truly love, but this is absolutely one of them.
InBeirut I.}Brindisi, Italy}152}31}10}-1}4}5/10/2012}Dark, sexy, dirty, underground, a little bit punk rock... this place is exactly what my night with M. was all about. Nevermind the mysterious dried meat we tasted.... shark fins? Dried pork? Who knows. Who cares. The waitress was a no-show most of the time, but friendly when she popped up, every 40 minutes or so. The edamame was good, from what I remember, but that's not so easy to mess up, is it. The cold noodles were cold and bland. The sake was delicious, and I'm not a sake drinker. The beer was cold, and I'm not a beer drinker. It was too hot, it was too crowded, it was too loud, but none of that mattered to me. I had M. sitting across from me. And that was all I wanted.
Chris K.}Washington, DC}46}379}65}-1}4}5/1/2012}Very divey and intimate. We came at around 10 on a Monday night and didn't have any trouble finding a table for four, but it might be a lot more difficult on the weekends. The yuzu infused cocktail I had was fantastic~
Cyrus P.}New York, NY}823}848}492}-1}5}4/27/2012}At last, I have submitted to reviewing yet another one of my precious city's gems... I hate you Yelp! ;)First of all, the name of this place is Sake Bar Decibel.  I would never classify Decibel as a restaurant, nor come here with eating in mind, although I will eat a few things here and there.  Decibel ROCKS!  Why?  Well, let me tell you. It has one of the most extensive collections of Sake in the city.  I'm not sure that it has the most, but definitely a very good variety.  The staff there is super cool when it comes to knowing what sake's you will like and their recommendations are always on the money.  For some of you that won't matter since you're purely drinking Sake to get wasted anyway.  I love the dirty, grungey feel and look of the entire place.  Every time I walk down those stairs I feel like I stepped into an old Japanese or Chinese Kung Fu flick, and I almost always look over to the front bar on the right to see if any of those cool characters will be in there.  I'd love to see a samurai and some cool kung fu character named: Pae Leoung (pronounced pay long) just having drinks one day, with swords and nun-chucks, but that's just me.  Anyhow, I'm all for the vibe here, and I love me some Sake, so Decibel is the shiznick for me!Bring a date here, whether she likes it or not, she won't forget it ;)
Batie H.}Pittsburgh, PA}1}82}0}-1}4}4/25/2012}Really cool vibe, downstairs and hidden, you could walk right past it.
Julie G.}London, United Kingdom}669}990}19}-1}2}4/21/2012}I'm failing to see what everyone else sees in this restaurant.  I've read the reviews and thought that I would love Decibel and it totally shit the bed for me.  However, I can now say that I've eaten stingray fin - which is the only redeeming factor (if you'd call it that). The stingray fin made me feel like I was gnawing on raw hide like my dog, and it was pretty tasteless without the aid of the mayo dip on the side.  I found Decibel to be stuffy, dark and underwhelming.  I've been to sake bars and I've been to Japanese restaurants in NYC where they serve small plates of food as opposed to the American version of just getting sushi rolls, so I get it... but this place was just not doing it for me.  When you walk into the dining area it looks like a makeshift brothel with weird curtains covering up the ghetto kitchen. The food was OK but nothing really was exceptional.  The cold noodles were tasteless and even the side sauce for them was tasteless.  The braised pork was pretty bland.  The shrimp shumai was good, but I've never really heard of anyone messing that up.The entire experience just blah.  The sake list is impressive though and all are unfiltered and go down smooth.  I would come here just for the sake if you're really into it.  That's a rap.
Christine A.}Alameda, CA}22}391}6}-1}5}4/15/2012}Huge selection of sake with descriptions which makes it perfect to try a few you may like. Small selection off food n desserts also but def more centered around the drinks. There are a few cocktails but if coming here, must do the sakes. Because it's dark, kinda underground, and small, it's best for small groups.
Tony L.}Fremont, CA}355}146}1623}-1}5}4/8/2012}Decibel is hands down my favorite sake bar with its charming anonymity, cultural authenticity, and impressive selection.A buddy from work, who was originally from Queens, first mentioned this place to me years ago as a must-see spot since he knew I was a big fan of sake.Its true what they say, you're not going to find this place by looking for a bright neon sign saying "Decibel" anywhere in the vicinity; rather, you'll know you've arrived if you see a non-descript stairway leading down to an unmarked entrance that seems to lead to an underground dungeon where they make snuff films.One of the my favorite aspects about Decibel is the decor and the space itself; basically its nothing I've ever seen and/or experienced anywhere else.  And in this day in age, thats pretty hard to pull off.  As such, I can how this place can really be a hit or miss - you're either going to love it or hate it because its so unique.If you're claustrophobic and don't like riding elevators or hanging out in bomb shelters, this is probably not the place for you.  I can't imagine maximum capacity could exceed more then 30 people, but I could be wrong.During my last visit, our group of 5 was somehow able to fit at one of the tables.  We all ordered different flights of sake, but unfortunately I can't even remember which types we had, but I do know everything was good.  This is probably a result of having great company and a great ambiance.I always recommend this place to any of my friends that are sake drinkers and it never fails them.
Keith J.}New York, NY}17}90}14}-1}4}4/1/2012}Domo arigato Sake bar Decibel!!! Being New York's self-proclaimed original sake bar  who wouldn't expect less than 100 types of sake including some very unique varieties. The Hakkaisan Honjozo sake with charred blow fish fin is recommended and very good. You can taste the influence of the fin in the sake, but its a tasty flavor, not fishy or anything. It is served pretty hot though.When coming here you should expect a wait, and they do not take reservations. If you arrive at six though, when it opens you should be fine but soon after it fills up. The food is good, but here it is all about the sake. Very neat ambiance with a nice wooden bar, and personally I prefer to sit at the front one. Good service, good atmosphere, good chance I will return.
Joseph R.}Miami, FL}5}15}1}-1}5}3/30/2012}Consistently outstanding. This is one of my go-to places to bring friends. The only problem is that their prices have been creeping up a bit in recent years. I also want to point out that the booths are the south side are great for groups up to 10 people, an impression you might not get if you're used to being crammed into one of the tiny tables on the other side of the bar.
Sarah L.}New York, NY}5}48}16}-1}4}3/25/2012}Where to begin? I was inundated by the extensive selection of drinks with their clever descriptions. The Japanese name escapes me, but I chose a drink because it was described as "well rounded and creamy". Mm.  The umeshu was instant gratification.The music could have been louder/more intense -- as per the bar's name. The interior is cozy, dark and sexy, albeit a tad cramped (intimacy).  There was a bartender with intense manliner and half-shaved/half-mane action going on.  I expect nothing less from an underground Japanese bar.
Matthew L.}New York, NY}60}58}0}-1}4}3/24/2012}This is one of those places that you walk into and immediately feel like you're in another country. I've never been to Japan but I can imagine that there are a lot of places similar to this. The entrance is marked by a small, easily missed sign at street level which leads you down a staircase to the basement entrance. You enter into a tiny room with a small bar area that sits maybe 6-8 people. At first, I thought that was the whole place but a host quickly approached and asked if I would like to be put on the wait list. It was about 9pm on a Friday night and we waited around 30 min for a table for 2. When the wait was up we were led through a hallway to a larger, darker room in the back; great atmosphere for a date. The menu is focused on small, share-able plates and had enough variety to satisfy the people with more vanilla palates as well as more adventurous eaters. While none of the dishes I tried was mind-blowing, they were all satisfying. The scallops were my favorite. They also have a pretty good selection of sake and shochu.4 dishes, 2 beers and a shochu came out to $49 before tip. If we're talking strictly food, there are definitely better places to get pub style Japanese food in the city, but the value and atmosphere of Decibel make it a great option for a date or sake/shochu nightcap with friends.
Mariko M.}Toronto, Canada}193}844}1189}18}4}3/17/2012}As an out-of-towner, had a blast at Decibel.Good selection of sake, but they also have sho chu, beer, and cocktails.We got here on Friday night at around 9:30 and it was PACKED.I was going to say that this place is one of New York's best kept secrets, but looking at all these reviews ... I guess not ! *lolz*In order to avoid a hangover, there's a food menu here too (not to worry!). Yay - I'm a fan.A SOLID four stars.
Jeffrey C.}Thousand Oaks, CA}51}66}0}-1}1}3/13/2012}NEVER AGAIN! AVOID!!!! Would give it less stars if possible. This place was super stuffy and possibly claustrophobic. The service was EXCEPTIONALLY terrible. Here's my recap of the night. 1. They did not bring out 3 dishes that we ordered and then charged us for it (we obviously corrected them on it because we just had a feeling they would try to charge us)2. On two separate occasions I had asked waiter for something, both times he did not acknowledge me but brought what I requested. Sounds a bit contradictory of me to say bad service in this incident, but wouldn't you find that odd when you requested something and wasn't acknowledged? I wasn't even sure he had heard but I guess he did, still rather rude.3. I ordered a lychee drink and he brought out orange juice. When I told them of their mistake they said they were out of lychee. *slaps forehead* Then why the f* didn't you tell me that in the first place? Then sure enough, they charged me for the orange juice which I initially returned since it wasn't lychee.4. All of us ordered ice cream, took at least 45 min for it to finally arrive. I don't see how it could take 45 min to scoop out ice cream unless they're churning it in the back. But last I checked, this place was a bar not Ben and Jerry's.5. My friend gave the waitress a $100 bill to break. 15 minutes later, I noticed my friend is still standing around, waiting for the change. I get out of my seat help him flag down a waitress. Sure enough, she had completely forgotten. How the f* do you forget to break $100 bill? Are they trying to rob us? Are there that many high rollers in NYC where they get handed $100 all the time and just think nothing of it?6. Going back to item #1, one of the items we ordered was edamame. When I got up to help my friend get his change, I noticed at the bar was a huge bowl of fully cooked edamame. The bar was no more than 2 steps from where we were sitting. *smacks forehead* How the f* did you guys not service that dish to us? $4-$6 extra easy had you just scooped a bowl and placed it on your table.7. $8 minimum charge per person. Plenty of other bars that don't do that.
Jack L.}Manhattan, NY}16}147}78}-1}3}3/12/2012}Cute Japanese dive bar but way, way too small if you're the claustrophobic type.The bathrooms are tiny and not that clean (surprising for a Japanese joint).I gave it three stars because the food I had there was amazing - I woke up the next morning craving the udon noodles...I know they are the instant noodles but the way that it was prepared really succulent. The unagi and shumai are also delicious!
Thao L.}Brooklyn, NY}1181}330}4}-1}5}3/1/2012}Decibel is a magical sake bar in a cave. One really cool, drunk cave, that is all you need to know. Now, vamos make ye way to the magical drunk cave now!
Anna C.}New York, NY}103}192}18}-1}3}2/26/2012}I don't get what's so great about this place. It's kind of smelly and musky in there, and as soon as you walk in, you'll be hit in the face with the smell of seafood--I think it smelled like raw oysters or something. We stuffed ourselves into a booth, and a couple of the tall guys found it pretty uncomfortable, with their knees pressed up against the bottoms of the tables--but hey it makes the experience all the more authentic, right?Just had drinks so I can't comment on the food. I had a beer and a really gross unfiltered sake (the name was Perfect Snow or something like that) -- which I tried to mix with orange juice as the label suggested. Marginally better.Servers were nice and quick on their feet.I probably wouldn't want to come back, especially not with the wait. Far be it for me to take a spot from someone who actually likes the place and finds the wait worthwhile.
Payal S.}Manhattan, NY}270}20}0}-1}5}2/24/2012}Love this place!! The place feels intimate and authentic at the same time.  It's a sake place located underground and really easy to miss if you're not paying attention.  Didn't try the food but they had a huge selection of sake and the waiters really new their stuff.  Don't remember the names of the Sake we had but they were delicious :)
Matt M.}Manhattan, NY}11}121}0}-1}4}2/19/2012}Wow, I forgot about this place... I used to love it... I think I will just remember it now though. It was a great place in the '90s and thats the way i would like to remember it.
Amy W.}Manhattan, NY}454}138}71}-1}4}2/12/2012}Love the underground experience, the place is packed and intimate, perfect for 2-4 people. The tuna shuman and sesame ice cream were very tasty, the full bottle sake was a bit expensive i thought.
Jeff P.}Brooklyn, NY}9}13}0}-1}5}2/10/2012}Wanna go someplace cool your friend hasn't been to? Wanna be that guy? I think that guy's a good thing, and so is Decibel. Been here forever, and I hope it continues that way. Little bites and more sake than you can figure out what to do with. The only thing I would like would be more of a description for the sakes (smooth and cloudy) - usually two word descriptions, but maybe I'm just used to overdone wine descriptions. :)
Tiffany T.}Sacramento, CA}204}113}90}-1}5}2/6/2012}What an awesome find!  This place is really cool, makes me feel like I got transported to a Japan!  Come here and order some snacks and a couple bottles of sake.  It's a chill type of place to savor your drinks.  Don't go with more than 6 people, you will have a very hard time fitting at a table.  My favorite (so far) is the....I forget the name...but ask for the 6 year aged deep and complex 750ml bottle for $50!  My only problem is that I wish they served sake in proper sake glasses.  It really detracts from the place to be drinking out of glass cups.  But otherwise come and enjoy!
Connie M.}Glendale, CA}80}316}118}18}4}2/6/2012}Let me just tell you this place is fun...but if you don't pay attention you'll walk right past it...the boyfriend and i decided to try someplace new...and we walked past this place and decided to give it a try...and man this place was PACKED! we had to wait around 20 -30 mins to get a table...but it was so worth it.I think people come here for the ambiance and the sake....the food was pretty decent...it's more of drinking snacks than real food...I don't really remember all the food that we got that night..but i remember ordering a milky sake...it was GOOD...the boyfriend and i shared it...and then afterwards...i got to order my own bottle of sake and man was i DRUNK after that...AHHAH -_- oh well good times right? the boyfriend got the japanese whiskey and he said it was pretty damn good!The service was awesome...all the waiters/waitresses...were super nice and helpful with suggestions etc. great fun place!
Natalie C.}Scottsdale, AZ}132}136}72}-1}5}1/31/2012}FANTASTIC PLACE!Dive-y feel, intimate, great music (but not loud enough), has a nice balance of dim lighting, tons of sake options, price is super reasonable, no problem finding a great place to sit for 4 people (given you come before 10pm), and great location off st. marks place. I would say that a group of 6 could comfortably come to this place given if there is room in the booths against the wall. I really can't see how this place wouldn't work for any kind of occasion except maybe a bachelorette party (god no!).I'll be coming back soon for sure and this time I'll try the food as well.
Sumito A.}Manhattan, NY}299}418}1032}-1}5}1/31/2012}Get to the Chase:Pros:1) AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! It's such a hole in the wall that it makes you think you're in somewhere only a few would know...and it stays true to the Japanese izakaya feeling2) Food is amaazing! Friends and I decided at 1:30 AM to do a tapas style thing, which allowed us to sample so much from the menu3) AFFORDABLE and DELICIOUS....for 4 people ordering over 5+ appetizers, 2 bottles of sake and 2 entrees split it was barely $40/ person4) The waiters know their stuff! Our's explained the history, region, and taste of the sake likea  pro...probably a sake sommelier!5) Perfect for lunch, dinner, and/or late night snacking/eating/binging :pCons:1) NONE
Candice G.}Silicon Valley, CA}4938}2725}18793}18}4}1/30/2012}Wait- so this isn't a cock fighting ring?Really? Because they only use red light bulbs. Are you sure? Seriously, what kind of real business only uses red light bulbs? Well okay. I *guess* I'll have to take your word for it since I saw neither feather nor fowl and they did offer a pretty vast selection of exactly the type of thing their name suggested they'd have: Sake.This was not only my first time at a semi-shady, bomb shelter-y looking New York sake bar/possible playing field for many a game of Russian Roulette-, but this was my first time at any sake bar ever! There's a first time for everything, right? And I'm glad I gave up my sake V-card to the Dec bar.  With good, nay- GREAT company in tow, we headed to the caverns of Decibel for a nightcap of epic yelping proportions. I see Decibel as the perfect environment for an intimate conversation with one, or in our case, eleven. It also seems like the kind of place you'd go on a first date after you've already done dinner and an after dinner drink but aren't quite ready to go home yet. This is a make or break it spot. If you get the sake, I guarantee you're gonna make it and at least one of you won't be headed home. I'm sure many a first date have turned into a first morning after making this a 'supposed' last stop for 'just one more drink'. I mean, c'mon! They've got red lights already... and you know they don't call it the 'red light district' for nothing. It means doing it- Period. It's subliminal is all I'm saying.Anyway, I went home alone- natch. But that doesn't mean I didn't have a good time or any less valid a time than those who go do home and get lucky. My experience was a good one and lucky for me, the crowd I was with had enough experience to order up a mighty tasty bottle of sake for the table.After 2 bottles of sake, a few bowls of edamame, and various other passed treats, I was able to leave comfortably before midnight with the perfect professional buzz (this means I was on good booze behavior) to accompany me on my cab ride back to the hotel. All in all, a successful night of mixing, mingling, and taking a stab at feeling what NY cool feels like. Super fun and if I have the chance I'm totally going to recommend it to a friend in a total 'too cool for school' way like, yeah- there's this place I go when I'm in New York, but I don't know if it'd be your thing. It's pretty obscure and kind of on the hush hush.
Michael P.}Brooklyn, NY}31}49}2}-1}5}1/30/2012}I love this place and have been many times but have not yet wrote a review of it.  Although it is an undergournd basement with concrete punk decor it is very comforting as it gives a very old school east village vibe, and suprisingly very cozy and warm.  They have a never ending list of sake cold or warm.  I have not eaten many items on the menu so cannot comment on that but always a great spot to stop by for some drinks
Henry L.}Brooklyn, NY}84}94}0}-1}2}1/29/2012Updatedreview}I'm not sure what happened to the service here.I came here early evening on New Year's Eve. The place was pretty quiet. But that didn't stop the waiters to be absolutely catatonic. The service was slow. They brought me the wrong sake bottle that I ordered, which ended up being 3-4 dollars more expensive. When the check came and I had discovered this, I had pointed it out to the waiter and with an empty look she just responded "yeah, that's the wrong one." No offer for compensation for their mistake. No offer to charge me for the sake price that I had ordered. No apologies for their shitty service.So no tip.
Chloe Z.}Woodside, NY}30}22}0}-1}5}1/25/2012}I love this place!!!!  Always such a great vibe.  Dark, underground, with candles.. a bit loud but in a good way, so you have to lean in closer to your friend to hear them.  Makes it feel festive and crowded like a party, yet intimate.  Did I mention the sake?  Can't be beat for selection; the staff always kindly offers recommendations when you ask.  I'm happy with the prices; I also always get edamame and they give you a TON for something like $2.
Jeff M.}San Francisco, CA}14}81}0}-1}4}1/24/2012}I was here for dinner and was pretty impressed.  I had a few dim-sum like appetizers and a glass of sake, which were all quite tasty.  If you like sake, there were literally hundreds of choices!  The place was super underground and felt almost like a hidden prohibition-era style place, but once you were inside it had a nice ambiance and vibe.  I'll have to go again and really get into the menu more, but I like what I had and would definitely return.
Nene K.}San Francisco, CA}172}280}6}-1}4}1/23/2012}Sake Bar Decibel is like a 90s punk, grunge-soaked version of a Japanese izakaya. It is a uniquely American take on the classic Japanese gastropub. Having just returned from a trip to Tokyo, I was charmed by what looked to be an izakaya's prodigal son who came back to practice the family trade but still kept some of the wild airs from a more exciting past life. My friend, Alexandra M. and I ordered 2 flasks of the cheaper sakes and they were both fantastic. I second the positive okonomiyaki reviews -- the okonomiyaki here is LEGIT albeit, a little on the small side :(. It tastes homemade and very authentic. The hamachi sashimi was also delicious. Both the drink and the food menus are extensive and I wish I had the time and the money to sample all of them. The wait staff is all Japanese which is very cool. A great opportunity to practice your Japanese if you're studying the language. I fell in love with this place, its quirkiness, its semai-ness (narrow-ness), its drink and food. I think you will too.
Monica J.}New York, NY}121}151}32}-1}5}1/22/2012}I had noticed this place on one of my visits to my favourite tea house (Cha-An, definitely worth checking out!) but never gave it much thought until I read a write up of it in some NY magazine/publication. I had been meaning to make it over for awhile but as things usually go, I never made it out. So, on a Saturday night after deciding that walking over to the west village for a jazz show was too much effort -especially after the first snow this season, brrr!- what was a guy and a girl to do? Check out a previously unexplored establishment in the neighborhood of course! I dragged my "friend" over to this place and upon entering I felt as though I had walked into a completely different world. I was a little nervous that he wouldn't be a fan but as I later found out, his initial internal reaction was "Dudeeee, you rock!"   Well said, sir. The first room has a tiny tiny sushi bar and I wondered if that was it and how would we ever get a seat there? Not to worry, it wasn't but a few seconds before an awesome looking dude with a half shaven head and more metal accessories on his person than I have owned my entire life came out from behind some asian curtains, asked how many, held up the rope that was "dividing" the entrance from the rest of the joint and motioned for us to go on in. I walked through the same asian-y curtains and almost took two wrong turns before I found the hostess in the dimly lit room way in the back. She immediately sat us down in a corner and I was in love.Writings all over the wall, the beautiful buzz of intimate conversations going on all around us and a big menu of sake. Now I've had my fair share of sake  but I am definitely not a connoisseur and my companion had only tried sake twice in his lifetime. With our combined knowledge, it's safe to say we were a bit intimidated. Luckily, their menu has short descriptions of each type of sake and our waitress was fairly helpful despite her lack of strong english skills. We settled on a bottle of nigori sake that was described as "rich and fruity" and some red bean paste ice cream (my favourite is green tea ice cream, but I can compromise as long as there's dessert on the table).The sake was delicious, as was the ice cream! We didn't feel rushed by the waitresses at all and could have spent the entire night chatting away if it weren't for some home brewed beer and hookah waiting for us back at my place. It is precisely these types of establishments that make me fall even more in love with this city - if that is even possible. It's like you've been included in some super exclusive club but without all the snooty people.  I promise you'll leave feeling absolutely fabulous (and a little buzzed!)
Stephanie F.}Brooklyn, NY}469}445}8}18}4}1/20/2012}Adorably cute little sake bar! Decibel is a little hidden gem with a nondescript entrance. My friends and I came for drinks and sat at the bar. I loved it. I loved the atmosphere, the vibe, and the people. When I come back for a full meal, I'll write a better review. But for now, hats off to Decibel!
Ryan W.}Queens, NY}587}352}408}-1}4}1/19/2012}This spot won my heart in a number of ways, right from the get-go.1) I love secret places.2) We came with a giant party and they were still able to seat us right away.3) In the dead of winter, this place is WARM and TOASTY. 4) I had some of the best sake in recent memory here. 5) Their okonomiyaki, while small, was totally bomb. It was a little tough to sell "uh, an eggy pancake made with cabbage, BBQ sauce and mayo?" to the crowd, but we ate every last bite. It's the perfect late-night snack. 6) Service was excellent. Our glasses were always full, food came out quickly, and even though it was late, our waitress was cheery and friendly. 7) The atmosphere reminded me of my favorite nightlife spots in Seoul (as Korea and Japan take a lot of style cues from eachother). Underground, covered in graffiti, cozy and cool at the same time. LOVE.One warning: they are SERIOUS about their wasabi pork dumplings. My boyfriend popped one in his mouth and almost passed out. If you order this, eat slowly and with caution :)
Phil H.}New York, NY}5000}3230}11968}18}5}1/18/2012}As you enter this chill underground sake cave you feel as if you have stumbled upon someone's subterranean secret lair. Walking down the stairs into the narrow passageway and then waiting by the faux velvet entrance rope to be let into the dark abyss of the actual sake bar you feel as you are Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China about to go into a place where you know danger awaits.Alas, when we were all seated the night we arrived here we found nothing but a good time among the shadowy darkness. There is a terrific sake list here, with almost 100 types, from cheaper bottles to wallet crushers. I'm not a huge sake aficionado but I thoroughly enjoyed the bottle that was chosen by our table. Masumi Arabashiri Sake, which had a pleasant fruity taste to it, and served chilled it went down easy. As it was a bit warm down there I also wanted a cold beer, so a Sapporo Light was the way to go. For the table we ordered some food to snack on such as edamame, shumai, and a few other things. Perfect all around.As I looked around the dimly lit bar area I noticed there are not really a lot of tables here, and everyone is kind of scrunched in next to each other, but the quiet din of hushed conversation broken up by occasional laughter indicated that a good time was being had by all. Think dive bar meets Japanese sake bar meets speakeasy and that is what you will find here. Plus, the servers will let you split up the check with cash and credit cards if needed. Service is a bit on the slow side, but no one minds as you are all here to relax a bit and have a good time. You don't rush an experience at a sake bar, especially one in a secretive and sexy underground cave-like atmosphere.Just a terrific spot to end off the night with a friend, or small group with some delicious sake and good conversation.
Dan J.}Los Angeles, CA}100}166}13}-1}5}1/17/2012}A chill place to drink some sake.  Or lychee martini for the ladies.What a fantastically cozy little sake bar joint in the East Village. I think I'm in love.I'm not from New York, so it was a little hard to find, but I am sure glad I did.  There's a small sign on 9th to let you know where it is, but it's very small and easy to miss.  There's a stairs that leads downstairs and this is where the magic begins.Once you get inside, there's a small waiting room and there are some sushi chefs in the front, but no one was really sitting here.  A rope awaits you near the entrance and I suppose you are wait for them to come get you.  Luckily, we came early, around 6 ish on a Saturday night because there wasn't any wait at all and it was pretty empty inside.  By the time we left at around 8, it was PACKED and there were tons of people in the staging area waiting to grab a table.  Sorry, I didn't know you were waiting or I would've hurried my ass up, but I was having too good of a time.I can't put it any other way than this is just a nice, cozy place to enjoy sake and conversation with your friends.  There are maybe 12-14 tables in the whole room so there's not a lot of space here so it's good we came when we did.  The staff is super attentive and friendly.  It was bitterly cold in New York so I wanted some warm sake, which although is frowned upon I guess, I still yearned for.  It was delicious.  I tried a few as they sell everything they have by 5 oz portions, but the one that stood out for me was the Naraman.  One taste of this and I just kept ordering it and ordering it and ordering it.  Then I don't remember what happened.The music is really quiet here, almost non-existent.  When it gets rowdy and crowded here you can't really hear it at all, but I forgot about it after a while.  They have a huge selection of sake here to pique your interest if you're into that.  You won't regret coming here.
Vanni P.}New York, NY}123}574}2}18}5}1/13/2012}Look at the sake list and be stunned. I honestly am not a big sake connoisseur and did not know where to start. Shock & Awe. Hands down best sake bar I've ever been to, and they take their sake super-seriously here. Love that so many Japanese come here - I assume it means this place is the real deal (since I'm not qualified to judge). Plus thumbs up to the ambiance - secretive little basement entrance, cozy spaces, dim lighting and Japanese memorabilia. What else could you want?
Gail N.}Honolulu, HI}353}331}192}-1}5}1/8/2012}I wish there was a place just like this in San Francisco. Sure, there are several izakaya's and of course there's always my beloved Ryoko (the underground sushi spot in the Tenderloin), but none by far hits all of the marks such as Sake Bar Decibel.As suggested by a friend who lived in New York for about 6 years, my friends and I ventured here for a chill night. SAKE: A HUGE selection of sake to chose from - which can be served hot/cold. FOOD: Delicious, fun Japanese noshes (sting ray, shrimp dumplings, agadeshi tofu, okonomiyaki, and much more!)AMBIANCE: Underground, hip/trendy with a touch of dive-bar-esque feel. And plenty  of red lights to hide all your asian glows :).And of course, it's opened till uber late bc it's New York!!!All in all, a MUST if you're in New York and desiring a really cool local place to chill, imbibe and eat.
Saba A.}River North, Chicago, IL}383}588}421}-1}5}12/29/2011}This is real time NYC experience! Make your way downstairs and don't leave without trying Shrimp Dumplings. Tight squeeze, real cool decor, and a place that is laid back and friendly. So glad my cousin introduced me to this place! Don't have one in Chicago I believe, so this was really cool!
Kimberly C.}Manhattan, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}12/29/2011}Decibel is my idea of how an ideal bar/drinking experience should be like.Oolong-hi + taco wasa + niniku = KANPAI !!!  ahhhhhhh :DYuzu-hi is also really good if you want something citrus-y. I am biased in the sense that I don't like beer and prefer mixed sake/shochu drinks. And the tapas they offer here go so well with the drinks. Come here early (no later than 9) if you don't want to wait. I wish this place wasn't so well known bc half of the times , people who bring their friends to come are ordering sapporo beer or something that you can get at any other asian fusion places. And meanwhile, I am waiting to get a table so I can drink my yuzu-hi that's offered only here.
Vivian H.}Washington, DC}1059}1915}42}18}4}12/26/2011}Remember that cult film The Crow with Brandon Lee? His tragic good looks met by tragic death. Nocturnal, goth, sexy, burning, fire, anger, pain, evil, lust, passion. Those were all the feelings seeping through my veins when I walked in here. I almost half expected to hear Burn by The Cure. After finishing up finals, a good friend and I came here for a few drinks to lift our spirits and to blunt the senses. I started off with an Indigo special, a cocktail made with sake. It was good, but not strong enough for me. So after this drink, I took it up a notch. I have a hankering for unfiltered sake (nigori). The watakate nigori has a beautiful milky hue (as do all nigoris) and it went down smooth, but also strong. The highlight of the evening was the broiled stingray. The consistency is like jerky and it is paired with spicy kewpie mayo on the side. A great snack to accompany a night of sake drinking. I will definitely be back to have more sake and snacks. I just hope I can get in (this place tends to fill up fast and forget about getting a table on the weekends)!"Every night I burn, Waiting for the World End"
Uggh S.}New York, NY}85}39}5}-1}4}12/21/2011}Soooo... A friend took me to this place and I just want to say he def increased his cool points.  It's got that slinky, tight-quartered-but-doesn't-bother-me-in-a-claustrophobic-kind-of-way, dark, borderline dingy in the front and all secret and dark in the back kinda vibe...everything you'd think sneaky late night life should be in Gotham City.   It's a tight spot, I don't know if my date had to give some super secret password, and I genuinely question if half of my party had not been Chinese or some descendant of an Asian country would it have been as easy to get in.  Not sure why I thought this, but I did.  At first, I'm not gonna lie, I was like where the heck was he taking me (I'm a classy broad) but once we got to the back it all made sense.  It's a small tight room (you will be all up in other folks convos  and not by choice), but I just like this place because it reminds me of a movie shot in the dark with all blue tinged light.  Tokyo.  Enter the Void.  I'm not even Sake's biggest fan, I don't hate it per se, but I drank it like Kool-Aid that night.  It just felt right.  Cool, ya dig?  A good spot for late night post date activities.
Ricky C.}Rye, NY}48}221}4}-1}3}12/16/2011}3.5 Stars.  Came here late one night and was still packed until closing.  Even though I don't remember what I had, the food was good and service wasn't too bad either.  Place is def worth returning.
Derrick C.}Sacramento, CA}97}1274}126}18}4}12/13/2011}How they manage to fit so many ppl underground in this place is beyond me but makes for good times.
Pop A.}Irvine, CA}388}15}0}-1}4}12/5/2011}Came out to the east coast with the bf for my birthday and ended up here as a recommendation from friends that live out in NY. I must say for a sake bar it's pretty hip, cool, chill and has that totally dark and underground feel. You Do have to walk down under to get into this hip little sake/ sushi spot. The sushi was sushi no complaints and the rounds of sake weren't bad at all. it's super dark almost a candlelit feel, not too crazy inside and totally hidden. Kinda felt like I was in Tokyo for a minute. Service was good not too overwhelming. Everyone seemed to be young and totally Japanese :) It was a quiet little romantic spot and glad I came here for my birthday. I would recommend it for dates or for groups if you want to drink and munch on sushi.
Juan J.}Brooklyn, NY}106}705}187}18}3}12/1/2011}Ok, I get the idea.  You feel like you are super cool in this dark and hidden bar...I liked the Sake but the room was too warm when the 5 of us showed up on a Friday night.  The price wasn't exactly friendly for people who really can drink Sake...I would come back again, but I really can't call myself a fan.
Radford T.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}602}451}157}-1}5}11/28/2011}Believe it or not, there are quiet nights in East Village, nights that circle around once every week.  Nights like the Sunday night when everyone is simultaneously seeking respite from a weekend full of unhinged merriment and lazily dreading the oncoming work week.  Nights like Tuesday nights when there is no rest for the weary for those who must yet soldier on for the next few days of work until the oasis of weekend comes into view.  On nights like those, the street lights in the neighbourhood project a steady incandescence against the grey of the sidewalk, moving shadows far and few in between.  In happenstance you might find me, jacket wrapped around my body in the chill of mid autumn night, looking lost with Cat Power or Hope Sandoval singing melancholy directly into my brain, digging a deep metaphorical hole and throwing me in it, and walking toward a barely noticeable sake bar in the basement of a building at 2nd and 9th.On nights like those, seating for one at Decibel is not difficult to procure.  This bar may be nondescript from the outside save the little Japanese awning and a flashing "On Air" sign, but the inside of the establishment offers a plethora of sake as well as a menu of Japanese food. Aside from a couple of specially featured sake selections highlighted in the beginning of the menu, the rest of the sake offering are described in English by only a few simple words, such as "crisp and mature", or "smooth and refreshing".  Words that, I suppose, could well be used to describe women with whom a guy could have an unpredictable adventure.  I know nothing about sake and usually pick one at random, only to forget on my next visit which sake exactly I had picked on the previous visit.  The sake come in either a bottle or a box.  And by "box", I mean literally, the sake is served in a glass which sits in a wooden box about half the height of the glass and also filled with sake.  For a snack, however, I always order the dried stingray fin.  It exhibits the perfect flavours to complement a glass of sake.  Decibel is, hands down, one of my favourite places in the neighbourhood to get a late-night drink.
Jess R.}New York, NY}54}26}1}-1}4}11/28/2011}I hesitate to call this a hidden bar because it definitely has a visible entrance. However, it's entrance is understated and could easily be missed - and this adds to the "cool factor" of Sake Bar Decibel. Walk down the stairs to a front room with a bar that, at first, appears to be the entire joint. A rope divides the front room from the back, where you will most likely be seated.SBD is decorated with a hodge-podge of Japanese decor, which makes for great conversation starters. The menu is EXTREMELY reasonable - Japanese snacks starting at around $2. I went with a group of 4, and we had each gotten a snack and ordered a few bottles of sake, and had to order more because we had not reached the $8 per person minimum. SBD is also open late.Late night. Munchies. Cheap food. Quasi-hidden location.If you haven't bookmarked this place yet, that's a problem.
S L.}New York, NY}73}60}1}-1}3}11/25/2011}I had some great drinks here. Although I'm not sure how versatile this place is, I'd only come depending on who I'm hanging out with and whether I'm up for a cluster phobic, tokyo punk underground bar night lol
Jess K.}Manhattan, NY}283}268}2}-1}4}11/21/2011}Hidden secret gem of the East Village... be prepared to wait for a table, but if you can squeeze in it's worth the wait. The low-ceiling back room with Sharpie-graffiti covering the walls is as casual and back door as you can get. Authentic Japanese cuisine and a wide range of sake options, this is a true favorite of mine. I loved the din and laughter that seemed to expand the room, the crowd was yuppie, grungy, young, old, and I loved the mix, it reaffirms my love for NYC.Can't wait to go back.
Monte I.}Manhattan, NY}0}16}0}-1}5}11/14/2011}For a slice of Tokyo in NYC this all but hidden sake bar is your place. With over 200 sakes stocked you can surely find what you fancy. If you are stumped by the selection try the Wakatake Junami Daiginjo...Everyone at the table will be happy. The entrance stairs are not easy to see so keep a close eye out.
Melissa E.}Vancouver, Canada}37}390}19}-1}5}11/1/2011}Very much looking forward to my trip to NYC and have been reminiscing about my favourite haunts...Decibel wraps up everything I love about NYC into one spot... It highlights the ethnic diversity of the city, offering a kind of grungy, gritty experience but still offering high quality booze (and presumably food but I never tried it). The exhaustive list of sakes is mindboggling and the mix of patrons reassuring. This isn't a hipsters hangout or student dive etc. It simply caters to people who like a certain kind of ambience and experience and I am that person. I try to hit this spot on almost every annual trip I take to NYC. What can I say, I dig me some hole-in-the-wall sake.
James C.}Manhattan, NY}167}190}107}18}3}10/25/2011}Been going there for many years, the crowd has definitely changed throughout the years. It has become much more crowded on friday and saturday nights. I would advise to be prepared to wait if you get in at 10/11. Things tend to quiet down by 1am. There's a inner room with tables but its usually so crowded and loud, unless you're with a group of 4 I would suggest the Bar. Its usually quieter and its easier to get the attention of the bar tender vs. the waiters at the table area. I would go for the large sake selection and not necessarily for the food.
Adam S.}Manhattan, NY}41}28}1}-1}3}10/19/2011}Just as previously described "an underground punk Tokyo basement sake bar".I dropped by Decibel on a Tuesday night and expected it to be more crowded.  I was pretty surprised to find only one or two tables occupied.The sake selection is pretty good and most are available by the glass (5. oz) or bottle.  I had one of my favorites, Wakatake (sometiems known as "Demon Slayer). For $17 a glass, the server gave a rather generous pour.The food = mixed reviews.Edamame = fine, not too much could go wrong hereJapanese Beef Rice Bowl = my favorite of the selection.. beef was tasy and sliced thin, rice was good and flavorfulSweet potato Crackers = not entirely as described on the menu, these were more in the shape of mcDonald's french fries with the hardness of a crayon.. careful biting into them.. some spots are surprisingly rock hardJapanese pancake = this sounded like it would be the best dish, rather it was a bit disappointing.  A soft puree of various fish, lightly fried (?) it really didn't have particular distinct flavor.  Somewhat disappointed as I generally get excited at dishes deemed "pancakes"...particularly zucchini pancakes, which for the best try Turks & Frogs..Back to Decibel... cool spot to slug down some sake and snack on some decent food, discover some Japanese punk music and inhale a variety of fish full air.
Lola L.}Toronto, Canada}32}61}13}-1}5}10/12/2011}Not sure what I could add about this place which hasn't already been mentioned, but I loved it. Hole-in-the-floor Japanese dive bar with an incredible array of sake, great service, great vibes. We went twice in one week because I was craving the takowasa (raw octopus in wasabi paste) after my first sampling. Try all of the sakes. And the stingray fins. Go late, they're open until 3am or so. If you're feeling adventurous, try the wasabi shumai. I've never before felt the effects of wasabi straight through to the back of my head. Phew!
Samuel M.}Manhattan, NY}64}404}44}-1}2}10/7/2011}Decibel is an underground post punk Tokyo basement sake bar, something like that.    I liked this place, it's perfect for a sake and chillout after a nice japanese dinner. My kind of place: underground, lost in translation, with red lights. New York needs more places like this.   It's a tiny place in a basement. Amazing for the first time, for a second visit not so much. I recommend it if they have table and you don't have to wait, if you finished dinner at Robataya or at Hasaki. Otherwise, wait to get in? No thanks.    I'm not interested in the food of this place. The sake was good, i'm not a sake expert, but the two i sipped were cool. My friend is claustrophobic and he felt terrible inside, there is no air, no light, it's cute but may be dangerous.  By the way, a bar with so much "style" should have good music, but it didn't. The volume was very low, you just hear the people screaming. There was some kind of pop, but bad. The music sucks big time in this place. Just go for the experience once, it's not worth more visits.
Pammy J.}Brooklyn, NY}74}4}0}-1}4}10/3/2011}Favorie Place EVER!Aside from the wait (because it's so darned popular), I love the low key feeling of this place.. And the food is great! i kinda wish the portions were larger for groups, but we're all wasted by the time we're hungry anyhow..
Eve A.}West Islip, NY}112}168}0}-1}4}10/1/2011}as someone said-yes it is a japanese dive bar. when my date dragged me there i was very close to just giving him my wallet w cash and running. from outside it just a basement, w druggy looking individuals sitting next to the door. Im consider myself very "classy" (well, before my 3rd drink I usually am very classy and tend to behave). so the whole picture of the place looked like a body dumping, drug selling and slave trading spot. graffiti everywhere,low ceilings, loud metal/enigma/pop music, metal doors,metal bars, cans and other unhealthy stuff. Im in my sky high heels, cocktail dress and evening coat looked like an alien.Anyways, we got in-promptly got a table next to hipsters, actually everyone except me probally looked like a hipster or starving artist.Even thou, im not fan of hipsters, dive bars, trashy/urban ambiance and holes in the wall- it was a nice experience. Food was interesting and tasty. drinks very strong and well made. service was fast and polite. i dont think that i will ever go back-cuz rebellious times of my life when color black was the best color, when basements were very good hang out places to bitch about how life sucks I have outlived when i was 15 and now i like to enjoy refined things in life. but its def a good place for adventure looking young adults.
Benjamin C.}Oakland, CA}154}44}3}-1}5}9/25/2011}This place wins on all fronts: drinks, food and atmosphere. The sake can be a bit expensive so it's probably not the place to go if you want to get trashed. However if you want to try some delicious rice wine this is definitely place to go. Add some delicious small portioned food (we had shumai and unagi, some of the best I've ever had) and you get a great place to chill. The mood of the place is amazing, its like stepping through the looking glass only a dive bar in Tokyo's on the other side. The service wasn't super quick and our waiter(s) had some trouble taking our order but never to the point of annoyance.
Abby B.}Jersey City, NY}0}5}0}-1}1}9/19/2011}If I have an option, I will put ZERO star.  This place is horrible.  Waiters are very rude without any willingness to serve better, if you don't pay tips because of bad service, the rude waiter will follow you to force us to pay a tip.  All food are completely junk foods that they cook with microwave,  that is not healthy at all, and the place is a pit hall waiters and places as well smells bad.  I have no idea how this place passed the inspection.  Unless you are desperate to have a sake,  I would not recommend to anyone.  Even if you want to have a sake badly, I would recommend to go somewhere else like KANOYAMA or buy a bottle of sake at Sakaya within a block from this place.
Leeann C.}San Jose, CA}144}436}107}-1}4}9/14/2011}This place was super chill (it's actually located underground...). We stopped by for a bottle of sake after hanging out at Angel's Share. The sake we ordered (recommended by our server) was light and sweet, great for sipping. There's a very extensive sake list, so lots to try! A good place to hang out late night.-L.
Vikki M.}Flushing, NY}189}201}42}-1}5}9/1/2011}Some bars are described as being a "hole in the wall" this bar is literally a hole in the floor. And what better to fill a hole in the floor with than sake, sake, and more sake. Although they do have a full bar sake is the star of the show here. The menu is organized into different categories with a brief description of both the categories and the taste of each kind of sake they offer. The selection is unsurpassed by anywhere else I've ever been. Close to if not over 100 different types and it is available chilled in a box, heated in a flask or you can just go all out and buy an entire bottle. If you like or want to try sake this is absolutely a MUST MUST MUST do. I'd recommend heading here on an off night or earlier in the evening because even at 9ish on a Wednesday night the place was packed and there was only seating available at the bar. There is an $8 minimum per person and a $15 credit card minimum so be aware of this when making your order. Also don't come with a large group since the place is small and tables even for 4 are scarce.
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}4}8/30/2011}i've been here several times, but i always forget where it is located as it is below ground level.the logo design is very cool and reminds me of the simplicity in design that is so common in japan. *sad i won't be visiting japan for a long time. post tsunami, i don't plan to visit and eat contaminated fish for a while...the sake list is extensive and the milieu is a chill, cool vibe. its definitely a little gem in the city, & i'll be frequenting it.
Douglas C.}Manhattan, NY}70}8}0}-1}5}8/29/2011}You walk in, down the semi-hidden steps to the dark Tokyo underground. You are assessed. Of course you are, because you are in one of those places that many may visit, but not all will understand. This is a place that depends on your ability to sync your mind with the vibe. Dark, hip, the walls tattoed with the grafitti of the passing-by and the long-inhabiting. My date and I had the cloudy sake, I can't remember the name. But we had a corner of latitude and longtitude all to ourselves. She talked with me. I talked with her. At some point the bar's attitude took over and she reached her arm out to touch my neck. I smelled her arm. We left. THAT is why I like this place.
Will P.}Brooklyn, NY}11}53}1}-1}4}8/25/2011}Total sex.This place is sexy, even when it's dirty.The bottles of sake will definitely add up, if you're in for the long haul.Sitting at the bar while waiting for your table is a must.Totally sexy.
Anna W.}New York, NY}152}315}40}-1}4}8/23/2011}Stop three of four on my first night back in New York was at Decibel. Given how I hadn't gotten any sleep the night before and the speed of which one clinks cups and downs 'em, it would've been a bad (or super awesome night), but I was a bit of a downer (so I'm told), sipping my one drink. Decibel was a great reintroduction, and I'm glad I remembered it.When I first stepped into Decibel, after descending the stairs, I was baffled as to how our merry band would fit, as there was just a bar that could seat 6-8, with a sort of window seat to one corner. The opposite side is the waiting area. I assumed this was a waiting area for the bathroom (bathrooms are...the new cupcakes?), until I realized that the actual establishment was behind the curtain. The actual area has three booths, a wrap-around bar, open tables, and side/booth tables. The whole place is dimly lit, with been-around-since-the-80s wood furniture, and entirely conducive to late, crazy nights. There's an extensive sake menu (duh), with pricing by the glass and bottle (varying sizes, from 500ml to 1.5L--can Ludacris or some such do a music bottle where magnums of sake are popped? no fizzing, but still). You can ask to sample the sake, so no need to get antsy about plunking $100+ for a bottle. There are also other specialty cocktails ($7-10), as well as small snacks (e.g. edamame, gyoza).Given the size of the place, you can expect a wait if the night's already started, but it's worth it.
Matt G.}Westerville, OH}51}354}8}18}4}8/12/2011}Came here with a party of 4 and it took forever to get a table.  Everything about this place is small and cramped, but the sake will make you forget those minor troubles (and everything else.)  The appetizers were also quite good.  Buy the sake by the bottle, and note that not all the bottles are the same size.  Sure the service is slow, just drink more sake and quit complaining.  I recommend you bring your boozehound friends here for a couple hours, then hit up Veselka for some food at 4 AM.  Come here if you want to get drunk on sake in an almost appallingly hip environment.  Bring a couple sharpies.
Sarah G.}Manhattan, NY}12}7}0}-1}1}8/6/2011}NEVER AGAIN!!This used to be my go - to place to impress friends visiting from out of town with an open palate and a penchant for things off the beaten path. Sadly I must say I will never return to this bar again. I took a friend there  and after being seated we waited a good 15 minutes before even seeing the menu. If this was the only issue all night, I would have been fine. We only ordered sake and that took another ten minutes for the waitress to just bring us the bottle. Again, normally wouldn't have been a problem. I left a 15% tip for what I felt was marginal service at best. The problem came when I walked outside and the manager chased after me, asking me if there was a problem with the service. I was so shocked that I didn't respond before he pointed down to my bill and said to me "normally our customers tip 20%." Not only did he embarrass me in front of my friend, but he tried to bully me into giving him a better tip. I cannot condone this kind of treatment. I will never return to this bar again.
Morgan S.}San Francisco, CA}1}8}0}-1}5}8/5/2011}A girl brought me here because she said "it feels like being in Blade Runner." Just because of that I think it might have been the best date I've ever been on.youtube.com/watch?v=ESkO…
Bill B.}Manhattan, NY}74}101}0}-1}5}7/30/2011}Like being teleported to Tokyo. Besides the huge selection of sake, the food is pretty good too. After an hour (and a huge bottle of sake), it's easy to forget you're in the heart of the east village. Very cool spot, great place to take a date.
John S.}Manhattan, NY}3}21}0}-1}5}7/24/2011}The range of sake here is amazing.I've been bringing a lot of my friends here lately. It's a good pre-bars/pre-drinking place in a really relaxed atmosphere. It gets kind of busy later in the night, but just make sure to come a bit early or with a small crowd. All of the sake here I've had here has been phenomenal--I highly recommend this place!
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}3}7/23/2011}This is my first sake bar experience and I thought it was fun.  The waitress was really helpful in helping me navigate the overwhelming sake menu and threw out a couple of recommendations that worked really well.  The space itself is a little hidden, as I've walked on this street several times and never really noticed it.So how did this place drop down to three stars?  Well, just as quickly as they earned their stars for service and recommendations with the sake, they lose a star just as quickly due to food recommendations, or lack thereof.  Yes, I get that it's a bar, but if you're serving food to satisfy drunk customers, you should be able to provide a recommendation.  So when we asked our new waiter (the only white guy on the staff unfortunately) for any food recs, he replied with "I don't know, they're all good" and then after a puzzled look from my date and I, "I mean, we're more of a bar."C'mon bro, at least sample a few of these dishes and hook me up with a suggestion next time...
Jordan M.}New York, NY}8}15}0}-1}1}7/23/2011}took a friend here for his birthday. left a $3 tip on a bottle of sake (all they had to do was open the sake and put it on the table.) Waiter chased me out of the bar, came running up the steps and said "um, excuse me, was the a problem? was there a problem with the service? the normal tip is 15-20%, so i was just wondering if there was a problem." So embarrassing, and totally uncalled for! never again.
Kelly L.}Seattle, WA}78}206}159}-1}4}7/18/2011}This bar reminds me of being in Japan which makes it so great! I dare not try to come during busy hours because it's such a small place and am afraid the wait will be long.Seems that they have a very wide selection of sakes but wish they had a larger selection of girly drinks since I don't drink sake. I've ordered their tapas once or twice and wished they were of better quality. Understand that it's a sake bar but good food would make it that much better!
Kate B.}Salt Lake City, UT}80}24}7}-1}5}7/13/2011}For Sake lovers it doesn't get much better! Amazing menu and variety!
Emma S.}Brooklyn, NY}84}222}85}-1}4}7/8/2011}+ Yamazaki 12 year single malt on the spirits menu.+ Air conditioning strong enough to dry up the moist funk of NYC summer air.+ High backed booths provide as much privacy as you can expect in Manhattan.+ Friendly staff.+ Clumsily thick okonomiyaki. (Well, maybe a minus if you're trying to look suave. Just make your companions order more sake before you try to juggle this with chopsticks.)If you don't kill yourself on the stairs, this place is totally worth a visit.
Hernan V.}Las Vegas, NV}67}20}12}-1}4}7/7/2011}We found this place while walking around the east village and came back the next day. If you love sake, you'll love this place. Great Sake selections. We had Hiroshima's own Biho sake a decent Junmai GInjo. Our server was a typical cute, clueless Japanese girl. Loved it!. This place offers what I would call Japanese Tapas. The place itself (basement) is amazing, tiny and magical (think lost in translation) We had Tofu ginger scallions with Bonito flakes. Salmon flakes on rice with seaweed. Baby octopus wasabi and Scallops garlic sauce. They were good but nothing was blowing me out the water. Perfect place to have a nice long talk or a romantic date.
April Joy C.}Brooklyn, NY}359}69}161}-1}5}6/29/2011}I love love love love LOVE everything about this bar!The people who work here are amazing, the music is always on point and it's a great place for groups (though my group of my friends can be loud at times - gomen ne), great for dates, and even a great place to unwind by yourself after a hectic day at work.The sake list is massive and even people who say "I'm not a fan of sake" will find something that suits their taste.What I usually order for myself, a glass or Biho or Kaori but when with a group we usually end up splitting a magnum or two of the Kikusui.The spot opens at 6 and on weekends gets pretty crowded and hard to get a seat but it's great place to pregame before a wicked night out or  unwind after a 9-5.
Mr. N.}Los Angeles, CA}195}57}6}-1}4}6/19/2011}I've been going here for years anytime I'm in New York. Its the perfect place to hide and have a nice long talk with an old friend. The place is small and somehow it magically fills to capacity without people ever having to wait outside and causing door clutter. The sake is in abundance. You can find stuff here you can't normally find anywhere. Ambiance is what makes this place. Seriously relaxed. And top secret feeling. Music is always good and food is just enough although not really what you go there for. For food I would always go around the corner and up the stairs to Yokocho for one of the best pork ramens in the world.
Yi Z.}Oakland, CA}721}2841}1135}18}3}6/17/2011}This was our 3rd stop of the evening and I was excited to get a bottle of sake.  The problem was that there were so many choices and we had no clue how to order.  This is a sake connoisseur's dream come true.  After a long period of deliberation, we chose a bottle somewhat haphazardly.  Luckily, the sake was tasty and we got a little tipsy.The only downside is that the place is a bit claustrophobic.  The first table they sat us at was so tiny that several people around us had to get up before we could even get into our seats.  Although I was enjoying my sake, I kept thinking to myself: "How are we all going to get out of this place if there was a fire or another emergency?"Perhaps I'm not made for basement bars but Sake Bar Decibel was pretty fun.
Wahed K.}Astoria, NY}651}734}1505}18}4}6/6/2011}I can't count the number of times I have had an evening of excessive eating followed by a night of binge drinking at decibel. It's one of my favorite places to come to when I really dont want to move and just want to hang and shoot the shit with a couple of friends. There can be a wait here sometimes which is annoying and it's made me wish they had expanded a bit but then I don't think it would be quite as charming either. The folks who work here are usually pretty helpful and have many times prevented me from ordering the wrong bottle of sake because in my drunken stupor I happened to be looking at the wrong line. The food is ok - nothing special but good enough for a bar. However I don't come here to eat, I come here to drink.
Rei H.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}6/3/2011}Love this place!  So cute and out of the way!  Sake is delicious and the wait staff are really sweet and helpful!
Stacy J.}Washington, DC}50}147}22}-1}4}5/31/2011}Bottom Line up Front: Woohoo. Such a trip, I'm dying for more. Decibel.... belongs in a Hangover scene. It's the perfect tiny cramped space to plot an adventure. There's no glitz and glam here, just straight forward awesomeness. I think just about any conversation turns cool just by being held in here. =)Expansive list of beverages: check Japanese bar food: checkTeeny tiny bar stools: checkSo crowded the stranger at the next table is sitting on your lap: checkNext time, I'm bringing the largest sharpie I can find.
Andrew N.}Alhambra, CA}285}432}637}-1}4}5/29/2011}Real cool place. Definitely did not see it out on the street and was lead to it by a friend. It's a basement that looks like your prototypical sake bar. The servers were excellent and the sake selection is very comprehensive. I came here after dinner, so we only tried the ice cream. The black sesame is pretty good. Definitely a good stopping point if you're looking for a night out at the bars in Saint Mark's.
Will T.}Manhattan, NY}85}129}59}-1}4}5/29/2011}Party of 4. Ordered sake and ate ice cream! Good times!Hidden Japanese basement with surprises and magic (not literally). Came here on a Monday night after dinner. We ordered cold sake (I forgot the name, honestly there are so many, just tell the waitress to pick one for you). Also had ice cream, 2 sets. Get the black sesame and green tea flavor. Great choices. Oh yea, the restrooms are tiny. Locals: Great place to come for sakes and convosTourists: You probably can't find this place, but if you do, it'll be fun times.
Mohib Q.}Los Angeles, CA}158}385}3362}18}4}5/22/2011}Upon a friend's recommendation, we stumbled into a hidden basement. If I didn't know it was there, no one would. Little did I know this would start off a great experience in New York. Hearing feet shuffling, and metal sounds from the kitchen, I knew this place was very busy during the dinner hour. However, from the narrow entryway, I could not how big this place was. All I knew, was that, like many places in New York, it appeared to be a business operating out of a basement. Our party was fairly large, 6, and it took forty minutes of waiting to get seats. This was very agonizing, as the waiting area was a narrow corridor, and I had to squeeze against walls to let other people through at times. It was also dingy and a dive, and this was all before I came in. In the meantime, I mused at all the graffiti/writings/stickers, and talked with friends.Once in, we sat down on small tables and chairs, huddled next to each other. We could all hear each other, but at times, had the people at ends talk loud so others at ends could hear. We had a lot of fun here, and service was fast and prices were average. I liked the feeling of being in a hideaway here, and fun conversations were had. So two recommendations come to mind: 1. come in a small group and 2. make sure you bring good company.
Melanie H.}Rochester, NY}0}25}11}-1}4}5/16/2011}what a strange and interesting place. hidden in the basement deep in the east village, its extremely difficult to find as there is only one little sign from the street. definitely a dive bar done with an Asian punk rock flare. Run down decor, graffiti covered walls (every inch of the place) and very tight seating area. these things sound bad, but for some reason this place makes these attributes awesome and enjoyable. more kinds of sake on the menu than you have ever seen in your life. definitely recommended if for nothing else than the sheer spectacle of the place.
Stephen C.}Flushing, NY}54}17}0}-1}4}5/15/2011}This a great sake bar with great music. They were playing all my old school hip hop favorites like pharcyde, biggie, etc. It is definitely not for the claustrophobic. It is very cozy in an underground, hole in the wall type of way. Their food portions are small but extremely tasty. I don't remember what we ordered cause I was bombed off of sake bombs. Remember, this place is difficult to find so make sure u know the exact address and know that it is in a basement
Jason M.}New York, NY}453}241}44}-1}4}5/8/2011}I think Decibel will always remain my favorite sake bar in NYC.  There's something soooo Yakuza about having to go underground to get in this place.  That makes the entry more exciting.  Their sakes are fantastic.  And the environment is very cozy.  Not recommended for claustrophobics though.
Kat C.}New York, NY}43}108}9}-1}3}5/7/2011}3.5dark, dingy and full of booze. i had a feeling that the bartender was ignoring my friend and me but it was a lot of fun drinking and eating at the bar. it was real easy to spend over a couple of hours there.i wouldnt bother with getting a table if you're a party of 2.
Lep O.}Jackson Heights, NY}1}51}3}-1}4}5/7/2011}You can take a picture in here, send it to a person you haven't spoke to or seen for a while and tell then your in Japan. The atmosphere in this place is what makes it so enjoyable. Tables are anally and it gets pretty cramped at times but despite that it's a cool place. The sake here is great, they give you a little jug and a shot glass and you pour it yourself. It is a little pricey and I can't remember the price because I was drunk. I didn't try the food but it looked too damn healthy for me, I need some grease! Good to experience if you never drank sake or if you are a sake nut. Go right now!
Benjamin W.}New York, NY}403}61}119}-1}4}5/6/2011}Another legit secret hide out stashed away in the midst of all the commotion going on in the wonderful city of New York.  Entering the establishment will create a sense of seclusion as if you stepped into one of the many prefectures surrounding Tokyo.  Many types of these sake bars line up close by the Japan Rail Systems for workers returning home from work. Just thought it was interesting that you can really lose yourself in Sake Bar Decibel and feel the ambiance.
Joseph M.}Brooklyn, NY}335}341}1}-1}5}5/2/2011}One of the places that makes NY truly special. I'm surprised it hasn't been turned into a Pinkberry yet. A tiny little basement place with a vibe like an authentic punk-rock bar in Tokyo. Huge selection of delicious sakes; try the unfiltered stuff. Great place for a first date--she'll think you're a hip motherfucker.
m h.}Brooklyn, NY}6}36}1}-1}3}5/1/2011}Excellent little hole in the wall.  Just don't eat the food.
Eric W.}New York, NY}17}89}0}-1}4}4/30/2011}I like this place, despite the fact that:1a) this is in a basement1b) that is windowless2) the dirty walls are strewn with dirty scribbles3) the lighting is dim, such that I can't tell how much sake i have in my cup4a) the bathroom smells like bathroom4b) the area outside the bathroom smells like bathroomWhy? Because:5) when not claustrophobically packed, it's laid back and relaxing6) the sake is good. the sake can be great. After a few, the sake is great7) the staff will help you with sake selection8) the menu has a lot of useful adjectives you can use in the future to sound knowledgeable about sake9) issue #3 cancels out issue #2, and actually gives the bar a pseudo-intimate, divey feel
Alexis L.}New York, NY}35}150}31}-1}3}4/24/2011}A little underground isakaya. Good to down a few cups of sake and nibble on a few things. Don't go there expecting a memorable dinner.
Didier B.}Redondo Beach, CA}101}25}12}-1}5}4/21/2011}We stumbled across this place on a Friday night & quickly moseyed over to the front of the crowds waiting to enter. Luckily the smaller the party always equals the quicker the entrance. Me & my date soon fell in love with the 32oz $5 Sapporo & the House ramen. A quick tip about this place: if no one is monitoring the entrance list then you must legibly print your name on the list.
Tania B.}Vancouver, Canada}8}7}0}-1}2}4/16/2011}This place has a great dark underground atmosphere and the first few times going, it's cool enough to be blind to it's shortcomings.The service is very slow, the servers are disinterested at best, and the food is unmemorable.The sake list on the other hand, is extensive and fun to try different options.Over all this place is fun to discover, but I tried a few times to keep up the interest and the service will keep me from going back.
MJ A.}Oakland, CA}159}415}19}18}4}4/11/2011}Grimy, dark, dirty, great environment for a group of stooges ready to drink various Sakes.  Be wary of the minimum purchase per table.
P J.}San Francisco, CA}327}260}119}-1}4}3/27/2011}I don't think Decibel is still an underground secret, but it *is* literally underground and definitely has the exotic izakaya feel you remember from your trip to Japan. Or from watching one of Anthony Bourdain's trips to Japan.  Or from watching Lost in Translation. The okonomiyaki, renkon, hotate, etc are average, but you're there for the the sake and, let's be honest, the late night East Village vibe.  The scene verges on something out of Indie flick central casting, but the place stays packed and the only bar in the city with a more extensive sake list than Decibel is her more refined sister restaurant, Sakagura, in Midtown.
Augustine Y.}神奈川県, Japan}139}48}174}-1}4}3/26/2011}It's a sake dive bar, and it was great.  The entrance is a stairway that leads to a basement, and the only indication that it's a sake bar is this little charming wooden sign that spells out Decibel in hiragana.  You will miss this  if it's your first time searching for it.Walking in, the first impression was that the sake bar was a tiny room with a bar, a bartender, and five stools.  Fortunately, that is just the first room, and there's a corridor that leads into another room with more seats available.  Complete with tables and booths and another bar.  The setting is something that can be described as hip and dive-like.  It certainly wasn't pretentious which is great for casual group of friends.  However, a date can also be brought here for some intimate conversations.  In other words, it's flexible for any kind of night out.Their menu mainly consists of sake and Japanese beer.  There wasn't any other alcohol available, and so if you're looking for a quick crash, sake bombs are probably going to be the only option for you.  I am no sake connoisseur, but even I can tell their sake list is extensive and is equivalent to wine bars and their list of wines.  They also serve some izakaya dishes, and Japanese desserts, but the main draw here is their sake.The service can be better.  They weren't rude, but they do leave an impression that they didn't enjoy what they did.  I suppose years in the service industry in the alcohol department jades one view of the night life.  Furthermore, the way how I was that night probably didn't improve their impressions on drunk people.In any case, if you're around the area and looking for a spot with good sake, Decibel can satisfy your needs.
Cindy L.}Brooklyn, NY}161}17}0}-1}5}3/18/2011}This place is very discrete and modest on the outside, you kind of have to know it to know that it's there. If it's open, you'll see an "On Air" sign on the front. Once you get inside, the decor is very chills and the selections of sake can literally be as long as a marathon (ok, maybe not). The staff was friendly, they let you do your own thing and is attentive when you ask. It definitely is a place to just to hang out and have a good time.
Gina K.}New York, NY}192}533}1052}-1}4}3/17/2011}Been here once on a date who paid for everything, so I'm not sure how this place rates in terms of price point. However, everything we tried was really good.  He did all the ordering because he's been here before.The food we ordered was all really good.  I remember I liked the shumai a lot. We also got some sake (not sure which one). Everything went together really well.The place is small and cramped, and there's usually a bit of a wait to get a table. My second time I came here, we left because they said it would be a 40 minute wait and we had a time crunch.I would definitely recommend this place for sake and small appetizer size dishes.
Drew H.}Beechhurst, NY}11}105}45}-1}4}3/13/2011}for a place that's suppose to be secret sure has a-lot of reviews!after a bottle of kitaya sake ... yeah it was very good ... something else and a couple orders of shumai ... from what I hear ... food is blah ... go here for their sake selection ... the sake = 5 stars ... shumai came dusted with green wasabi powder with a tiny side spicey mayo ... good too ... but it's shumai.edamame was blah.first sake bar in NYC ... well worth a stop.
Melody H.}New York, NY}178}286}0}-1}3}3/6/2011}Outside, an ON AIR sign marks the entrance down the stairs to this graffiti-covered izakaya. Outfitted with the requisite red lantern but otherwise dark save for a few tea light candles, this sake and small plates joint is better suited for a date or intimate outing with a couple of of friends. It's certainly not quiet, but it's a cool place to go when you actually want to be able to hear the people you're with. If Yakitori Taisho and Oh Taisho are for rowdy college kids and Village Yokocho is a step up from that, then Decibel is the hipper, tattooed cousin of Village Yokocho.The food itself is not exceptional, but it's solid and makes for good snacking. The okonomiyaki with its billowing bonito flakes makes for a good stomach liner (even if the one at the takeout place Otafuku a block away is better). The raw squid was very wasabi-y and a little crunchier than I had expected - I would have gone with a thinner cute rather than little chunks, but it was still pretty good. The broiled dried sting ray is served in strips and tastes like a sweeter, slightly fishier version of the dried squid served in Korean drinking establishments, and it is served with a generous dollop of mayo for dipping - this was my favorite dish of the evening. We also tried the hamachi, which I didn't care for as I felt the fish wasn't terribly fresh. The Decibel tofu was nice, though fairly standard. I tried the sesame chicken and it was so gamey that I actually spit it out.  Overall, a good place to go and have some sake or shochu while chatting with friends, but the strongest draw here is the atmosphere and the booze, not so much the food. As long as you remember that, you'll have an awesome time.
Mykel B.}New York, NY}343}454}39}-1}2}3/6/2011}I hate to give this place only two stars, because I love it and will go back. The low rating is for a nasty little trick I saw for the first time last night: If you order hot sake by the carafe, ($10-$15), you'll be told that what you ordered is "sold out." Then the server will suggest an alternative among the other sake. They'll recommend something, you agree... and you find that you didn't buy a carafe of the recommended sake, but the entire bottle! I guess I was lucky ONLY getting a $60 bottle. Some cost more than $100. Ouch! Beware!
Julie S.}Miami, FL}64}202}3}-1}4}3/4/2011}This place is just... cool.  Great sake selection.  The servers won't help you unless you ask them.  But if you do, they know everything there is to know about sake and related drinks.  Trendy ambiance in a mysterious and exotic tone, haha =)  Really nice place to go late night.  Food is overpriced and small portions but hey, at 3am, it's perfect.
Clara L.}New York, NY}95}150}0}-1}4}2/28/2011}you just gotta know what you're getting yourself into, and be down.i came with two dear old friends -to this grimy, underground, stale basement smelling sake joint, where i had one of the funnest, -yes, funnest- nights ever.they have an incredible selection of sake - i mean, hopefully they would, right?  and a pretty good assortment of japanese apps/small plates.   they're all pretty legit - but unless your sinuses need some clearing, i would suggest steering clear of the wasabi shumai - good gracious those are some powerful little dumplings.  seriously.  i still feel a distant pang of the reminiscent scorn of those little bad boys.the servers know their stuff, and make very good recommendationsthe graffiti is... graffitithe people are localsand the experience is worth the 10 min search it may take to find the entrance.to sum up, this is a winner, as long as you're aware. grab some buddies, cram into a booth, be easy and take down some sake.  it'll be one of the better nights, for sure.
Jacqueline Y.}New York, NY}154}406}104}-1}4}2/24/2011}its located in the basement and a little weird at first when you walk in but then you get acquainted with the layout quickly and feel at home. i came here only for drinks, its super cozy and chill. (i agree with other reviews comment on "graffiti", shit is just random people's scribble, like bathroom scrawlings.) The wait staff was really nice and helpful with choosing various sakes. under each list of types of sake, it starts with the sweet sakes and then moves to the dry sakes on the bottom of the list. the recommended sake (dry) nakahame (very good chilled). the glass came in a small wooden box and when it's poured for you, it over flows, so you know you're getting it all. when you lift to drink your glass, don't pick up the box with it, you're going to spill the sake on yourself, remember just the glass. (this is hard earned learning experience advice here)items on the menu that looked promising: broiled dry sting ray, hamachi, decibel tofu, wasabi shumai (didn't try any of these but oh i will)
Heather P.}New York, NY}31}147}0}-1}4}2/20/2011}The place is dingy, cavernous and usually very crowded.  We came here, a group of 7 and they accommodated us in a tight booth with two little stools at the head of the table.Our waiter was serious, but we broke him in and got him to smile.  We ordered sake by the glass and some small plates.  The food was all delicious, from the wasabi shumai to the hamachi sashimi.  They also have a great buckwheat Japanese beer that I would highly recommend.  I look forward to my return visit where I can sample other selections from their sake and food menu.They don't take reservations, and if you plan on coming after 8pm, plan to wait.
Lisa H.}Brooklyn, NY}135}269}1}-1}5}2/13/2011}All the sake you can think of situated in one small place, hidden in the st.marks area. The sake is $8 for a reg-size cup, not the shot cups. I didn't know there were so many different types of sake! I would say they have like 30-40 different types at least.  This place is a hidden treasure for sake lovers. Very good service (I like waiters who leave you alone) and they never rush you out.
Rhonda W.}New York, NY}252}270}56}-1}3}2/8/2011}it may be cool and trendy with friendly staff, but it was dank and stinky and a place that made me feel like i was in a futuristic movie where this is where people would go if there were still pseudo nice places around.  The walls were a real turn off for me, poorly written handwritten 'graffitti', some tasteful, some not.  after waiting for a few minutes in the 'waiting area' we were brought to the back room.  whew, thank god, it was much nicer than the waiting area which made me want to leave because the overall vibe reminded me of being in an uncomfortable dream.the back was a little better, but only because the waiting spot was so yuk.  Lots of couples were either on first dates, or early on in their dating career (hand holding, PDA), but my friend and I were able to comfortably talk and discuss which drinks and desserts we were gonna try. We ordered the 'health conscious' japanese alcholic cocktails and they were disappointing.  There was no real yummy taste and I could hardly feel any effects of any alcohol that was in there.If someone twisted my arm and asked me to find a japanese speakeasy where sake could be had, I'd be pressed to remember this place, but this is where I'd take them.
Artur K.}Arlington, VA}39}34}0}-1}5}2/7/2011}If you're one of those people that needs the waiters to wipe your bottom in order to have a good time at a restaurant, then please stay away from this place.  The service is bad; not rude, just slow and inattentive.But honestly, who cares?The place has great atmosphere, good sake and damn good bar snacks (the raw wasabi squid is particularly good).It's honestly a shame that DC doesn't have any places like this.
Vanessa O.}Brooklyn, NY}85}440}0}-1}4}1/19/2011}Great choice of drinks , friendly staff and I saw nick sinner from the yeah yeah yeahs there nice dark place with good atmosphere I actually felt like I was in Tokyo.
Zach L.}New York, NY}139}41}0}-1}5}1/12/2011}I'm not a huge sake drinker, but this place has changed my mind.  went with a friend and each got " chilled sake in a box." It was interesting to taste the subtle differences between the two, something you can't really do when you're drinking crappy warm house sake at other Japanese restaurants.The descriptions of each bottle were absolutely hilarious - most were extremely vague but some were just nuts and made no sense.  One supposedly tasted "fermented." Had to pass.We ordered a few mixed drinks as well, made with Shochu. Pretty small, but tasty. Not sure I'd get them again though.Ordered a few apps as well, which were pretty good. The only boring one was the Tofu with seaweed.The atmosphere was great -- dark, with graffiti everywhere.  Felt very "underground."  Will definitely return.
Brian K.}Austin, TX}169}26}0}-1}3}1/1/2011}Hard to find, but worth the trip.  The decor is very cool, sort of a neo-grunge izakaya.  Dark with cool lighting and graffiti all over the walls.  This place is tiny, good for a date, but large groups may have to wait long time to get seated. The food was good, although the portions were small (even by Japanese standards) and a tad pricy.  I think there is more focus on the sake than the food.  Overall, a decent izakaya that I would return to.
Alan L.}New York, NY}417}420}69}-1}5}12/28/2010}places like decibel are why i love new york.where else would you find a balls-out sake cave located in the basement of a random building?i've learned a lot about sake and other japanese liquors during my visits here, and the food is also great for snacking on.not sure if it's the cool atmosphere, the dim-lighting, or the sake, but 99.9% of the times i come here, i leave with a healthy lil buzz going on.
Alessia E.}New York, NY}75}132}39}-1}2}12/23/2010}The other night, I was unfortunate to stumble into Sake Bar Decibel, a place that I used to frequent in my youth. (Think of Decibel as a Japanese Mars Bar. Teenage rebellion, exactly!) This time, my friends and I were incompetent enough to consider grabbing a bite there, and even though a real eatery, Veselka, was just a block away from Decibel, we thought it too bright and sobering for us at 2am. I had a gut feeling that coming to Decibel would be a mistake, but the ragged exoticism of that bar was the perfect antidote to hours of schmoozing at glamorous Christmas parties. The Sake Bar, first and foremost, is for sake enthusiasts, and it truly has many amazing selections. But the food definitely not the star of the show, and is not worth mentioning.  We ordered a few forgetful dishes (renkon, wasabi shumai, hotate, ebi shumai, sensai udon...), and as soon as they were placed on our table, the server told us to hurry and eat, because they were closing asap (that was 2:45am). A minute later, the lights went on, and the waiters began putting the chairs up on tables. We were bum-rushed into eating, paying, and leaving with all the lights on. (2:50am, on the dot.) Hmph! Such disservice to paying customers... Excuse me, ex-customers - that was the last time I will ever go there. True, the service has always been terrible there, but this episode really pushed them over the edge. Kekkou desu. (No thank you).The charm has really faded in that place, or maybe it just never existed. It is essentially a dive bar that served sake with bad service. I had a good laugh reading previous reviews, and in my opinion, the servers obviously make their own rules and consider themselves untouchable.Perfect for first dates though -very dark, small, intimate, and plenty of booze!
Tarah T.}Buffalo, NY}7}163}8}-1}2}12/18/2010}I've been here a few times so far and my experiences have varied. My first impression was that the atmosphere was interesting and they had a good selection of sake at reasonable prices and tasty little dishes. The last time I went, I brought 2 other friends and was kind of embarrassed by the end of the night for bringing them here. Mostly, because the service was terrible. First, the 3 of us were sat at a 2-person table, leaving 2 of us completely uncomfortable. Second, one of my friends had ordered a beer and the server completely forgot to bring it, even though I watched him bring other tables their items that were ordered after us. As the night went on, because of our too-cozy situation, and their need to squish customers into the tight space, my drink was knocked over by someone trying to sit next to me. Needless to say, I will think twice about returning. If I want to be this uncomfortable again, I'll go to a family reunion.
James P.}Jersey City, NJ}70}133}20}-1}3}12/15/2010}Sake here is good and the atmosphere is great, but it gets sooo packed on the weekends making the wait almost unbearable.Selection of sake is great but def overpriced.. This is def just a sake bar.. Don't expect to eat dinner here and get full!Great for a date and some friends... Not great for 4 guys wanting to go out for dinner and get blitzed!
Bryan L.}Los Angeles, CA}56}7}14}-1}1}12/14/2010}This story of customer service will make you laugh.The reason I'm giving this place such a bad review is not for the drinks, nor the dark celler ambiance. They win favor with me in those areas. Though, I don't think it's comfortable for a large group of friends.I came in alone and sat at the bar in the inner room. I was headed to Solas next door to meet friends, but stopped by to scout for future party location. I had 1 nigori drink + bowl of lychee, total is $18.50. I paid $20.Upon leaving, the girl chases me down at the entrance with a BIG calculator and says I didn't tip 10%. She said it must be $1.85! (I paid $20, so tip = $1.50). She actually punched it into the big calculator in front of me (like I was bartering on canal st), and rationalized this as normal. I was quite stunned. I have travelled around the world, and none such thing has ever every happened!To which I calmly said, "you do know that tipping is optional." She seemed completely stunned and confused. She may be new to NYC judging by her accent. I dunno what management told her. I said, "technically I can tip zero."Then this other male co-worker said, but this is NYC. Infuriated, I say "So what! Tipping is optional everywhere, except for Asia and Europe where they post service charge... and so the NYC way is to chase a customer down for 30 cents?!" That's when I caught the attention of some stunned onlookers. Me: "You expect me to calculate exact tip, and you're chasing me down for 30 cents.. seriously?!?" I reached into my pocket for some loose change, tossed 2 quarters on the counter and left. "That should do it!"Side bar: technically tip is calculated on pre-tax, and she was doing it on post-tax. I didn't want to open up this can of worms.1 drink + lychee = $18.50paid = $20  tip = $1.50 (8.8% tip)Chasing a customer down for 30 cents extra tip.... priceless! I don't even know where to begin with this. So many issues rooted in pettiness, entitlement, and NYC egoism. If this is NYC now, I hope I never live here. For now my friends and I will go next door. Go figure.
Grant C.}New York, NY}95}446}205}-1}2}12/9/2010}Last time I was here it was a solid three-star experience.  I hadn't been here in a while, but a friend of mine is on a sake kick so I figured we'd stop in at this subterranean sake dive.  This time out I'm giving it a solid "meh."The sake and the wasabi dumplings were okay, but MAN, did the service suck.  We were seated fairly quickly but that's where the good times ended.The waitress didn't ask whether we wanted our sake hot or cold but decided to serve my friend a warm sake, which tastes a bit like that godawful Theraflu stuff you might have taken the last time you felt ready to die.  They refused to take it back or deduct it from the bill: "no, this is what you order."  Um, actually, no.  Who does that?Trying to get the bill and pay it was a bit like Odysseus's return from Troy.  It took two requests, two people, and 10 minutes to get the check; two more requests and another 10 minutes for them to return our credit cards.  I don't like being separated from my card for an extended period of time and I'll be checking my statement to see whether someone went shopping with mine.Meh.
Jonathan M.}Brooklyn, NY}54}24}0}-1}5}12/8/2010}Awesome sake selection. Great place to bring friends or a date.
Tatiana B.}Manhattan, NY}243}98}153}-1}3}12/6/2010}went here for the first time last Friday night. My roommate was really hyped about this place, so  I was looking forward to going. The actual process of experiencing this place can be split into three phases: 1. Decibel is easy to miss!! One block off St. Marks, it has a small grey sign, which blends in with the neighboring residential building. 2. Once downstairs, you  walk into a rope. We had to wait about 10 minutes in front of the robe, before we could finally get it. Note: the staff is not very talkative, so as it was our first time to this place, we pretty much just stood there for an hour w/out an idea of what is going on. Being a very inpatient person as I am, I would normally leave after the 2 minutes of wait, but since my roommate was so hyped about it- we stayed. Also the place smells pretty terrible... 3. Passing the robe the place has a very hip decor. Graffiti-type scrambles all over the walls, sake bottles, and some Chinese paintings. The crow is pretty diverse.   We ordered some sashimi, sake, and finished it up w a Lychee martinis. The sake list is impressively long. Not being experts on the matter, we ordered warm YUHO. The flavor description sounded promising, and the name was cool... Overall- definitely a place worth visiting once. Would I go there again? Maybe..., but probably not.
Molly T.}Manhattan, NY}23}155}0}-1}4}12/4/2010}I'd walked by Decibel many, many times before friends of mine invited me to stop by and get a drink with them there one night.We had dry delicious sake, though I have no idea what it actually was. I ended the night with a glass of what tasted like sake-tea? I'm lucky my friend's wife is Japanese, because I would have been very lost without her advice!It was a lovely little underground room with many other animated guests. Was a fun spot for 5 of us and still good after 2 friends left for more intimate conversation. We stayed happily til around 3am and I'd love to go back!
Carolina S.}New York, NY}7}21}0}-1}4}12/2/2010}exotic place, even for the japanese people I went with.. I've been studying economics lately.. so this is my simple way to describe itgood sake and food+underground japanese style+labyrinth = DecibelFeasibility condition: check!Utility function maximized: check!Optimal choice!Kampai! enjoy!
Sharon G.}Los Angeles, CA}107}137}5}-1}2}11/21/2010}So I guess I should have ordered straight sake since I was at a sake bar. But our group just came from Angel's Share and we were in a cocktail mood. The cocktails were absolutely terrible. I paid 9 dollars for a drink I took two sips of! I got the Lyn - it was among the worst drinks I have ever had... Maybe I'll come back to try the sake, but for now Decibel gets two stars.Aside from that, the bar is pretty cool and the people working here are too cool to smile or talk to the customers. But whatever, I'm here to hang out with my friends, and not to befriend some random bartenders. I was also off-put by the fact that a lot of the food they serve is frozen and microwaved, e.g. the shu mai. It's 5 bucks for 6 small shu mai that came frozen from the grocery store. Yikes!
Alexandra M.}Melrose Park, PA}785}272}30}-1}5}11/14/2010}Okonomi-yumi!  I had a great time at this secret Japanese establishment where I saw more Japanese folks than I've seen since I used to live in Japan.  It's absolutely the perfect non-pretentious date place ever.  It feels like an underground punk rock show that no one else knows about.  The drink list is extensive.  I got several sake drinks and got pretty drunk.  My friend ordered us everything in Japanese, so I don't really remember what we had.  I do know, however, that the okonomiyaki was great.  I would go back and order that again. In fact, I liked all the food we had -- I just got to a point where I couldn't remember what that all was. Anyway, want to go back.
Ellen C.}Seattle, WA}693}1007}120}18}4}11/14/2010}Cool place where you walk underground. I liked the ambiance of people's writings on the wall, and how it was dark and the people working there were eclectic. I didn't like how it was an $8 minimum order per person. My friend ordered sake and it was really cool how it was presented. I just got lychee and a green tea, which was exactly $8. We also got the sweet mochi balls on a stick, which was delicious! Cool place to hang out.
Linda Y.}Brooklyn, NY}224}191}93}-1}5}11/14/2010Updatedreview}I came here one night, with my sister... after a-not-so-good dinner nearby...I had a sake drink craving.. so yay.. the edamame as an appetizer is quite great with warm sake... So chew there, and sip here... hahaha..It is definitely nice drinking spot for 1-4 or maybe 6 people tops.
Norman C.}Forest Hills, NY}37}101}1}-1}4}11/4/2010}I head over to Decibel anytime I'm in the mood for sake.  The decor of the place isn't that great, and in fact, might seem strange as it's located in the basement.  However, once you're inside, you'll realize that they have quite the large selection of sake.  I love the taste of sake, but to be honest, I don't know much about it.  I love trying something new every time I come here.  If you're looking for a new, fancy, trendy bar to hang out at, this isn't the place.  However, if you want a place where you can just sit down, hide, and drink some sake, then this is it!
Kendra W.}San Francisco, CA}366}209}146}-1}4}11/4/2010}This place makes you feel like you're a member of some cool secret NY Japanese sub-culture!! Pretty sure people don't just stumble into here and are always referred to by those in the know -- b/c at street level, the only indication of a establishment underground is a small dimly-lit placard and a set of stairs...kind of like some poor lawyer/dentist'soffice.Anyway - objectively, the place is a sh*thole basement.  Pipes hang overhead and walls are covered in paper machete and graffiti.  To get to the main seating room -- you have to walk through what looks and feels like a boiler room....but for whatever reason...this only makes it cooler :P!!I know nothing about sake -- but they had a crazy selection that i hear is authentic.  They dont have much besides the 150+ sake choices though -- I wish they'd some cocktails and beer for my sake -- but then it that would probably be too mainstream for this secret hideout!  The Japanese servers were very helpful -- so when overwhelmed by the menu -- just ask for a recommendation.  Fun place!!
Lindsey H.}New York, NY}117}84}2}-1}4}10/23/2010}I love going here for late night sake.  Their sake selection is phenominal but can be a bit overwhelming, so if you don't know what to get just ask the waiters, they always have good recommendations.  The dark, underground, mysterious atmosphere is perfect for a casual date.  I've tried a lot of the food and am not a huge fan... although the shrimp shumai was really good.  I'd recommend going for drinks and maybe something small to eat.  Dont' go here looking for sushi, they don't have much of a selection.  This place is so unlike anything else in the city.  I love bringing friends here from out of town, they always love it.
Mr F G And Ms M S.}Flushing, NY}668}1041}4009}-1}5}10/21/2010}We love this place! Our waiter was pretty helpful. He helped us chose a bottle of sake that would be good for a warm sake. We love the ambience. The place feels like you're in some underground bar in Japan!
Arturo D.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}1}10/10/2010}horrible awful service. could be a cool space if the staff were at all competent. i seriously do not recommend anyone come here. i had a situation where they waitress tell me that they couldn't charge our credit cards $14.50 a person because of their $15 minimum and then had them chase us down in the street with a hostile and accusatory tone because they had forgotten to charge us for items. I've worked as a waiter and bartender before and would never consider approaching anyone with the amount of hostility and anger that the staff member had over such an insignificant amount of money.
Quite C.}New York, NY}0}44}0}-1}3}9/22/2010}its been a long time - and i probably went too early.  i was hoping that the jewish holiday meant they would not be busy - alas - wrong.  i would recommend coming late late at night - when everyone is more chill.
Taka A.}Clifton, NJ}39}50}2}-1}5}9/19/2010}Had a nice bottle of sake with some edamame and ebisen.  Good stuff.  Authentic and real chill.  We got there before the crowd came in and it was nice and quiet.   (the way I like it)
Tim B.}San Francisco, CA}45}141}12}-1}4}9/12/2010}Came across the place just by chance.. its a cool little bar underground that you could easily miss. Inside its like this really chill atmosphere with graffiti on the walls and little tables and chairs. The servers were really 'authentic' japanese and really friendly in suggesting what kind of sakes to try. If you're coming here for sake - then i would highly recommend it. I asked the waiter to recommend a few and he pointed to "his favorite" which I obviously tried. omg it was pretty amazing. So smooth - not at ALL like those gross ass cheap sakes we're so used to taking sake bombs with. My friend tried a 'sweeter' one that I didn't really care for but was still decent. I would have liked to try some of their soju cocktails, but we were actually just stopping by for a short time while we waited for a table at ippudo =)They have some beers (sapporo, asahi) and also have a food menu including dessert! We only tried the mochi dessert which was very delicious - sweet and chewy - great with the sake. I really want to come back to try some more types of sake and to try their food --- next time i'm in ny and want to have a chill night with some friends.
Liza F.}Chicago, IL}14}20}0}-1}5}9/11/2010}down a ladder, into a cave full of dark vibey magic.  you walk into the tomb that is decibel and it's cool and dark and there is crazy acid jazz washing out over the place.  there are several Japanese employees here  with platinum blonde hair - which means nothing - but i always notice.  the vast varieties of sake are listed on the menu from sweet to dry, and it's a great place to sample and learn and refine your tastes.  the food is basic - japanese street food really.... full of bonito and fish stock and very good noodles. but decibel is not really about the food - i go to drink and munch on edamame.better for a date than for a group, and you definitely wait less if you are a regular.  it's pretty low key, and i love this place - have been going there for no less than a decade. and i'm not going to stop.
Frank L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}23}0}-1}3}9/2/2010}Good but could be better.They have a good selection of quality Japanese sakes and shochus, but their food is mediocre.  The ambience is very similar to a lot of hip, young drinking places in Japan, where they do serve traditional Japanese drinks and traditional Japanese dishes, frequently with a twist, but don't want to stick with the fuddy-duddy earth tones and wood traditional Japanese decor.  The music is cranked up so you can have a little privacy despite the close quarters -- really so you won't overhear others too easily.  Again, just like a lot of the hip young places I've been to in Japan.Their food is competent but I've really had better.  It's not exceptional in any way -- makes an effort put new twists on a couple of things, but not impressively innovative; competent, but not notably well executed.  Just okay.  And the food selection is so small, that I would not really recommend this place for dinner -- basically just snacks to go with the drinks.The service is slow, but when you do manage to corner a wait staff member, they are happy to help you.  They do get a little snotty keeping people waiting outside and all, but really -- this is New York.  It's not exactly uncommon for eating and drinking establishments to do such a thing in the effort to make themselves seem more in demand than they really are, and I take it as par for the course in the city.If you find yourself here though, I strongly recommend the seared bonito -- it's served Akita Prefecture style, with ponzu citrus vinegar and  covered in thinly shredded onions.  Absolutely delectable.
Nell L.}Kansas City, MO}17}29}0}-1}4}8/26/2010}For pure quirkiness this place ranks a 5! Because the food is not so great it gets a 4, a friend of mine had some weird Japanese pancake which just looked like a gloopy mess (she is a veggie though...) on another note as far as ambiance goes amazing..you leave the streets of NY to descend into what can only be described as an underground contraband den..dark, graffitied and chilled almost like a wine cellar (brrr!)..the sake menu requires serious studying and you get served in glass cups placed in wooden boxes and the sake is poured till the pale liquid overflows..had a lovely time chatting with some girlfriends..of course, too much talk and too much sake leaves you horribly disoriented as you leave and have to actually walk home or take some form of public transport...
Lama B.}Brooklyn, NY}230}592}50}-1}4}8/23/2010}Seriously adorable.  Didnt get to sample all the sake I wanted, or to make dinner because I had to run, but it looked so incredibly good.  It was totally reminiscent of the little dank bars in the streets of Tokyo and I loved it! THe servers are courteous and the food looked delicious.  I plan to update it and possibly upgrade to a 5, but for now a solid 4 on ambiance and a cocktail:)
Miranda R.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}13}313}4}-1}5}8/20/2010}Had a great time here! The food was really tasty- lotus root, tsukemono, udon soup, okonomyaki, - and of course plenty of sake! Went with a group of 6 around 9 on a Thursday night and sat right down. It's very cave-like , which makes you sort of just want to settle in and never leave in the best way.
QianQian Z.}New York, NY}4}22}0}-1}1}8/18/2010}I actually liked this place and the plum sake I got from my first visit. However, I tried coming back here recently with 2 friends and had a horrible experience. There were two parties ahead of us, and we were quoted 40min wait for the 3 of us, by a cold uncaring hostess. Friend and I looked at each other, thinking with only two small groups ahead and seeing customers leaving constantly, there's no way it'll actually be 40 minutes, so we sat and waited. After the first two groups were seated, and seeing as many as 6 parties leave, we were never called. A party of 5 came in after us, and were seated. Then a party of 2 came in after us, and were seated. This went on for a bit, and the hostess explained that she can't give us a larger table, again with an arrogant attitude. Finally 40 minutes does go by, and a group of 4 came in. The hostess proceeded to seat them right away. The people from this group even protested that we were here first, they thought it didn't make any sense either! At this point, my friend confronted the hostess, who gave the most apathetic "sorry". I asked her if she was actually waiting for a 3-person-table to clear out before we can get in, as of course, there is no such thing. I've never seen anyone who won't put a party of 3 at a 4 person table, or squeeze us in a 2 person table. I really can't understand what her problem was, or why we were treated so badly. Anyway, this is the point when were walked out and went to Village Yokocho
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}4}8/7/2010}Ive passed by this bar at least 10 times before someone informed me that there was an awesome sake bar on st. marks.  Located right under the "on air" sign, this underground sake bar has all the premium sake a beginner like myself would want to try.  The prices are rather reasonable, but on the high side (good sake is never cheap).  And the place lined up with vintage sake bottles, and labels gives it that extra charm.  Yes, the place is small.  And it can be a bit of a wait if you go during peak times, but it is worth it.  We also ordered the tako wasabi.  I would highly recommend it.  Raw pieces of octopus marinated in a wasabi sauce.  Yummy.Will be back..  I have turn into a sake fiend."would be 5 stars if the place were bigger and the prices were cheaper.
Wai Sze Z.}Flushing, NY}110}145}14}-1}4}8/6/2010}Underground dive.  Small, a bit cramped but authentic.  Great place for Sake, drinks and some nibbles.  I ordered the Udon and it was pretty filling.  I wouldn't just come here for food though.  There's far better options nearby.  If you're just walking by, you'll probably miss it but I suppose that's what makes it cool.  Service was fine the night we were there and we had 5 people.
E G.}New York, NY}0}17}0}-1}5}8/6/2010}This is my favorite bar in NYC. My favorite drink also happens to be sake so that's not a huge surprise. But, the decor is really cool. It's very much like a small hole in Tokyo; very purposeful though, it doesn't make it feel dirty. The food on the menu is very good as well. They recently changed the menu and took a couple things off I really enjoyed, but I haven't had anything I disliked. Keep in mind, the bill adds up while drinking sake. Service is just okay, but if you want a 3 star rated Michelin restaurant service then this is just not your style.
Geraldine K.}New York, NY}162}457}0}-1}3}8/5/2010}Cool place for just sake. Nothing else - not much decor but it can be a good place to just get a drink, and then, perhaps move onto other nearby venues.  We tried the raw octopus wasabi and shrimp shumai.  They were OK, but not phenomenal.All in all, it is a very East Village place with lots of character!Despite the reviews about poor service, I found the service very good and accommodating.   So this place is a keeper.
Ronald M.}New York, NY}15}23}4}-1}4}8/4/2010}-Awesome Sake selection-Awesome decor-Awesome ambiance-Waiter sucked ASS!Would have been 5 stars....Would def go again.....just would be weary of that dude..
Daniel S.}Chicago, IL}334}60}0}-1}5}7/31/2010}Awesome... I have nothing to contribute that hasn't already been said in the 4 and 5 star comments.
K K.}New York, NY}2}76}0}-1}4}7/28/2010}So good. You walk in, you think, why I am in a take-out place? Then someone leads you into the basement. Ooh. Ahh. Not only can you take a marker to the walls and not get yelled at, but this place has every kind of sake from here to Japan. The menu looks more like an excel spreadsheet. So, get your sharpie and your alcohol tolerance together and go.
Manish E.}Seattle, WA}17}87}11}-1}5}7/28/2010}One of my favorite spots in the city.  The place is a bit hidden down some stairs and seems odd when you first walk in.  There's a rope you can't go pass, as if you're waiting in line for a roller coaster or something.  There's often a short wait for a table, but it usually is quicker to be seated then they say.  Even so, I always find this place is worth the wait.Once you're seated you may be thinking "This is is a bit cramped for space."  But that's half the charm.  The sake menu is amazing.  After a few drinks and some edamame you'll be talking to the people next to you and having the best time of your life.As other reviews have said: it's a hip, dive sake bar without any pretentiousness.
J L.}NY, NY}4}28}7}-1}4}7/24/2010}Underground, off the beaten path charm.Tight space.Microwavable frozen food prepared at your order. Knock-your-socks-off stiff cocktails.
Alex D.}Brooklyn, NY}277}89}30}-1}5}7/22/2010}How can I describe the irresistible charm of this venue? It's underground location and graffiti'd walls give it an urban edginess while the Japanese decor and fine sakes let you relax. Definitely a great selection of sakes here and at a reasonable price to boot.
Chris A.}Jackson Heights, NY}41}44}0}-1}5}7/11/2010}Ever wanted to feel like you were in the middle of a seedy japanese crime drama? Ever wanted to get drunk on Sake and test your japanese language skills on the graffiti above your table? Ever wanted to go to a place so far underground it is, in actualiity, in the dank cellar of a building in the east village? Decibel's your place!Part hip sake bar, part underground dive, Decibel serves up some of the best sake in the city at surprisingly affordable prices, and some decent food on the side as well (though it's not worth coming for that alone). Snack if you will, but this is the place to drink, and if you're here, yes, you MUST drink. Also, surprisingly affordable (though if you pull out the stops on the sake, it could get expensive VERY quickly).
Kenneth H.}New York, NY}133}3}0}-1}4}7/5/2010}I went to this place on a recommendation from a coworker and it was a terrific suggestion. We walked right past it , the sign for this place is blocked by shrubbery, but finally made our way down the stairs and into the bar. Upon entering, it was dark, smelled of a musty basement and looked a bit shady. But it was exactly what I was looking for.We ordered one of the specials from the sake menu( can't remember the name, but it was outstanding) and a couple of beers .The drinks were good. We didn't try any of the food, but will do so the next time we come by. I definitely will come back.
Aimy T.}Richmond, VA}18}116}48}-1}5}6/20/2010}Decibel is a hidden gem. I kind of want to keep it that way, because boy is it cramped! When we got past the rope, our party of 3 was crammed into a dark little corner booth. Even for skinny people it was a tight fit. There's graffiti all over, and on the wall next to us someone had painstakingly drawn a row of tiny peckers :DIf you order food, try the wasabi shumai and the green tea porridge (heavenly!). They were out of bishonen, but whatever I drank instead made me teeter down the street happy. I'll be back for you, !
Yu S.}Manhattan, NY}75}68}0}-1}3}6/20/2010}If you're into tiny, dark, underground, hard-to-find bars, then this is made for you.  We probably walked past the entrance (basically a set of stairs leading to a basement door) about 3 times before finding the place.  They have a very extensive drinks menu, and a less extensive but decently priced food menu.  There is apparently a $8 minimum per person, which I hope wasn't selectively applied to us because I saw no such indications anywhere.Clientèle: 20s-30s and nicely behaved.
Marina G.}Rego Park, NY}42}154}0}-1}4}6/17/2010}Dingy, sketchy, dark, hidden underground and filled with booze. All your average requirements for a hip NyC bar. It's a bit of Tokyo and a hint of NY grit. Pages and pages of sake...I won't get into this...if you like sake they have what you like. Prices vary wildly depending on your sake of choice. They have Soju, plum wine and other rice based liquors too. Mixed crowd and as the night wears on it gets unbearably crowded.....like this might be a fire hazard crowded....not for the claustrophobe in you.Had some shrimp crackers, edamame and a strange version okonomiyaki.Service can be a bit spotty at times....very un-Japanese actually.
Sascha M.}New York, NY}598}816}7}-1}4}6/17/2010}This place looks like is should be on a hidden street in Tokyo. It's super hidden and divey yet trendy. This is a great place to go on a date or with an out of towner. The tables are super close together so probably not the best place to go if you want to have serious conversation though. I love sake and there are literally hundreds options. There is no way you could try to all the different ones. The waiters/bartenders are pretty helpful giving suggestions if you explain what you usually like. Definitely a cool place to check out if you love sake.
Yan G.}San Francisco, CA}368}485}4}-1}3}6/16/2010}After my first (and most likely last) Decibel experience, I found myself agreeing with Danny Glover of Lethal Weapon 1, 2, 3 and 4. "I'm too old for this s@#%" Oh, I am too fat for this sh@#%, also. Perhaps, there was a time when I might have enjoyed an underground sake bar. I might have thought about descending into a dark, damp, dank, smelly basement in hopes of finding a hidden gem. I might have looked past the overly stylish Asian twenty-somethings ready to lift the velvet rope and let you in. I might have enjoyed trying to squeeze into a tiny chair at a tiny table in a tiny corner of a tiny dining area. I might have enjoyed raising my voice to obnoxiously high Decibel levels to get my point across. Ten years ago, I might have even found the graffiti on the wall cute, and I might have even used the bathroom at this place. But I didn't. The tiny table, by the way, was barely big enough for two, but, defying laws of geometry and NYC fire department ordinances, Decibel managed to bring my friend a tiny bar stool to fit three big guys at our tiny table. I did enjoy people watching, however, even though it was dark and people were packed in like Iwashi. Sorry, a little sushi joke here.  We ordered a bottle of sake and pickled octopus ($23 total). Since Decibel had an $8 per person minimum, we asked them to add shrimp chips for $1. I don't do shellfish, so pickled octopus wasn't for me. I am not sure if it's any better than fresh or fried octopus, but just saying the words "pickled octopus" makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. I took two shots of sake, ate most of the shrimp chips and got the hell out of there. I had never been happier to see E. 9h Street again! I wasn't sure how to rank this place, because I am obviously not a good authority on dive sake bars. I am going with a safe 3 star rating as to not to add or subtract from this place. I can't honestly say "Meh, I've experienced better" when I really have not.
Richard A.}Atlanta, GA}356}179}626}18}3}6/16/2010}There's so much to choose from and I was not sure of what to drink?  I felt like I should have been a sake aficionado to really enjoy.  However the atmosphere made you feel as if you were in some underground joint.  Overall, had a great time having drinks with 7 other friends squeezed into a little corner.One thing they could work on, is the air circulation, it was a little hot and musty smelling during that summer night.  Maybe it's better in the colder months?
Raven M.}Las Vegas, NV}345}149}1592}-1}4}6/14/2010}If you want an authentic Japanese Sake sipping experience, head to Decibel. It's grungy graffiti rock n' roll style matched with an uncompromised sake serving style. I felt like I was in an underground sake bar in Tokyo- on the outskirts of some sketchy neighborhood- except I was perfectly safe nestled in the East village.The Unique Sake selection is my favorite, though small, it makes for some great drinking; particularly 'Himezen'. And an easy Daiginjo on a budget would be the 'Mu'. The overflowing sake cup is apart of Japanese tradition for being generous.For food I kept it small- A bowl of Lychee Fruit really hits the spot- freshness can be anticipated.&Takowasa- wasabi raw octopus is a real pleaser for me, spicy kick (I'm a big fan of Tako in general though)&Ochazuke- green tea over rice with savory toppingsbegins somewhat soupy (green tea) but the rice really soaks it up, really delicious all around. Sit at the bar if you're in the mood for something more low key yet rock n roll- wait for a table if you're with a group of friends or plan on ordering more food than sake.
Lily T.}New York, NY}686}911}719}18}4}6/12/2010}I like this place. I would never have come in here if a friend didn't take us there. It's underground, and it's dark. They have a wide selection of sakes that are pretty reasonably priced and good!I have not tried the food here besides the shrimp crackers which was just like any shrimp crackers you can get from asian food market. The place gets packed on weekends and fridays. Expect to wait for about 15 to even 25 mins. The only complaint I have is the tables are small and packed together, and its a bit loud in there. But def one of the cool places in East Village!
Ted L.}New York, NY}160}255}0}-1}4}6/9/2010}I feel so comfortable in this place for some reason. It must be the fact that it's dark and the waitstaff generally doesn't bother you once you've ordered a bottle. Despite the fact that there's a wait to get in during peak hours, I've never felt rushed out. The sake selection is larger than I could ever be able to conquer. I'm not a connoisseur; I barely know the difference between the different types, let alone the individual brands of each type. But I do enjoy sipping the stuff all night. Note that it's not open until 4am. I want to say that it closes at 3 on weekends. Also note that this is strictly for groups of 2 or 3. Any larger a crowd and I'm not sure they'd even be able to seat you. The food served here is an afterthought-- it's stuff to gnaw on while you drink. But you don't come here for the food. Get dinner before or after.
Steve M.}Austin, TX}1}16}0}-1}5}6/8/2010}Hard to find but worth it. It's got kind of an exclusive feel to it, and it usually packed with couples because it's the kind of place she will be impressed by. Just make sure you know how to get there ahead of time. And... not much food, but what they do have is superb.
Sarah S.}Hoboken, NJ}0}2}0}-1}2}5/30/2010}Urban Legend: A man is sitting in a dirty, underground bar having a drink. He feels a sudden pinch on his knee as though he has been bitten. Seeing nothing untoward he continues with his imbibing, shrugging off the sensation as a bodily twitch. After some moments he feels another unmistakable bite. He slaps his knee, as though to squash his unseen nemesis, then shakes out his pants leg. A balled-up cockroach, the size of a quarter, falls to the floor. As the bug attempts to crawl away the man stomps it.Unfortunately, my boyfriend got a taste of this legend at Decibel tonight, when a giant cockroach crawled into the leg of his jeans and bit him twice before he could shake the perpetrator out. To make the story even more horrifying when we alerted a waitress she swept the carcass up with nary a word to us. Finally, after a fellow guest informed the manager (who was picking his nose all night) he comped my boyfriend's drink but none of ours, though we were twitching in our seats, pants rolled up to the knee. Yes, Decibel is a subterranean bar and cockroaches can be a fact of life in these settings. Patrons who are subjected to the horrors of having one of the little devils make a home in their clothing however should be compensated accordingly. A free round of drinks would have gone a long way in changing this fright night into a funny story.
Elissa S.}New York, NY}126}279}23}-1}4}5/26/2010}It's easy to miss, as all the other reviewers have mentioned. It's literally an underground sake bar. They have some pretty strict credit card/payment rules. 1) There is a $20 minimum credit card charge. 2) Each party has to order at least $8 per person. This is actually one of my favorite place to go with out-of-towners. How many other underground sake dive bars have you been too? I've never taken anyone here that didn't have a good time. It gets super crowded, so come here early or come her on a weekday. They have some tasty snacks, including a childhood junk food favorite - shrimp chips. Mmmm.
Vincent B.}New York, NY}2}13}0}-1}5}5/23/2010}This place is a real trip to Tokyo. I love it. The ambiance is great and the waiters are always happy to guide you through the wide selection of sake they offer. The food is definitely Japanese and an acquired taste when it comes to raw octopus and lotus roots.
Philip N.}San Ramon, CA}67}246}89}-1}4}5/20/2010}I am going to admit my failure as a reviewer right off the bat by saying that I don't exactly know why I like Decibel so much.Perhaps because it's a bit of a dive sake bar, inconspicuously tucked away underground.Or it could do with the environment which is relaxed and fun.  I still can't decide whether it intentionally is trying to be grungy (because intentionally messy = cool, remember?) or if it is just a bit of a dump.  Either way, it still works for me.Or perhaps it's the fact that they have an awesome sake collection, all of which is fairly reasonably priced.Or maybe I just like drinking my glasses of sake out of a box.Or perhaps it's the fact that I always have a great time that I'm there.Nevermind, I remember now why I like the place so much.  I rescind any self-criticism.  For extra measure, I rock.
Pauline M.}Culver City, CA}438}1507}1946}18}4}5/17/2010}Decibel is a deliciously cute sake bar that is underground.  Enter the place and you almost feel like you're in Asia.  The walls are covered with writing and the lanterns and decorations transform you to another place.  There is an extensive menu of sakes -- too many count and likely too many to ever taste.  We ordered the special and it was delicious enough, since I'm no sake connoisseur.  The sapporo was delicious.  I'm told that the food here is not anything to brag or even to order.  Come for the sake, come for the conversation, and come for the cool ambiance.
Peng L.}Brooklyn, NY}137}333}1136}18}2}5/8/2010}Japanese sake dive bar. Reasonable price. But I don't know whats the big deal besides its in a basement and its a dive bar. Sake is not my drink of choice but if it's yours, then you would like this place.The bathroom is right by the entrance area and smell like puke when I was there.Ran into Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Hohansson on the way out.
Nick R.}Boynton Beach, FL}8}6}3}-1}4}5/6/2010}This Sake Dungeon has all the Sake you could ever want. Great edamame. Bring a marker, pen, rock, crayon, or whatever so that you can scribble your name somewhere. Lost a star because sometimes the wait sucks and its slightly pricey. Still, its a good hang.
Jinsoo L.}Rockville, MD}127}84}2}-1}3}5/5/2010}I just don't get it.  This is what I would call one of those bars that could only really work in New York.  People here love to be pretentious and go to places that intentionally try to look ghetto since they think it adds a lot of vibe.  The place is a dump.  Chairs are uncomfortable and the shrimp crackers they serve, you can buy it at H-Mart 2 for 99 cents.I can't discount the sake.  They do have a wide variety.  But I guess I'm not a big sake connoisseur because i really think they all taste pretty much similar.  I have yet to try the food, but it was just so so to me.  The service was decent and a good place to take a tourist to be marveled at a seedy new york Japanese divish bar.  but I would skip and go somewhere else.
Liz C.}Brooklyn, NY}643}600}3}-1}3}4/21/2010}You know what I mean: this place is maaaad East Villagey. It's self-consciously cool, in a sophomoric, NYU sort of way - frivolous and a little too aesthetically-minded, but all in all, successfully achieving the artsy, cheap Nipponese chic it's gunning for. Fittingly, all the nibblers (standard izakaya fare; consult the nearest amiable Japanese person or hipster if you're unfamiliar) are nuked. You'll probably have to send your okonomiyaki back at least once, since defrosting the core of dense food matter by way of dorm-watt microwave is a tricky business, but by the time you eat it, you'll be walloped enough on sake to whoop !izaka-ya-yay mutherf*cker! on your way out the door.
Jaymee Hedge K.}New York, NY}5}37}5}-1}4}4/19/2010}this place is an awesome place to drink and hangout with your friends, very small so it's hard to get seating if you don't come early- a looot of sake- friendly staff, all japanese- the feel of an authentic izakaya- i think they played hip hop music?- loud and lively on the weekends, mostly bc its crowded in a limited space- underground so it almost feels like a hidden bar- very fun.
Kim C.}Boston, MA}119}222}0}-1}4}4/15/2010}Felt like I was in Lost in Translation! Walked down some shady stairs into this shady establishment. It was dark, kind of dirty, and had real Japanese people working behind the bars. The sake menu was pretty nuts so we asked for suggestions. Of course the dude recommends the most expensive ones on the list and of course we were suckers and listened to him anyway. Glasses were served in the box and poured to the brim (like it should be). Lively and fun and actually a really diverse crowd. Probably bad for groups because it's so small but I'd go back with a friend or date.
Jennifer Y.}New York, NY}183}611}0}-1}4}4/11/2010}The name says it all, come here for Sake!Sake galore, 4+ pages of drinks, cool, underground artistic vibe.  Authentic Japanese people run the place.My only recommendation...come here to drink and be merry with snacks on the side, don't plan a meal here with drinks as the food menu doesn't quite cut it.
Hit U.}New York, NY}1}785}0}-1}5}4/8/2010}Quite a hidden treasure. Some of the best soju and sake in a crowded basement. Order a side dish of lychee.
Gary L.}Oakland, CA}182}273}45}-1}5}4/3/2010}Divey sake bar?!  Daddy like!This is my type of sake bar.  Dark, dank and a little seedy, the vibe is one where you expect the night to end either really well or really really poorly, depending on the number of drinks that get poured.  My friend and I came on a quieter night, but there was still a good number of people.  It's a great place for good conversation over an enormous selection of sake.  And what a selection it is.  The list is extensive to say the least.  While I am by no means a sake connoisseur, I can certainly enjoy a good bottle when I come across from one, and with a list as vast as this one, there are plenty of good bottles to be had.
Miles H.}Taipei, Taiwan}51}169}0}-1}4}4/2/2010}Its not often you find a dive japanese bar in NYC, but this is what Decibel is. Its got a HUGE sake selection, not to mention plenty of whiskey, shochu, and mixed drinks. The food isn't much to speak of, but there are tons of good great food places in the area to try out.
Matt B.}New York, NY}24}52}1}-1}5}3/31/2010}dark lighting and strong drinks make it the perfect date spot
Jenny S.}San Mateo, CA}27}87}17}-1}4}3/27/2010}Swampy, dark, underground, and a japanese waitstaff with anime-hair.  I'm not exaggerating on the 'swampy' factor. I had to step over a significant puddle to get inside this basement sake bar, only to be greeted by highly humidified air inside. (my hair was screaming for me to leave). Going into this bar felt like I was heading towards my doom.All of us in my group loved the ambiance of the bar, although I wouldn't call any of us NY bar connoisseurs. We stuck to the safe drinks.. lychee martinis(delicious) and soju. They also have quite an extensive sake selection.  You probably don't want to come here with groups larger than 4-5, because you won't be able to sit at a table together.
Katherine F.}New York, NY}0}34}0}-1}3}3/21/2010}Great ambience and cool layout.  The selection of sake was amazing.  Not really a sake drinker, the rest of the selection was quite basic and light.
J Z.}New York, NY}45}86}8}-1}5}3/17/2010}A menu that describes its sake almost exclusively through oxymorons, a dizzying "I'm-edgy-but-don't-take-me-too-seriously" wallpaper, and waiting area that wraps around the entrance kitchen prep area so iconic of back-alley restaurants in Japan barely does justice to Decibel. But I will go no further, as the experiences are meant to be captured in memories, not in words. And my, were they memorable...
Jan Y.}Long Island City, NY}97}374}1307}-1}4}3/10/2010}I love this place! I love that it's underground, small, dark & filled with Sake.   They serve food here but almost everything is made out of the microwave, so I suggest get drunk here and eat elsewhere.  I would have given this place 5 stars but why are  they serving the sake in a box when the box is not made out cedar? Minus 1 star.  :o(
Jordan T.}Providence, RI}68}40}10}-1}5}3/9/2010}Domo arigato Sake Bar Decibal. Walking into SBD is like descending into the ungerground world of Tokyo. After noticing amine on constant loop in the front room, I knew I was in for an authentic experience. This is the perfect place to come to with a small group of friends looking for some sake and a good time. Grab a booth, order up some tasty and extremely cheap munchies, and get sakied up.
anthony r.}Philadelphia, PA}8}39}8}-1}5}3/5/2010}Shhh. Sake speakeasy. Great music. Seems like a good place to bring a date.
Ryan B.}Santa Monica, CA}16}79}19}-1}5}3/1/2010}Atmosphere along gives this 5 stars.Selection of Sake.The Geisha outfits, the feeling of authenticity, whether it is not, does not matter . . . when you are here - - you feel whisked away to some cellar in Japan.  All aspects nailed perfectly.  Try during the week, to have a more peaceful setting.
Mike S.}New York, NY}28}117}19}-1}4}2/20/2010}Coolest of all the St. Marks bars. Its somewhat hidden and hard to find. If you don't live in the area or go to NYU, you probably have to be told about this place or you'll walk right by it.SO much sake to choose from. Nice cocktails. Sucks how small it is though. Makes it crowded most of the time. Once you are in, its pretty sweet. The decorations are unique with the graffiti ALL over the walls and ceiling. Very Japanese. My friend and I call this place the Hatori Hanzo (yeah its pretty bad @$$). You won't feel like you're in NYC when you're here.   Don't expect to be full when you get out either. This is really all about the sake.
Patrick P.}Woodstock, VT}45}211}0}-1}4}2/20/2010}There is a lot of awesome going on at Decibel.  Specifically:- Amazing sake selection- Tasty, authentic Japanese food- Great atmosphere and "hidden" vibeThe main downside of this spot is twofold:  it's tiny, and the staff has a hard time managing to seat any party bigger than two people.  If you have more than four, you're probably better off elsewhere.
Nathan N.}Philadelphia, PA}6}60}1}-1}1}2/6/2010}Horrible and I mean horrible service.  I enjoyed the sake and the beer but it was very annoying to have to keep asking for it.  I do not think it is too much to ask for some attention when you are an enthusiastic customer.  Even minimal service would have been nice but it was nonexistent and my tip (still surprised I left one) reflected it.  I left 10% because they pretty much have to spit in my food to get nothing; we are all struggling.  One of the servers questioned the tip.I said that the service was poor and the tip reflected that.  He said that he did not understand.  I informed him that we were not shown any attention.  He still claimed he did not understand what "poor service is".  I will not be back.
S K.}San Francisco, CA}4}83}59}-1}5}2/4/2010}No amount of words can do justice to explain this random underground Japanese sake bar. Quirky, Japanese punk is as good as I can do...if you've never been to a sake bar, just ask the servers for recommendations as the sizes, prices, and tastes of each bottle varies quite a bit. They also have food on the menu, but we went for the small bites yo accompany the sake but they even have big bowls of ramen too.  Honestly, it felt like I was transported to Tokyo while I was there.
Izac H.}New York, NY}48}82}6}-1}4}2/3/2010}Dingy, dark, covered with graffiti and serving sake in a box, in some strange way this is my kind of place. Maybe it is the quirk and slightly hidden nature, this place definitely has its own weird kind of charm. I have never had sake in a box but once you get over the logistics of drinking it (tip for those as slow/inebriated as me, at some point remove the glass from the box) you will really want another one. PS It was lateI was not sobreI drank all my dates sakeOther important factors of a review (costs, food, people, music) duly forgotten.
Darwin G.}New York, NY}276}954}67}18}3}2/2/2010}I need not repeat how cool, dark, and hard to find this tiny sake bar is. Although the address is "240," that actually is an apartment. Just look next to that number and onto the basement. A bitch to spot.I never knew there could be such a variety of sakes and the menu even categorizes them into sections with specific characteristics and an explanation on what gives them that flavor.The price can range from $10-$20 for a little bottle or glass. If you enjoy sake or want to explore a hole in the wall, I would suggest Decibel.
andrew c.}Brooklyn, NY}43}77}0}-1}4}1/27/2010}How to Be "Cool"?For any establishment serving food or drink, being "Cool" in NYC these days seems to be determined by the following factors:1) How limited is your seating?2) How dark and brooding is your space?3) How far below street level are you?4) How difficult is it for people to find you? Decibel is a tiny, dark space guarded by a flaccid red rope and Mr. Facial Piercings Galore.  As the sole discrete access point, Decibel has set up a drunkard's deathtrap of an entrance with a flight of narrow cement stairs descending below 9th street. So try not to arrive completely schwasted like I have and it'll help you avoid any UDI's (Unidentified Drunken Injuries.. you know.. those bruises or injuries you find the morning after and ask yourself, "When and how the hell did I get this?")).  Decibel doesn't try as hard to be enigmatic and unseen with gimmicks such as phone booth entrances or continually changing phone numbers a la PDT and Milk & Honey, but with only a small obscure wooden sign, it doesn't exactly shout "ENTER!" to passerby's either. So overall, it meets the threshold requirements to be a "Cool" place to go.The food menu is limited and feels like more a forced gesture to offer an accompaniment to your sake than a good faith effort to serve anything delicious.  Nevertheless, mainly by virtue of the sake, you'll find yourself thoroughly enjoying the sashimi plates or edomame.  One dish that I love in and of itself is the steamed scallops - a must order during any visit.  After all's said and done, all Coolness nonsense aside, Decibel is always a fun place to drink.  But if you aren't a frequenter of NYC's "Cool" places, you'll probably feel hip here too.  Which is probably why the party seated behind us were two Oklahoman couples one could safely assume were grandparents.  Nice people.
Momo R.}San Francisco Bay Area, CA}47}227}8}-1}4}1/25/2010}A traditional izakaya in the heart of the East Village (very close to the already reviewed Cha-Am Tea House), Decibel's menu contains many varietals of sake--all accompanied by descriptions such as "sweet and dry", "crisp and flowery", and a myriad of others that are equally difficult to comprehend for an olfactorially deficient person such as myself.  In any case, if you are a fan of sake (which, I discovered during this foray that I am not), I can't see you not being pleased with the comprehensive selection and quality.  The bar itself has a cool grungy feel, which is heightened by the fact that it's a warmly lit basement below street level and the fact that your server may be bedecked with multiple elaborate piercings.  Food is also available.
Kris O.}San Francisco, CA}198}216}29}-1}5}1/23/2010}Came here twice in four days. Of course I'm a fan. Not to mention two orders of sake gets me feeling pretty happy very quickly. I have yet to go to Japan, but this is what I would imagine an authentic sake bar would feel like. They different styles of sake, chilled, warm, plum wine, sochu, martinis...so even if you don't like sake you can still enjoy a drinky drink. I would say the best time to come here is during the week.
Dililah S.}Brooklyn, NY}73}83}63}-1}4}1/17/2010}Best place hands down for sake.  The vibe is cool,  the music varies from hip hop to bjork, and decor is funky.  it's awesome for groups, and dates since i know i've done both! ha  their small plates are pretty awesome as well and everything there is worth a try.  the crowd ranges from hipster to upper east sider, but understand that this place is a must for sake so it attracts everyone.  it will quickly become your go to place.
Morgan W.}Sweden}5}16}0}-1}4}1/14/2010}Reviewer number 254. What else can I say?I just go with: You want some sake? This is the place for you.Small, cute place, with many japanese customers, which is always a good sign. Follow the locals (natives?). Why not 5 stars? Well, I was good in every way, but nothing blew me away.  I just Can't give it a 5 if it's not spectacular. They do sake, and they do it well, but aside from that... I don't know.
Jay S.}New York, NY}0}28}0}-1}4}1/11/2010}For years a bartender friend of mine told me about a sake bar that was on 10th st, and for years I kept walking past it never knowing it was there. One day I was walking back to my apartment and I noticed a small sign at the top of a stairway leading to a basement. I figured I would check it out. As I walked down the stairs and in though the door I felt like I stepped back in to this bar I use to frequent a summer abroad in Japan. I sat at the bar and had a few great glasses from their wide selection of sakes. I couldn't figure out why this place was so empty. A few days later I returned back to this place with my bartender friend and she took me to the room in the back where all the tables were and it clicked.  It is a great dark bar nice for dates or just to have a conversation with friends and have some great glasses of sake. They have food but I have been told it is not great.
B L.}Brooklyn, NY}147}106}116}-1}5}1/10/2010}Sweet place... Dark, unassuming, underground, seemingly authentic... very cool place... Great date place (I'm guessing). It's a little pricey, it's sake, but traditional and dive-like... Can't wait to go back.
anya t.}Los Angeles, CA}12}11}0}-1}5}1/8/2010}Every time I go to NYC, I never see the sunlight. Underground metro, underground restaurants, underground bars...and I am guilty of staying out too late and starting my day in the afternoon. However, last time I had a pleasant surprise in East Village...the Decibel. We had bottles of sake, cold noodles, and tuna sashimi that were bonko...whatever that is, I just made it up. Anyways, if I ever go to Japan...like the hippest city Okinawa...I would expect places like the Decibel. End of discussion.
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}5}1/7/2010}When you are out looking for something different than the norm, you should give this place a try. Sakis in all different flavors and styles. Hot or Cold,  etc etc. Each has a distinct taste and special name for their drinks. I like to bring my dates here. Its quiet, and you can hear yourself think unlike most bars. They also have small appetizers here if you are craving a snack.
Courtney ..}McAllen, TX}676}77}6}-1}5}1/7/2010}Oh god. This place is as badass as it gets. Just don't expect to hear a damn thing your date is saying. Feel sexy & sway to the sake, underground red light & tight, evocative corners.
julia r.}Brooklyn, NY}81}358}0}-1}4}1/4/2010}a recipe for decibel's success: pour together satisfying and tasty, gently fold in obscurity, add a dash of strange and sprinkle kitsch on top. serve with sake and discover unending appeal
Jordan H.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}5}27}1}-1}2}1/2/2010}As far as Sake Selection- this is second best in Manhattan.  However, if you are willing to spend twice the amount on sake and put up with waiters who question you on how much you tip- then by all means go to Sake Bar Decibel.  This bar is overpriced, over-hyped, and the bartenders expect the most even though their service is less than average.  There are 4 sake bars in Manhattan that are way better than this place.  Satsko, Sakagura, and Sake Hana run circles around this place.  GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH WAITERS QUESTIONING YOU ABOUT YOUR TIP AND AVERAGE SERVICE.
Bonnie C.}New York, NY}112}152}0}-1}5}12/21/2009}decibel's the perfect little hideaway for a good convo or phenomenal sake tasting.  their selection is huge!  best to go for a one on one or small group given the petite size of east village real estate.small plates are great bar food, not a full izakaya
Bert N.}New York, NY}102}253}0}-1}5}12/19/2009}My two liquors of choice -- sake and cognac.  I have yet to find a good cognac bar, but here I have finally found a great sake bar.  A small intimate setting which is full of character.  Many different selections of sake.  I like that they explain the flavors and texture of the various sakes in their menu.  The appetizers were pretty good as well.  I had the pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and the hamachi sashimi.  Pork dumplings were really interesting because there was a kick of wasabi.  Intense, but good.
Phil L.}Ottawa, Canada}5}13}0}-1}4}12/18/2009}iPhone's Urban Daddy recommended this place near where we were having beers at Swift.  Good thing we had the address number or else we might have missed it.  I was all giddy climbing down the stairs just imagining what we would find down below.  Authentic looking Tokyo sake bar!  Very cool atmosphere and decor.  The staff were helpful (unlike some previous reviews) although the place wasn't packed.  My friend ordered a beer and I ordered cold sake in a box.  We ordered a few dishes which were fine but nothing to write home (or yelp) about.This may be a good place to bring a date in the future...
Mia M.}Graz, Austria}25}121}36}-1}4}12/17/2009}Rich and mellow, light and crisp, or maxin and relaxin? so many types of sake to choose from. had a good time trying to figure out if the descriptions were dead on, or just b.s. In the end, it didn't really matter. blink and you'll miss this place. downstairs, it's a dark, dingy, and mysterious sake dungeon playing, curiously enough, house music. i do plan on taking out of town guests here.
Eileen Anne F.}Brooklyn, NY}130}60}0}-1}5}12/6/2009}Wasabi pork dumplings are my prescription---screw Sudafed, this is THE powerhouse decongestant.  No sake bombs here, but you can improvise!
David H.}Chula Vista, CA}23}42}0}-1}5}12/3/2009}Hard to find but well worth it once you do.  This place feels decidedly authentic --- offers great reasonably priced sake -- and has a hipster vibe that just works.  Definitely coming back.
Molly M.}Los Angeles, CA}15}112}0}-1}4}11/24/2009}This was a neat place, a crowded place, and a hidden place.I only drank and hung out but I enjoyed the scene and the "underground" vibe.  A cool spot to go with some people (not too many!) before going out.  Hidden down a stairway, the only awkward part is milling around on the sidewalk asking strangers where to enter.
Kouichi K.}New York, NY}12}116}0}-1}3}11/9/2009}I'm a horrible Japanese person.  I really don't like sake.  That said a few of my friends and I go here often.  You can definitely miss this place as you go down the stairs into this small run down hole in the wall.  The sake menu is extensive and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.  The space is small and the place can get really loud.  If you are a sake lover, you should try Deciibel.
Mukur H.}Centreville, VA}49}177}331}-1}5}11/2/2009}If you can find it.. go! ;) This place hit the spot perfectly, the atmosphere was top notch. I missed the little izakayas and bars in Japan and this brought me right back. Their sake selection is great, the staff very knowledgeable, and the space extremely tight. Located in a basement with an unassumingly small sign, this Japanese bar is wonderful. Since there were 5 of us and we got there around 8:30 we had to wait for a seat. After about 30 minutes we were guided to a small stall in a dimly red lit room. We had an awesome time since the company was good and the tables around us had quite a bit to drink and were happ'ly loud. I will be back when I am in NYC.
Vincent K.}Emeryville, CA}419}813}70}-1}5}11/2/2009}The biggest difference with SF and NYC is the definition of hole in the wall places, and certainly this place makes the even smallest hole in the wall in sf nothing.  This place is almost unnoticeable as you go down the steep stairs and enter the world of sake heaven.  Immediately upon entering, you'll notice to the right wall upside down sake bottles with taps.  that's when you know they're serious about sake.Came here with a bunch of friends and friends of friends, to enjoy the good company and our night in NYC before heading out to DC.It reminds me of a Sake version of Monk's Kettle in SF, but underground and dimmer lighting.  So which one did we get?Kenbishi - Rich and Mature - why not?  we're none of those?, might as well drink some and become so
Pree R.}New York, NY}12}96}0}-1}5}10/31/2009}Like a tiny slice of Tokyo, Decibel could easily make you forget you're in an East Village basement -- if not for the other gaiijin there:).  Tasty food (try the wasabi dumplings for a little kick) and a great sake selection are paired with a serene, straight-from-Japan interior, and completed by an all-Japanese waitstaff.  The key with Decibel is to either go early or on a slower night (i.e. not the weekend) -- ideally both.  Good spot to enjoy a (semi-)quiet conversation on the right night but even better for a small group.  And a nice warm sake on a cold winter's day...speaks for itself.
Ishmael V.}Brooklyn, NY}222}226}34}-1}2}10/27/2009}I had heard all the great reviews about Bar Decibel (at least according to Yelp, because I rarely look elsewhere for recommendations, nothing really wrong with that). While living in Japan I may be a little snobbish or even a little arrogant in my standards. When everyone states this is EXACTLY like a Japanese "speakeasy"--remember that the Japanese didn't go through the prohibition era, and them trying to make it a speakeasy is just them being assholes and trying to have some crowd control over the situation. Touching again on the speakeasy situation and how hard it was to find something and that you went through a stairwell and that it wasn't marked--just means that you haven't been to Japan and don't know that a lot of shit isn't marked. That's part of the beauty. Space is key and a lot of kick-ass places have unmarked doors, some are in office buildings, others are in department stores, and even some are through kitchens under the subway station.Let's talk about when you fist get there. They make you wait in a 4x4 enclosed pig-pen-like area where they can call that "they" have a table ready for you, and you can be happy that it took, oh, 30 minutes for 2 of you to get in on a Friday. Again to this Japanese standard that I have...99% of places in Japan the service industry is immaculate. The customer is ALWAYS right. People are "honored" that you came to their establishment.Not here. These Japanese folks are pissed and weathered with the NYC attitude (and I understand they use it as a survival mechanism--if you don't you get eaten alive)--but seriously get over it! Go back to the way "authentic" shop keeper's customs are in Japan. Greet and at least give me that "authentic" (fake but respectable) smile you offer to all your guest when they come in, even when you are packed and serving a bunch of "white" devils. Now once you've sat down and have the "honor" to sit in THEIR establishment, you are seated with no menu (at least in our case) and waiters that look like they came from the pits of Tokyo (content.mthai.com/upload…). This guy didn't have orange hair, but still would be outcast from any sub-culture in Tokyo. Once I place my order with the aforementioned waiter (karage/fried chicken & yakisoba/fried noodles) I also place my order of shochu. On highlight is that they are not kidding you that they are are a sake (nihonshu) bar--their list is extensive and a little intimidating. Just a little FYI, sake (nihonshu) is an old person's drink that is rarely drunk by young trendy individuals in Japan, most drink beer or shochu. Sake was an export that was exploited and now is the drink that is associated most with Japan.Anyway, once our food (or lack there-of) came, I was surprised at what was dished out onto our plates. The karage were just a couple of microwaved soggy pieces of unknown meat (maybe chicken) and was full of nasty fat. Not crispy and delicious pieces of fired chicken that I am know to order...hm. The yakisoba was okay, but you can just go next door to Otafuku and get a better order for less money (god am I an idiot!).Those were my biggest gripes, but I don't know if I will go here again. It just seems like an izakaya that is sooooo run down and still damn expensive. There were izakayas that were comparable to this in Harajuku that had $1.50 beers and I dealt with the grunginess and how busy it was because of price. This place is not that. It pretends its a bad-ass Japanese punk izakaya, but fails to deliver.
Thirsty Pig ..}Los Angeles, CA}314}165}180}-1}4}10/27/2009}This place is small and hard to find.  There is no ventilation and it is a big stuffy.  There was a long wait to finally get a table.  It was loud and tough to hear your friends talk.  The tables were crowded and stools were too close to everyone else.  But I choose to give it 4 stars.  I liked the place.  It's one of the few places I would return to, when I go back to NYC.This place, and the total experience, is festive environment.  The people, the crowded space, and most of all the sake.  This crazy joint packs it in with people waiting outside.  With the staff welcoming people, screaming orders, and having a great time, this ties in with a, supposedly, typical neighborhood bar you'd find in Japan.  They have a great selection of sake with some Japanese bar & drinking food.  Its a not a place to bring a first date, but cool place to bring a small group of friends.  I'd suggest to get there early on weekends.
Chris C.}Manhattan, NY}42}133}107}-1}3}10/18/2009Updatedreview}Having been completely stoked with my last experience, I was excited to bring on more people on to stoked train.  We went around 8 pm on a saturday night... yes we get the drinking on a bit early.  We didn't have to wait too long.  For a party of three, we were seated in a two seat table (the same one I sat last week, weird how that happens sometimes).  Let me just say, it is a very limited space... there's barely any room to put our jackets, scarves and purses without squeezing it behind your butt and having basically two inches of actual sitting space.  With limited space for your butt from the purses and limited arm space from the people sitting next to you... life was really not too comfy.We ordered the sweet and bubbly bottle of sake.  This tasted like a mixture of champagne and sake, it was a different experience drinking carbonated sake.  But this different experience really wasn't worth it for 350 ml bottle for $51 (btw 350ml is not big at all.. enough for 3 glasses).  After being disappointed with the outcome we decided to try out the other cheaper bottles something a bit worth our dollars.  We got the very thick and deep (haha), it's one of the milky and sweeter sakes.  It's pretty strong, not as sweet as I thought it would be.  My favorite out of the night was the sweet and crisp, it's a cold clear sake.  I thought it had a good balance of sweetness to it. The food (sweet potato, fried chicken and even dollar shrimp chips!)  was an excellent compliment to all the drinks.  I don't think I would come here for a weekend night, way too crowded. Second time around was a bit of was a bit of a downer from the overly crowded bar.
Cindy C.}New York, NY}78}287}0}-1}3}10/18/2009}I was excited to try this place, especially since Chris C had a great time here. After an early dinner (well, early for new yorkers.....you guys eat so late!) we headed over to this little hole in the wall, very discreet little bar tucked away in the east village. Since we were early, there was virtually no wait and we escorted to our tiny tiny corner within minutes.The selection is huge, and they have some descriptions to help you decide if youre not too sake savvy. My gripe with the menu is that it's not terribly organized....and I felt sort of betrayed when I realized that we had ordered a bottle for $51 ..and it was a 350ml bottle. Of course, bottle size is written in fine print in the last column. So watch out for that. The sake selection is vast, and the food (shrimp chips, fried chicken and sweet potato) are the perfect compliment when drinking sake - But, seriously, organize the menu a little better and try not to cram 6 people in a 2 person table...just because it was a corner table doesn't mean that seats will magically expand.
Jeff A.}San Francisco, CA}69}80}0}-1}5}10/15/2009}Izakaya style? A Japanese speakeasy?  All I know is that I want the Sake Bar in SF.  The Sake Bar has become our decompression spot after days of long meetings and unfortunately, this can become a problem especially when you're trying to catch the first flight out the next morning.  The food is good, (typical Japanese bar food) but the sake and the overall atmosphere is what makes this place great.  Look forward to returning and will plan ahead by scheduling a much later flight!
Robbie T.}Queens, NY}200}1}0}-1}2}10/9/2009}I had a terrible experience at this restaurant last night. Two friends and I were squeezed into a table for two when the restaurant was still half empty and we then ordered some drinks and appetizers. I ordered the Hamashi and Wasabi Shumai, while my friends ordered some fish and a Japanese pancake. First to come out was the soy sauce for my Shumai. Then the fish (I forget what exactly, as it wasn't mine) and then the pancake. I sat patiently watching my friends eat, insisting I wouldn't share since I had my own food coming.20 minutes later my friends were done eating, and when they were ready to order more appetizers and drinks I had to tell the polite waitress with bangs that my food never came. She was confused and asked me a few times what was going on, and apologized (she may had said something about someone being on vacation in the kitchen, but I wasn't sure as it was loud). Eventually my Hamachi came out (which was fresh and delicious) after my friends' second order had already arrived. The waitress asked about my dumplings, and I told her with a smile that they still haven't come and she ran off behind me. Then my friends finished their 2nd order, and she asked again, "no, still haven't!"An hour later, and I never saw that waitress again. So I told a male waiter to give us the check but to make sure the dumplings were not on it because they never came, and he turned around when I was still completing my sentence and left.Eventually he came back out with a lady with a short bob, she pointed at my place setting and said "I put your dumplings RIGHT THERE" basically accusing me of lying. All three of us (all Asian, by the way) know what Shumai looks like, but they assumed we didn't and ate it without realizing. I said "no, you put the sauce down first" as I pointed to the unused soy sauce bowl "and then the fish, and then the pancake and then nothing else came. The other waitress even asked me several times if my dumplings ever came, where is she?" and they ran off mid sentence again.As we waited for the check, the male waiter threw a plate of dumplings in my face and I sighed with an "omg" that they were actually finally arriving one hour later."No, these are for another table. These didn't come?" As if I don't know what Shumai looks like! My mom makes them from scratch, for crying out loud. We emphatically said "NO, THEY NEVER CAME," as our calm patience had worn very thin.Eventually another polite waitress, this time with long hair and no bangs, gave us a check with the Shumai whited out, bowing and saying "sorry, sorry." Her apologies were as if she had nothing to do with the male waiter and the woman with the short bob who angrily insinuated we had lied about the Shumai never coming.As I was leaving I saw the Wasabi Shumai being passed to several other customers. Would it have been that difficult to just give me six little dumplings that I ordered an hour ago without question? There was clearly an abundance.Needless to say, despite the quality sake and tasty food (from what little I had) I will not be going back to Decibel. I do have mixed feelings, as two of the waitresses were quite nice about the situation, but how can I forget being so rudely treated by the others?
Kevin G.}Brooklyn, NY}36}131}0}-1}2}10/5/2009}I want to like this place, but it's disappointing. It looks a lot more promising from the outside (good looking sign, discreet subterranean entrance) than it does when you're actually seated and examining the (sort of expensive) menu. They have a nice sake selection, but the izekaya-style food is average at best, and pretty pricey. The music is terrible, and (true to the name, I guess) too loud. They'll serve sake in masa if that's your thing, but they use the cheap lacquered kind in lieu of fragrant wood -- what's the point? Overall I think if you want this kind of experience there are a half dozen better places downtown and in Brooklyn, even in midtown (Sakagura).
Mark B.}San Francisco, CA}129}412}291}-1}4}10/2/2009}Go to Decibel! Down the stairs you go, until you break the curtain entrance and are enfolded within the glorious gentle arms of a hundred fermented rice wines !   My faves are too numerous to count but I recommend the lovely effervescent version of the liquid. Had a blast and will return. Save the drunken debauchery for the tequila bar episode and come here for a rice night out with friends
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}5}9/22/2009}I love this place on a weekday, It's less crowded, less waiting and better service. Sake is the ultimate thing to get and it seems like you are in a underground outdoor back alley in the middle of Japan within NYC! It's surely unique.It's a little surprising cause you don't quite know what you'll see when you enter downstairs and then you get greeted by the most peculiar Japanese host with an earring connected by a chain to his nose ring while his long black hair falls on his shoulder.  :0
Nicole C.}New York, NY}125}299}3}-1}4}9/21/2009}Really small and intimate, I love the space, love that it's kind of hidden, have to go downstairs. The service was okay, it seemed like they were trying to rush us into ordering food, and tried a few times to take away our menus even though we were still deciding on food. The sake list- quite extensive, with descriptions of what they taste like, many different cocktails, Japanese beer. Impressive, really impressive. The food- the scallops were interesting, I liked the sauce though the scallops themselves were not served cut and clean like they usually are, they had the tentacles and everything! Slightly scary to look at, but pretty good to eat. I wanna say we had the bonito sashimi- it was very meaty, different. Came with a garlicky paste. It was pretty good though I did not see how the garlic had anything to do with the fish. We had these little rice balls- they were okay, not bad. The udon- now I am not usually a udon fan, I really dislike the consistency of the fat noodles. But this, this was extraordinary. They were so perfectly made and cooked. YUM! I really can't stress enough how cool and unique the decor and ambiance is. Unlike anything I've ever seen. I've never been to Japan, but I imagine this place was pretty authentic. I'd definitely come back to try some of the more unique items in the menu. My dining partner was not the most adventurous eater. Really cool space, and decently priced.
Dinelle L.}San Rafael, CA}95}27}9}-1}4}9/20/2009}Decibel is one of those "only in NYC" joints that makes you feel instantly hip and urban the moment you descend down the hidden staircase. It feels like a Sake Speakeasy-password required. You are instantly bummed you're not at least pretend Japanese-like a random girl who works there...The staff are all painfully hip and according to my Japanese friends, the environment closely mimics sake bars in Japan. Their sake selection is crazy extensive-I suggest just taking a shot in the dark and seeing what happens. I love the kimoto sake, its complex and rich. Many of the cocktails are clever and not too sweet. The food is minimal as their kitchen is open and tiny, but I highly recommend the Bonito and the uber spicy shu mai. Be ready to wait a while if you head here late on a weekend. Also, don't be surprised if you see a celeb or two sipping shochu in the dim lighting and adding graffiti to the walls.
Peggy P.}New York, NY}256}92}4}-1}5}9/17/2009}Really small, but really intimate.  I loved it.  It was my first time there so I didn't know what to expect but I definitely read up on the reviews on here and knew I needed to check it out.  It was a good thing that it was just me and my boyfriend cause it looked like a place that would be great for a date or a very small group of good friends.  The music was very soothing and the place was very dim, I felt it was very relaxing and it put me in a very good mood.We were lost in the menu so we both just chose something that we thought we'd like in a sake.  I ordered the Genbei San and I really liked it!  Really smooth and not bitter.  I definitely want to try all the others on the menu, too, in the future.I would recommend you show up early, like around 9pm, which is what we did.  When we left around 10p there were a lot of ppl waiting around near the entrance to be seated.  As the other reviews have said, it is a very popular place and I can see why people would call it their favorite bar to hit up.
Miette S.}Santa Rosa, CA}263}26}15}-1}4}9/15/2009}The last night I spent in NY on my last visit, a few of us went to Decibel. It was totally the right spot to go to on the last night of a New York vacation. It is a subterranean Japanese restaurant in the East Village with walls you can write on and good, albiet loud, music. We shared several bottles of sake and had a smattering of delicious things to eat. The octopus probably ranked the highest--slippery little suckers that tasted like heaven.The ambiance alone was not what made the place. It really delivered on the food.We ate scrumptious dumplings and cold tofu. The tofu had this delectable sauce made from (I think) ponzu, wasabi and green onion. Yummers. I wrote one of my favorite Nicole Krauss quotes on the wall. I photographed myself in the bathroom and got quite tipsy.I would recommend this spot for a date. But the three of us really had a great time.
Rebecca F.}Honolulu, HI}36}40}6}-1}5}9/12/2009}I hesitate to write about this place because I love it so much; in fact, it's my favorite bar in Manhattan. There's a great sake list (by the glass and bottle), and the prices are really reasonable. The food is typical izakaya food (unagi, okonomiyaki, shrimp chips, edamame, etc), and in addition to sake the drink list also includes shochu, wine, and beer. The space-- with dark wood, interesting fixtures and low light-- is cool and always makes me forget I'm not in Japan. What's most fun is all the things that customers have written on the walls. I've spent hours exploring the cartoons, song lyrics and late-night confessions. This place feels lived in, which gives off the impression that one is being invited in to something special. I love this place. It can get really crowded, but there are lots of seats and they try to accommodate. It's also open till 2:50am, which is very nice. (Note: there is an $8/person min, though this shouldn't be too hard to meet, considering the wealth of menu options.)
Alison C.}Hoboken, NJ}1023}1360}529}18}4}9/8/2009}Hidden down beneath the Japanese-restaurant adorned 9th Street, with merely a small plaque to attract attention, Sake Bar Decibel provides a truly unique and intimate experience for those in-the-know.  Descend the narrow staircase to find yourself in a sushi bar.  No patrons are seated in the immediate area and the pathway is blocked off by a fraying velvet robe.  Inquire about a table and you will hopefully be granted access to the neighboring room.  The dining room is small and fills up quickly, so try to arrive as early as possible to snag one of the tightly placed tables.  The walls are coated with heavy black graffiti, which, when coupled with the dim lighting, make you feel as if you are in some scummy biker bar...in a good way, of course!  The beverage list is full of sake selections that are segmented by dryness, taste, and so on.  The detailed descriptions are much appreciated, as they eliminate the confusion of ordering.  However, you are still left with the agonizing decision of which version with which to proceed.  I recommend splurging on the variety labeled as "The Best Sake of 2009", which is sweet and extremely smooth.  The food menu is not as substantial, but does offer some terrific items.  The two large cubes of Chilled Tofu ("Yakko") are topped with crispy bonito flakes, ginger peels, and scallion slices.  These seasonings add the perfect amount of flavor and varying texture the dish needs.  The Takowasa are gooey raw strands of octopus that remind me of soggy bean sprouts.  They are swimming in a light wasabi sauce that provides just enough of a kick without being overpowering.  The Yellowtail Sashimi is extremely fresh and some of the best I have tasted.  Each slice is skillfully sliced to the perfect portion.  The Steamed Scallop small plate is glazed by a delicate garlic soy sauce.  The scallop is juicy and perfectly cooked.  The Karaage dish includes several fried chicken nuggets that have been tossed in a savory barbecue-style sauce.  The Baked Rice Balls ("Yakionigiri") and slow, sweet cooked fish ("Shishamo Kanroni") are also enjoyable.  Lastly, the shrimp chips are a fun addition with their crisp, airy texture making them similar to shrimp cheese puffs.While Sake Bar Decibel is known for its cocktails and dungeon-esque feel, the fact that they serve some terrific food is an added bonus.  This is one hidden gem definitely worth visiting.
Kiki J.}Atlanta, GA}56}255}2}-1}4}9/8/2009}One of the reasons I love NYC so much is that you constantly feel like you are traveling to foreign countries, but then you get to sleep in your own bed at night.Walking into this sake bar is like instantly being in Japan.  I loved the decor, the selection, and the table service.  The crowd was lively and fun, but it is also an intimate spot to take a date.  I want to come back and try to food and more sakes.
Stefanie W.}New York, NY}16}24}1}-1}4}8/28/2009}Attention Men Looking for a Date Spot- this one's for you.Thinking of taking a special lady to Decibel? Allow me to provide you with some basic steps to help your night seamlessly segue into breakfast the next day.Step 1- Look cool. Unbutton the button down and slip on something that won't make you stick out like a roasted pig in a synagogue. The wait staff is impossibly hip, as are most of the patrons. The joint is subterranean, and Japanese, after allStep 2- The sake menu is expansive, but you really can't go wrong with anything under the Junmai category. So tell your date that. Literally say, all nonchalant of course, "Well, we really can't go wrong with anything under the Junmai category, which I prefer chilled. Sound good to you?"Extra points for you, sir! Oh and after eating, say, "Have you tried unfiltered sake? They have this sake called Crazy Milk that is perfect after a meal. It was served to samurais over 12 centuries ago." (This is all true by the way.) She will then think you are a bad ass for knowing about samurai warriors, and will feel more comfortable with getting all crazy since you said it was ok to drink the crazy milk. (It's light, sweet and, in reality, not very bad ass which is why the back story is so key.)Step 3- food! If you are adventurous, go for the raw octopus in wasabi sauce. Not so much your thing? The karaage, or Japanese fried chicken, is off the hizzy. Their sashimi is fresh, the udon is solid fare, and the dumplings and scallop dish are good too. And lastly, do not try to say anything to lead her to believe that you somehow discovered this place because, well, it was featured on Gossip Girl a few seasons ago which means the cat's outta the bag. Instead, say, "Did you know that this place was featured on Gossip Girl? I think Chuck Bass came here or something. I'm so glad it's still pretty cool and not flooded with 16 year olds." She will be most impressed with this, especially since most guys think "Chuck Bass" refers to throwing fish.
Jonathan W.}San Francisco, CA}136}97}1}-1}4}8/9/2009}Though I've never been to Japan, stepping down into this place makes you feel like you're entering a new world.When I walked in was promptly seated and was impressed by the amount of Sake and Shochu Decibel offered.  I tried Shochu for the first time, one distilled from Sesame.  It had a nutty flavor and I enjoyed.  Ordered a few food items, standard edamame and seaweed in vinegar.  They were okay, nothing fantastic.The people that work here are very prompt and were friendly.  Decibel is a spot to go when you're looking for sway away from the typical bar scene.  When you've found a good place, the writing's on the wall...literally, at this spot.
Jacob L.}San Francisco, CA}17}169}0}-1}4}8/2/2009}Great sake selection, interesting looking place, feels very Tokyo. The downside is that they really pack 'em in to the small space. If you're a party of 3, and you come when they're crowded, you'll probably all have to huddle around a tiny table and at least one of you will be on a little stool. The food is also only so-so. But really, you come here for the sake so that's not a big problem.Open late. Great place to take a date, especially if she's never been there before.
Shonda M.}Palm Springs, CA}32}82}36}-1}5}7/30/2009}ultra cool ambiance, open late, delicious Japanese tasty treats and nice variety of sake.  love it, love it, love it!
Mimi F.}New York, NY}1}14}0}-1}4}7/24/2009}OMG! All of them remind me when I was in Japan like "IZAKAYA style" People are very nice but you should be there earlier. They are occupied soon.
Michael F.}Astoria, NY}34}61}6}-1}5}7/19/2009}This place is rated so hi for good reason! The first time I came here i was pretty drunk and it took me and my friends a few min to find this joint but once found, it was worth walking into every store to ask directions. Tucked away this place has a strong following and if you make it down here you will see why. Great place to get together with friends and chip in on a stellar bottle of Sake and order some side dishes (cheap and O' so good!). I haven't been here for a little while and as I'm writing this it just makes me want to make the trip. The decor seems authentic and the staff is speedy and friendly but not all up in your grill. For sure a place you can lean back, talk, nibble, and drink the night away
Laura A.}Brooklyn, NY}234}342}1228}-1}4}7/15/2009}Covert and cozy; overt and crowded. Really cool. You can impress your date if she/he is fascinated with japanese style. But, be watchful first time you go there, otherwise you'll miss the place since the entrance is not noticeable. "Rules": wait in the line until someone notice you and allow them follow the protocol which includes count your #pple, check out your IDs, take notes and makes you wait. Once they have a table in the back room, which you have barely noticed, they open the rope (yeah there is a rope, so cool) ... follow them to your table and enjoy! I love this part, first time when you don't know whats going on, I was fascinated. the staff is very very nice and kindly.... and so respectful that you inmediatly can't be other way. They also provided help for novel sake drinkers.  But coming into real bussiness. SAKE... the selection is huge. Huge man!! and I love they describe each one with 3-4 adjectives which for novel consumers (as me) is really helpful. You will need this. And it's also best way to remember that one which you loved so much. Decibel is my Sake College. They also have some food to grab but I can't say a word (Check my update soon!)Final tips,-for small groups. -a date ambience..yes and yes. Love that soft candle lights.

Christina M.}New York, NY}302}483}51}-1}5}7/1/2009}When I first moved back to NY after college someone took me on a date here and I thought it was the coolest place ever.  Though I may have been naive, I still recommend you take another naive girl here on a date and she will be impressed.  However, I gave this advice to my friend on match and he was a little annoyed because I guess if you order a bunch of tapas (dinner isn't really available) it gets to be a bit expensive.  Which brings us to another point:  Bring your date here to DRINK ... sake.  It feels super cool to like go down the dank staircase to a little wooden door (without a sign) and walk into this alternate Japanese universe where people have cool haircuts and such... but again, this is a wide-eyed 22 year old talking and I'll never be able to wipe that experience away and start fresh.  And who would want to really?
Anna T.}Brooklyn, NY}69}70}10}-1}4}6/29/2009}Decibel is another bar where it's easy to walk by and not realize you just passed by. It's right off the Max Brenner chocolate place, marked only by a small placard, leading down a flight of metal steps. You step in, and at first impression, it looks like the bar is merely the five or six seats at the foyer. But no, the host will lead you down a small hallway where there's a bigger room in the back, all filled with people drinking bottles and small casks of sake.The price of the sake isn't cheap, but their selection is immense. I don't think the servers will really help you out in choosing what's good, but heck, I think everything pretty good here anyway. It's a place where experimenting with various types of drinks is not a bad thing.The Bofyriend tried the Bloody Marikko, which is a bloody mary with shochu. God, that thing was dangerous. I couldn't taste the booze in it all, it was that smooth.
Victor T.}Austin, TX}24}225}62}-1}2}6/22/2009}My gf raved about the 'coolness' of this place, but meh, it was alright. We sat shoulder to shoulder with a full house in the back room. The music alternated between cool and cheesy, and forget it if you want to be intelligibly heard two bar stools over (3 in our party).We ordered some Unagi and Hamachi sashimi, and had the wasabi shumi too. The latter packed a WALLOP. Depending on where you bite in the shumi you either get no wasabi, or you get a punch in the throat and nostrils. We were joking about the Heimlich sign in front of us, but two of us nearly needed it. The Hamachi was decent, but the Unagi was hardly tender, which surprised me.Our friend had two $18 glasses of sake while I settled on beer.This place does have a certain grotto feel to it, but the service (couldn't tell who our waitress was) and food were a let down.Go there once just to check it out, but really, it could have been so much more.
Jeremy K.}San Francisco, CA}6}26}0}-1}5}6/22/2009}One of my favorite places to catch up with friends. The setting is opium den sheik and you can write you name on the wall which is always fun. The sake and shochu is awesome, though some of the mixed drinks can be disappointing.
Leighann F.}New York, NY}3233}961}695}-1}4}6/15/2009}A dive bar. With sake?Brilliant.Though I was living in New York (Queens) when Decibel opened so long ago, my first visit took place at the beginning of June. Years later, with 200 reviews, it's nice to see the concept caught on with the New York Crowd.No, they will not seat you unless everyone is present. But the noise level rumors and shushing and general attitude of solemnity wasn't as exaggerated as I'd heard. We laughed, we talked, sometimes over each other. But when my friend swung the anchor hanging down in the middile of our table, one of the servers did come over and promptly stop it with a firm hand and a tight-lipped stare of disapproval. "Sorry kids, no clowning around here."Being new and inexperienced with Sake, this is the prime place to get acquainted. Order a box and try a few different styles, snack on some edammame. And as Ilker O. says, "Please, don't take your bridges and tunnels, highlights and juicy couture here." This is definitely a place to commiserate and appreciate.
Nina B.}Alexandria, VA}45}404}10}-1}4}6/13/2009}A little hidden away, and definitely a bit dingy.  Which I wasn't expecting, but I liked the charm of it. The staff were friendly, and helpful in providing recommendations, but I can't help but question their knowledge, especially when they say out of a list of 100s of Sakes, they don't have a single one from Kyoto.  I was told that the best sake comes from Kyoto (of course, every city I visited in Japan claimed they made the best sake).  A bit pricey, at $8-$16 dollars per glass, but definitely worth it for the experience.
Chris W.}Boston, MA}65}249}20}-1}4}6/5/2009}On trek through nyc with a good friend I was led on foot to a destination kept secret. After walking an unknown number of blocks we dipped down the stairs into a dimly lit room. My friend asked if they had a table for two. I stood there looking around at the small entrance room breathing slowly, waiting, watching. We were led under a rope into the bar room. The cool room gave off warm vibes with minimal lighting. The grungy walls were covered in do-it-yourself writing leading my eyes and mind on stories in all different directions. An order of wasabi dumplings and box of Bishonen Sake was ordered and arrived with out much delay. The lack of space was overlooked by the tasty treats and flavorful sake. Something about this place tells me I should only bring my truest of friends and those worthy of knowing such a hidden gem.
Christine F.}New York, NY}11}79}0}-1}1}5/21/2009}I usually don't like to write scathing reviews of anywhere - but tonight I had an extremely disappointing experience at Sake Bar Decibel in the East Village.It was most disappointing because it was a bar that I have been going to for the past 6 years and constantly recommend to friends and visitors.I had started noticing over the past two years that ever since the bar has gained more mainstream popularity, the service started to become more and more erratic and just down right rude.It is almost as though they do not know how to manage their tables in slow times as well as during the busy hours.Tonight I brought two friends from out of town to Decibel for drinks. As a party of 3 we were immediately shown a tiny table for 2 and told to squeeze in - even though there were 2 sets of tables for 4 available.We moved over to one of the tables and were promptly told that we should be ready to be asked to move if the bar got busy. Given it was a slow night, this seemed unnecessarily rude.Not a great way to start off the night. Decibel has pretty low prices so between the 3 of us we ended up ordering about $19 worth - and were told the minimum/person was $8. If the minimum is $8/person, why would you price any drink under that $8 ceiling? Just irritating.We told the waitress we would add to our order after we finished our first round. For the next hour - the waitress not once came back to ask if we wanted anything else.Finally, jet-lag had set in for my dining companions and we were ready to leave. Again, we asked for our check 3 times and finally just left $24 = $8 x 3 people.We were chased out of the bar and told we needed to add on $2 for tax. So our bill was $26, even though we ordered $19 worth. And after we were then asked for a tip. All I can say is ?!??!We were asked to tip on top of the $7 extra we had already paid for non-existent service. The only reason we were not able to reach the minimum $8/person was because our waitress disappeared for an hour and no one came to take our orders.They wanted a 20% tip on top of the $26 dollars. That would mean paying approximately $31 dollars for a $19 bill.We were told we were no longer welcome there when we only gave $26. That's fine by me - I certainly wasn't planning on returning anyway.
Helena Z.}Brooklyn, NY}48}264}0}-1}5}5/15/2009}One of my favorites. Sake, shochu, cocktails, snacks in a cozy underground bar. Great for a chill drink with a small group.
Jen V.}New York, NY}36}68}3}-1}3}5/1/2009}hidden gem. down the stairs. forty-five minutes. small space.  rubbing elbows.  loud but intimate. conversations. rambunctious laughter. first dates. sake flowing. red glow. dim lanterns. sultry ambiance. so sex. bathroom walls, anonymous confessions, bring a pen. lychee on toothpicks. warm dumplings. sake flows. and flows some more. hits you faster than a domo arigato, mr. roboto konnichiwa sashimi harajuku tokidoki naruto cowboy bebop wasabi tsunami.
Kat H.}Brooklyn, NY}126}165}23}-1}3}4/28/2009}I don't understand this place at all. And neither, apparently, do the waitresses. After ordering a $113 bottle of sake, my professor asked for wooden boxes instead of glasses and was met with the same blank stare he was given when asking about the largest bottle size. It got to the point where we wondered if she was just another customer we mistook for one of their waitresses. And then, after a half-hour of cheesy lounge music: "What the...no way...are they playing The Weather Report?!" (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We…) And then: "Is this Massive Atta--OH MY GOD. THIS IS PRODIGY." Then the table of Asian bros next to you starts loudly singing along to "Smack My Bitch Up" and you're full-tilt disoriented.In situations like these, it pays to just keep your eyes on the prize aka your very expensive box o'liquor and stay cool. Hopefully you're not paying for it either...
Madhuri I.}New York, NY}290}272}0}-1}4}4/26/2009}There's something wonderfully cute about a underground Japanese sake bar with polite hardcore punk-haired bartenders, hidden under a nondescript Japanese sign in the little Tokyo of NYC.I will say little more. You've got to see the place for yourself. Be prepared for a little wait. Be prepared to see the widest selection of sake in the city. Be prepared to be a little surprised by the prices. Splurge and you won't be disappointed.I'm soooooo coming back. Shh.
B P.}Brooklyn, NY}6}24}0}-1}5}4/20/2009}If something like 190 other people hadn't already rated this place, I'd avoid doing so- there are too many people who love this place already and I don't need any more competition for a table.  Go away!That said, this is probably one of my favorite places in New York.  Walk down the steep stairs (the one with the little lit-up sign, not the one next to that, which leads to you a locked door where all the patrons watch you try to open it, look confused, try again, and go back up the stairs) and get out your ID.  They'll ask for it at the wee little rope.  If you are early, before 9 or so, you will likely be seated but come in a small group, 4 max.  Past 9 the waits are reasonable, mostly, but there will be a wait.Per decor, think punk/hardcore sake bar- lots of graffiti on all the walls, dusty old sake bottles and maneki neko, and just a general air of a Tokyo drinking club for metalhead sake freaks.  Ideal.The sake menu is extensive, and they pour generously, but it's rather easy to blow $80 without noticing it in like an hour and a half so take care.  Try Mu if you aren't a big sake fan- one of their best priced for the value sakes, very floral and smooth.  Good snacks but certainly not a dinner destination.  I tend to stick with the $1 shrimp chips, but have had a lot of the small plates and all are acceptable to good.  The staff are all straight out of Central Casting 'Cool Japanese Youth' catalog, and that's a good thing- they are very fun and have better haircuts than you, but will still help you select a great sake for your tastes.  The music is a big draw as well- I've heard everything from jazz to black metal to early punk to broadway musical scores here.  Check it out, or even better, don't- I want your table.
Catherine L.}San Francisco, CA}55}145}21}-1}4}4/19/2009}I'm more familiar with the soju bars in K-town but this place does justice to the hobby of sake indulgence. Huge, descriptive sake menu. Great place to chillout with friends due to the low noise level and sufficient lighting.Cozy, relaxed, slightly grimy cavern feel. You have to go down steps to get to it and it feels like u're in a cave.I can't comment extensively on the food but the apps are economical and tasty - small but only $4/$5 each.
Judy L.}San Francisco, CA}371}889}9}-1}5}4/16/2009}Sake in a box. Sake in a bottle. Yuzu sake. Sake samplers. Lots of sake.Go downstairs and drink.
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}4/12/2009}This place gets four stars, despite the fact that sake and I have decided that we have irreconcilable differences. I got back from a short stint in Tokyo not too long ago and hidden underground joints like this, made me miss Japan. The place is Japanese-run, and the service also seemed more Japanese in that they keep their interactions minimal. Cute decor, datey, or good with fun friends. The sake we wanted was out of stock, so a random bottle of nigori was ordered in its place. The description was thick, pinkish, milky, etc. I haven't had sake properly before this, and absolutely hated it. But I don't like to waste so we decided to down the rest as shot. The second bottle was 'normal' and what I expected sake to be like. But, I couldn't enjoy it properly because I couldn't get the first bottle's thick taste out of my head and it'd improperly welded with the burger I had earlier from The Smith. Can sake be described as meaty? If I ever came back again, I'd order food and sparkling sake or shochu.
J C.}New York, NY}93}42}26}-1}4}4/9/2009}great chill vibe to go kick it with a few friends. menu is small, and wouldnt recommend anything but the variation of sake is great. place is very dark so its ok to bring 6's.
Sean S.}Manhattan, NY}743}1655}34}18}4}4/8/2009}Walk down 9th street and you'll find tons of Japanese restaurants and bars.  It's like little tokyo in the East Village.  Just West of Max Brenner you'll find a tiny sign, and a stairwell leading to a basement.  Walk through the door, and you're transported into a little den of Japanese sake goodness.  Of course you'll also find beer, and a small menu of food, but this place is obviously known for it's sake, and there are pages of options to choose from.  I'd recommend asking the waiter, since I'm not sake guru.  But the place is great, very secluded, and special.  A good date spot I'd say too.Also keep in mind if you didn't notice on the menu, there's an $8 minimum per person, so don't go for just one round.  It's pretty easy to get over the $8 minimum though, but just in case...
T T.}New York, NY}1}3}0}-1}2}4/6/2009}I have been going to this small underground bar for the past several years because of its cool intimate atmosphere and wide array of sake, but NO MORE- WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! We were constantly searching for waitstaff to ask for more drinks and waited twenty minutes for the check. Accordingly we did not leave more than 15% after which our server came over and asked about the tip. After indicating that we didn't really feel like discussing it, he told us that "15% is unacceptable" He then followed us to the door and asked if we had forgotten to leave a cash tip- REALLY? We had to explain to him that bad service= bad tip. If you don't like being bullied into leaving a big tip, you might want to have your sake elsewhere!
Annabelle B.}Boston, MA}169}124}0}-1}4}4/2/2009}Love this place. Cool environment and it's a good place to start, or end, your night. It's dark and cozy. It's got a nice grungy feel, you can tell this place has been around. A good place to sip your sake slowly and have a long conversation with someone whose company you prefer. They have a huge selection.  It makes me want to learn more about sake! But whatever you do, don't order the cheapest one- I don't care if it's a recession. I made that mistake once and it was seriously awful!  I've only had a couple appetizers here, this place is definitely more about the drinks.
beverly c.}New York, NY}12}126}22}-1}5}3/30/2009}my kind of dirty little place..not for everyone, cramped and grungy but i wouldn't have it any other way. good music, service, recommendations by staff. authentic sake, authentic feel. great place for that right kind of friend to bring and just sit and chill. please, if you're from out of town or want to bring out of towners here, don't expect 5 star hospitality. it is cramped and "dirty". don't complain that it "smells"....it is a BAR. please, don't take your bridges and tunnels, highlights and juicy couture here. thanks. we appreciate it.
Alex C.}San Francisco, CA}108}168}243}-1}4}3/26/2009}probably my most frequented place in NY so far.   if you like sake, you can't miss this place. well, actually, you'll probably miss it the first time you walk by.  look for a narrow stairway heading down to a basement they have a small sign that says decibel.  i love the graffiti drawings on the wall and the ambiance of the whole place. the sake is great and the food is pretty good.  their sashimi is fresh and the cold soba is pretty good. cool place to bring a date.  this place gets crowded and tables can be really close to each other, but i have yet had to wait to be seated.  oh yah, remember your IDs.
Christina C.}New York, NY}294}100}7}-1}4}3/22/2009}First rule of Decibel is you don't talk about Decibel. Fight Club meets Sake Bar on 9th Street that was well hidden down a flight of stairs and would never have been able to find if it weren't for my date.Once we were allowed past the rope, we were led through a sketchy hallway to a small room and were seated.  We ordered a bunch of apps and I was pleasantly surprised by the food ( even though the Wasabe brought tears to my eyes). Sevice was stellar as well!Defintiely a good place for a date or to bring a small group of out of towners for a unique NY experience. Will definintely be returning.
s f.}Los Angeles, CA}16}34}4}-1}5}3/22/2009}Decibel is not just my favorite sake bar, it's my favorite bar in NYC, period! (It probably helps that sake doesn't saddle me with the nasty hangover I get when I overdo it with beer or other kindsa liquor. Hats off to my partial Japanese heritage for that.)No matter how crowded Decibel gets at peak times (e.g. weekend nights), its out of the way location and cozy/gritty atmosphere always make me feel like I've discovered a hidden gem tucked away on a subterranean level of Stuyvesant St. Not an inaccurate description really...Decibel offers a great selection of sake (by the bottle or glass), and plenty of other alcoholic options if you aren't the biggest sake fan. I've sampled a few different unfiltered sakes and haven't been disappointed yet.***BONUS: What's NOT to love about a bar where you can get a bowl of lychee (served in a tiny bowl, over ice) as a side? It's a delightful, sweet, and delicious compliment to my sake every time!!!P.S. Please pronounce it correctly, folks. It's sah-keh NOT sah-key! (Sake NOT saki.) Thanks. :)
Jamie S.}Philadelphia, PA}169}473}169}18}3}3/3/2009}The first time I stumbled in here was on an outing with the family- it was not really the place for us but I vowed to come back. When I finally gathered friends and made it past the rope, I definitely liked the purposely sketchy setting and it more than impressed my friends.  It didn't seem to be a place for eating, so we just snacked on edamame (which I absolutely HATE ordering at restaurants because its so damn cheap  to just make at home)I enjoy sake and I know which descriptions sound better to me, so I appreciated the narratives on the sake menu that led us to good choices. That being said, it could get pricey and would best serve as a stop over for one drink type of place- as long as you meet the $8/p person minimum.
Isabel L.}New York, NY}257}406}91}-1}3}3/2/2009}Good selection of sake but I wouldnt come here for a full course meal since their menu selection is limited and consists mostly small dishes to go with the sakeI like the hidden, down-in-the-basement element of this place. The tables are super intimate and the sake prices aren't too steep. Its a good place for some good conversations.i did, however, get slammed when the intoxicated me accidently  tipped half of what i should have tipped ( it was one of those 3am, could no longer do basic 3rd grade math moments) Basically the bill was 80, and instead of tipping my usual 20 percent tip, i gave them 10 percent. Now the waiters made sure i knew about my mistake, and came back at me in the most upfront manner.Perhaps it was the language barrier, he came up and said " this is NOT enough tip". a bit surprised, i looked at the bill and realized how little i tipped, i tipped him a good 23% so he would leave me at peace.So my thought is, usually Japanese restaurant s are good with customer service and are pretty cordial about reminding a customer on the tips but in this situation i felt like the tipped was  almost demanded. Couldn't they have nicely asked if there was something wrong with the service instead to start off? That was a little scratch on my impression for this place that i always liked.  O well, better luck next timeGood for : small group hang out                   post dinner spotsNot good for: Dinner                        Large groups that just wants to sake bomb
Grace A.}Brooklyn, NY}24}63}1}-1}4}2/25/2009}I really liked this place once I found it after three trips up and down the block. It's underground and really comfy inside. The waitstaff was very laid back and let us linger for hours, though we went on a weeknight which I hear is MUCH less crowded than the weekends. I have pretty much no knowledge of sake but the menu was huge with a brief description of each drink next to it, so that definitely helped.The food menu was a little stingy, so I would eat before coming here, though the Japanese pancake ($8) was really good for a snack. I would definitely come back.
Megan C.}Rockaway Park, Queens, NY}122}175}38}-1}4}2/12/2009}Stepping down into this tiny, confined space gives you the illusion you're no longer in New York, making it a charming place to have an intimate conversation. Of course, all the cons of a tiny, busy confined space are there as well. It took 3 visits till I finally get to sit and enjoy some sake.
Alan N.}Morristown, NJ}81}334}8}-1}3}2/9/2009}ok ok everyone settle down. most people know far and wide in NYC and especially the EV that decibel is the best sake bar. They say celebs go there, they say the best sushi chefs from japan go there. but i will tell you this, go there if you want to experience the den, the cavern, and the darkness that is the basement bar of decibel. if you go on a weekend it will be cramped. But i ask you this: are you a sake expert? if you aren't there are a lot of other places to go that are more fun, and maybe, not as hidden, but more fun. See, Decibel has a long list of sake and shochu cocktails but the food is just not good. if you want to a good combo of sake and food i would suggest oh taisho, there is more light there. i dont know much about sake, but i do know that i probably wouldn't be able to taste the difference between a $38 bottle and a $108 bottle, which are about the lowest and highest prices listed on the menu. on friday night i went, got a $45 bottle and some apps (fried chicken and dried squid) both were not at good as taisho or sake bar satsko. I am glad to say i went, but there are better, especially in the EV.
Diane C.}Hoboken, NJ}247}530}7}-1}5}2/7/2009}My fave sake bar!  Even without the added "coolness" factor of being underground and tucked away - it's vast selection would be enough to give it my #1.  On weeknights, the place is comfy and relaxed.  The back room can be a romantic setting for a date or a great spot for a get together.  On weekends - it gets pretty insanely packed and the wait can get ridiculous.My fave drink is the Indigo Sochu cocktail.  SO delicious.  Boo about the $8 per person minimum but a drink and some edamame pretty much takes care of that.
Beverly H.}Sunnyvale, CA}114}39}21}-1}5}2/2/2009}this is the first place i think to take my ny guests to start the night off right. it never fails to entertain visitors with it's cozy japanese hole in the wall mystery. if the seating was cozier and a lil less crowded, this would be my home away from home. And like so many ny gems, there's only room for so many patrons to stand inside the tiny corridor and wait for seating. *no wait list, just be patient, or go elsewhere
Mariana C.}New York, NY}77}66}0}-1}4}1/28/2009}What I should tell you: Teeny, tiny, dark, cramped! Don't go!What I will tell you: Teeny, tiny, dark, cramped! Go!
Elisabeth A.}Agawam, MA}57}198}1}-1}5}1/24/2009}Loved it! Freezing, and crocodile lounge had a wait to get inside... so we came here. I really liked how cramped and cozy  and dark it was, great environment! It's crowded... but you all get seats. I don't care how close I am to the person next to me, at least I'm not standing at a bar with even more people pressed up against me! :P I wasn't in the mood for sake (which I've never tasted actually... someday. I've just started really drinking alcohol finally...) Actually got a beer... which I used to hate, but now am starting to enjoy! Yay! took long enough. Anyway... Sapporo for $5, not bad. We also had some delicious edamame beans and fresh lychee. Mmmm...Anyway it was a good time. It wasn't too loud and we could comfortably  converse. Only had to wait 10 minutes for our seats on a Friday night. Just a great time overall.
Catita D.}New York, NY}77}38}0}-1}4}1/22/2009}One of my favorite NYC bars. The cons are that it's cramped and bad for crowds, and bad for anyone not willing to linger for the slow service.Pricey as well, but not so much as it's sibling Sakagura.
Marcus V.}New York, NY}6}17}0}-1}4}1/20/2009}sake and eda mame for days son.
Sara W.}San Francisco, CA}44}417}8}-1}4}1/19/2009}This place is great. Hidden, dark, delicious...when you walk in you feel like you've found an underground portal to Japan. The only reason it's not getting five stars is that sometimes the service is wayyyy toooo slowww.
Jah M.}New York, NY}15}11}0}-1}4}1/18/2009}small, but slice of sake heaven. great atmosphere ... can get crowded, so off hours rock, sake and nibbles are quite tasty.
elise h.}New York, NY}52}235}6}-1}3}1/15/2009}I'd never been to Decibel until a recent Sunday night.  But now I know that it's an excellent place for sake lovers or those who just want to try something different.  We showed up at about 11 and the place was pretty chill -- even though most of the tables were taken.  The outside entrance and stairs make the place seem like it's going to be fancier than it really is, but once inside, you can see that it's a funky East Village Japanese place, like all the other Japanese places in the East Village are.  There is a tiny room up front where employees greet you and get you menus, and then you are led to the back room which has plenty of tables, low lighting and graffiti-covered walls.  It's a very, very casual place (kind of like a combination Japanese restaurant/dive bar) but the vibe is very calm.  I found the clientele to be animated but not annoying, even though tables are small and close together.  The service was great and yes, there are lots and lots of sakes to choose from.  Me and my date got away with a bill just over $20 and we each had our own little mini-bottles of hot sake.  Even if you are an idiot about sake, you should visit Decibel.  The waitress could tell from my questions that I know nothing about sake and she was very helpful in asking me what my tastes were (sweet or not sweet? mellow or strong? etc.) so that she could recommend a couple of sakes to me.  We stayed a while and got deep into conversation, and it was a very nice place to pass the time.I will return to have some more sake and try the food -- it looked good!  And I loved the odd edgy-but-mellow ambience of the place -- definitely different than a lot of EV bars and a good one to put into the rotation if you're frequently out and about in this neighborhood.
Trogdor B.}San Luis Obispo, CA}21}265}1}-1}3}1/12/2009}huge sake selection, for sure, but you pay the price. we had two bottles of sake, two beers, and a wasabi shumai, and we paid $120. good, comfortable atmosphere, too.the wasabi shumai is good and their Asahi was really good...which makes no sense, cuz it's the same bottle as every other Asahi i've ever had, so perhaps it was just the fact that it wasn't a $60 bottle of sake.
Manuel d.}Woodside, NY}250}14}1}-1}4}1/12/2009}I just went for my second time tonight, and found this place to be just a great little intimate spot. Go during the week or early on the weekends to avoid the sometimes-45min wait. Their Sake selections are bountiful and the appetizers are tasty. Their specialty sakes are particular and tasty, as well as their mixed drinks. Don't go in a large group, and if you want bring a pen so you can leave your mark amongst the many, many people who tagged up the bathroom and booths ;-)
Matt S.}Brooklyn, NY}2}34}0}-1}4}1/1/2009}Great place to go for Sake.  Close tables make for interesting conversation and love the location.One of my favorite last stops before home.
Sheena B.}Brooklyn, NY}192}152}6}-1}4}12/30/2008}Years ago we used to have to ring the buzzer to get in, but they loosened up & the place got really packed. But hey, don't let that stop you. They'll stick you in there, somewhere.Dark sake dive bar with graffiti all over the walls, japanese staff, japanese soups for cold winter nights, excellent cocktails, and sake of all calibers. I like to get hot sake with an orange peel. It's not their best, but it's affordable & I like it. Do expect to lose a huge chunk of your wallet here! I highly recommend bringing a more "serious date" here as sake has the tendency to get people a bit emotional & it's nice to find out just what you're dealing with. I know, sneaky, but it's smart. I do like their lychee martini's, but they're sweet & potent, so look out!
Nik C.}New York, NY}4}13}2}-1}4}12/27/2008}The first time I came here was about 4-5 years ago and I was back last night. It's probably the 5th or 6th time I've been there in that span of time. This place hasn't failed me yet. It's the kind of bar I like - laid back, cramped hole-in-the-wall feel (yes I liked cramped spaces), good selection of alcohol (sake in this case) and just generally unpretentious. It's like a cute and cozy dive bar.....if that can even make sense. There's graffiti all over, but its underground location, the tight seated quarters and general vibe, creates an atmosphere that lends itself to more intimate conversation.I've taken dates here, close buddies, friends. The food is decent but not their shining point. My only complaint is that the foyer/alcove entrance stinks of some fishy/salty smell. I remember that stink from the first time I've came here years ago and it's amazingly still there. Incredibly, that funky smell does not waft into the back room - which is where your really want to be seated anyway.(Speaking of that back room, It was a surprise to me when I first came here ages ago - and it usually gets an "oh cool" from your out of town friends) I also noticed they made the place a bit "brighter" but that might just be me- I think they should have stuck with the darker vibe.Overall a good spot to chill out. Barring any drops in quality, should be a staple go-to for me, for years to come.
George L.}New York, NY}82}135}0}-1}4}12/21/2008}I went here twice so far.  I feel like when you go down the steps if feels like it's truly a underground in the know place, or atleast thats what I say to myself and friends when i take them there ;p.  ANyway It's very cramped... and sometimes the bathroom smells and when your waiting on the small lines it kinda sucks...  It's fairly dark but it sets the atmosphere and also everything has a very grunge authentic feel to it.  The waiters and waitresses are very knowledgeable. Very interesting sake's and the list is very very large!I said it was cramp before but somehow it works and your not on top of anyone.  and it makes it for a nice cozy feel.  Great for the winter imo.  The service is decent, considering how many people they fit and the limited pathways to walk, not bad.   I just really love how everything about this place has authentic feel of Japan.  =D
Jay S.}Jersey City, NJ}7}3}0}-1}4}12/16/2008}When I walked down the stairwell into this place I felt as if I was about to walk in on a circle of people betting on a cockfight, but to my disappointment there was none...They do however have a great sake menu and a good food menu, no full meals but that's not what you go there for.  You go for the sake martinis, the ebi shumai dumplings and the genuine japanese feel of the place.
Laur T.}New York, NY}26}780}0}-1}4}12/13/2008}3.5 stars.First time I came, we sat at the bar and kinda felt weird hanging there with the dudes at the bar. Little did we know that there are many more table seatings further inside :)Good food menu. My friends and I like the lychee, zaru soba, okonomiyaki etc. when we come here. Especially love the prawn crakers that they provide as opposed to the regular chips. Ahhhh, very japanese indeed.
Lainy C.}Los Angeles, CA}128}605}5}18}4}12/2/2008}Great place to chill with friends, grab a few bites and drink. The lychee martinis are strong but tasty and they have an enormous list of sakes, shochus, etc. The food is a bit overpriced with small portions. This is a place to get some nibbles but not a real meal. I think most of the menu comes from Sunrise Mart across the street but its still tasty.It has an authentic underground sake bar feel to it, and the service is quite friendly.
Romy V.}Hawthorne, NJ}29}45}0}-1}3}12/1/2008}Haven't eaten here in a while, but I don't go for the food.  Decibel is the perfect place to get sloshed on great sake by candlelight and engage in provocative conversation, especially since it is so loud talking is best done while leaning in over the tiny tables til your head almost touches your date's.  You know where this night is going.Choose your drinking partner wisely.
Thierry S.}New York, NY}25}141}0}-1}4}11/30/2008}A trip down into this hidden labyrinth always feels like an escape from the world outside. I love sitting in every dark corner or at the bar.  The sake, shochu, and drink list is impressive and the staff is more than willing to explain and make suggestions.  The menu has expended and now offers good, if standard, Japanese bar food.  The shumai and fried vegetable pancakes (Okonomiyaki) now add to the reasons to make the decent.... as if anyone needed any more reasons.
Elizabeth B.}Washington, DC}9}81}1}-1}5}11/26/2008}Magic. Loved it. Go. ps. do not cheat yourself by sitting at the exterior bar. Wait for a table in the back room, it's worth it.
Sam C.}Toronto, Canada}71}69}12}-1}4}11/23/2008}Was in NYC for a weekend and wanted to get out to explore, other Yelpers would agree that your first time here you could easily walk by and miss it. However we were on a mission to find this spot. We showed up around 11PM, thinking it would be packed and may have to go somewhere else. But it took like 5 minutes to get a table. The sake selection is the best I've ever seen, decor and atmosphere is VERY cool. Think Japanese meets Irish bar. The only complaint I have about this place, the Izakaya, is not that great. Dishes are small and no where near the Izakaya standards you would be accustomed to say in California.
Monica C.}Emeryville, CA}49}21}0}-1}5}11/21/2008}I am a regular at Decibel so obviously I love it there. The drinks are strong (especially the Lychee Martini), and taste like candy! Mmmm...I like going on days that aren't busy because it can get cramped real fast. Fridays and Saturdays are the worst. And the Green Tea Rice dish is delicious!
Margie C.}Brooklyn, NY}47}29}0}-1}5}11/13/2008}The mark of a great dive is how much you miss it when you don't go for a while. This place is just the right mix of dirt and sophistication. Great Sake selection, nice bartenders, and the whole place feels like a secret Japanese basement. One of my favorite spots in the East Village.
Andrew D.}Brooklyn, NY}780}582}227}18}4}10/30/2008}I have been here many times and each time I remember how much I like this place.  I was here last Saturday during the rain and it was so cozy.  We had shochu cocktails.  I recommend the Linn which is like a lychee martini.  I also recommend the fried chicken and okonomiyaki.  Great place for a drink date since the lighting is so flattering.  I'll keep coming back here forever.
Shoshana S.}Bronx, NY}48}23}7}-1}4}10/29/2008}Only way to describe Decibel is: a damn good dive sake bar. I went there last night with a couple of friends for an after dinner drink. The place is small and dimly lit. The décor is of a Japanese rural bar you'd see in a Toshiro Mifune movie a la Yojimbo with a twist: pic of Mt. Fuji and framed ink drawings hang on graphitized walls.  The music playing goes from the beats of Fat Jon to tracks that are more club dance to Brazilian jazz. Personally, I love the juxtaposition of it all. The sakes are of good quality, which you can buy by the glass or bottle. For those that know sake, Decibel serves daiginjo and ginjo.  For people who don't know sake, the top sake rating is junmai daiginjo followed by daiginjo and ginjo. Trust me, enjoying a glass of daiginjo or ginjo sake is worth the trip. One negative about this place is that Decibel lives up to its name:  you need to raise your voice for your companions to hear you thanks to our fellow patrons and the music.
Jamie T.}San Jose, CA}99}51}4}-1}4}10/13/2008}The place is a little hard to find because there's a small sign outside that only leads you to a stairwell down. Upon walking through the door, you automatically get a feel that this place is tiny.  There's a cramped bar on the right side with sake bottles hanging on tap.  To get seating at a table, the waiters take you to the back where it only gets more cramped.  Not an ideal place for the claustrophobics.  We got seated at a corner of the room, with stools as seats and a table barely big enough to fit 2 menus.  Despite the crowded atmosphere, it was cozy and fun.  The walls are covered with graffiti, giving it an urban feel.  Wait service is pretty terrible.  We had to ask several times for our food and drinks and the waitress forgot to put in one of our orders.
Jason M.}New York, NY}648}23}4}-1}3}10/10/2008}Decibel is great the first couple times you go, then it becomes the place you take your japanese out of town friends for a drink.  which is what i did.They loved it (but remember, it was the first time they had been there!)so just remember, only go there your first time....or the magic will be lost.Best bet-- decibel for a drink, then sapporo east for some grub. that place r0x
shawna s.}New York, NY}8}5}0}-1}2}9/24/2008}in short: cute place, poor math skills, atrocious customer service, and begginging for money on the curbdecibel is a romantic, appropriate first-date place even if you don't like sake as guests can share appetizers and plum wine. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. an arbitrary minimum exists at $8 a whether using cash or credit. i was reminded 4 times that i must spend $8 and i did spending $11. my guest, however, thought he had spent $8 when his beer was actually $7. woops. i had 4 different people approach are table speaking too quickly to comprehend rambling on about food. put it plainly, they forgot the order - i had to remind 2 people. we left a $20 and had the HOST FOLLOW US OUT "INQUIRING" ABOUT THE SERVICE PROBLEM BECAUSE HE CLAIMED WE LEFT TOO LITTLE TIP. newsflash: 3 drinks = $3, and $3 is 18%. and, get off the damn curb, back in your restaurant, and stop begging for money. thanks.
Cindy D.}Chicago, IL}87}403}1}-1}4}9/21/2008}I've never ever been to a sake bar before and this is something we are definately missing in Chicago!  Went with my college gfs and ordered a bottle of unfiltered sake - around $45 for the bottle.  YUMMY!!!  Also, it's pretty packed place but we were able to get a table within 15 minutes.
Lauren H.}Brooklyn, NY}42}128}45}-1}5}9/21/2008}I love Decibel. I was taken here on a date with a Korean guy a little while back who knows his sake (and Soju, but that's a story for another time) and I wasn't disappointed. I had never realized that I had frequently walked by this place numerous times, so when I went down those stairs it was like, "holy crap!". After a quick ID check we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. I can't recall what kind of Sake we drank, all I know is that we shared a a bottle, and I loved it. The waitstaff was really friendly and knowledgeable, as well as good-looking, and that's always a plus right?I had also had a Lychee Martini which was a bit strong but definitely tasty, and some of the delicious Takowasa and the Tofu salad. Best thing about sake is that I had NO hangover the next day! I'm definitely taking my friend who has a newly found love of sake to Decibel!
Rene V.}San Francisco, CA}0}28}1}-1}2}9/21/2008}This little dungeon full of graffiti in the East Village has a respectable choice of sakes, but lacks any other amenities I associate with Japan (free tea or towels). Not bad if you arrive in the right company, otherwise quite a forgetful place.
Chester N.}Redwood City, CA}128}66}7}-1}4}9/20/2008}Really wish I knew my sake. This place has the longest list of sake choices I've ever seen in the states. The two that we tried were tasty, and the food we ordered was generally good. Hamachi sashimi tasted fresh, unagi was awesome, soba was good, karaage was mediocre. However, I'll admit we were still hungry after and as there aren't that many food choices on the menu, we proceeded to Typhoon to fill ourselves up with more Japanese food, of slightly less quality and more quantity.Definitely a hidden spot, which I either was too drunk or retarded to find the staircase down to.
Lianne Z.}New York, NY}336}279}5}-1}4}9/10/2008}A friend recommended this place and we decided to check it out pre-dinner.We almost missed it because it is tucked away underground.After walking down some shady looking cement stairs we entered a tiny and I  mean TINY alcove area with a small bar and some curtains.Is this it?!We were asked for ID and led through a doorway into a larger room.POOF.This little sake bar is fantastic!The waiters are well-versed on their sake and are extremely helpful and honest. They have various sizes that accommodates to large or small parties.The ones that we tried were both delicious (tall blue and green bottles are all I can tell you, unfortunately).We didn't eat the food, just had some edamame.I really felt like I was in some exclusive (not in terms of trendy, just secretive) little sake bar somewhere in Japan.My favorite part was the "Pour your heart out" graffiti wall in the bathroom. My friend and I were in there for about twenty minutes just feeding off other people's secrets. What is it about a dirty little bathroom that makes you want to bare it all (ha, no pun intended).Now I'm sure you're probably wondering why I was in a one-room BR with someone else...but maybe that story's on the wall as well. ;)
Abigail M.}Brooklyn, NY}155}230}5}-1}2}9/3/2008}Perhaps if I liked sake this would have been a better bar for me. I ended up having their equivalent of a vodka-cranberry, with their vodka-type liquor (I don't drink vodka anymore),  which was innocuous. I couldn't taste any liquor at all which either meant it was very well mixed or very weak.I found the below street-level entry, stop at the front room with a rope, a little pretentious. I felt they were trying to make me feel "cool" and I just felt bored. My companion for the evening said the review mentioned a "Blade Runner" type atmosphere. Um? Not so much. It looked like a dingy bar.Maybe it's just that I'm not into this type of thing. Maybe I'm inexperienced in sake bars and therefore am way out of whack.
Dario B.}San Francisco, CA}179}464}5}-1}5}8/21/2008}Watch in order Akira (tinyurl.com/35vfzu) and Cowboy Bebop (tinyurl.com/7b6ps) then find Decibel and feel the wonder.
Salome H.}Brooklyn, NY}6}68}0}-1}5}8/18/2008}this subterranean sake den seems like a murikami-ish portal to another place.  i love sitting in the booths, but you need at least four people to sit there.  the sake menu is bewildering to me- so many choices.  sometimes i just pick one that has a name i like, or ask the wait staff.  yummy snacks- lotus root salad goes well with the sake.
Kent S.}Irvine, CA}128}247}40}18}3}8/11/2008}Saturday 9pm, 2 pplReally cool location. You see this wooden sign with stylish font and you know it's on like DK. You walk downstairs and I seriously felt like I was in Japan. Was just waiting for Lil Bow Wow to show up. And if you get that joke, sorry you had to watch that movie as well.Inside is really sweet with sake bottles everywhere, Japanese servers wearing robes with holes in them, and a very "Ehhh whatever" kind of attitude. But not in a bad way I'm just saying they're super chill peoples.I had a couple warm flasks of the Urakasumi. That was real nice and smooth with the kind of sake flavor I like. Paired it with some edamame and all was good. Then I ordered the scallops in garlic soy sauce.Worst. Idea. Ever. When I've had scallops, they only came with the small, fleshy white disc we all know and love. Here, they come complete with all the other connective...goodies. I was sooooo turned off by that. It looked like I had some underwater spiral demon in my chopsticks. Had a bite and the flavor just wasn't doing it for me. Other than the scallop, I'll be back for some good sake and cool vibes.
Tiffany M.}San Francisco, CA}60}374}9}-1}4}8/11/2008}Oh Brother Grant. How you impress me so.My older sibling introduced me to Sake Bar Decibel several years back and ever since visiting, I've been itching to go back.Sake Bar Decibel is unlike any other bar I've been to. It's this word of mouth place that serves sake in the basement of a sushi joint. It's definitely cozy, but you really don't mind when you see how much unique charm it has. The walls have all sorts of scribble on them, plus tons of Japanese writing on little pieces of paper. There's also sake bottles that line the display shelves as well. When I had visited at the time, I remember ordering their Lychee Martini (i know, i know. Shame on me.) while my bro went w/ a selection from their sake list. Since its been so long, I honestly can't recall how good the drinks were, but all I really can remember is cool this spot was. I love how it creates the feeling that you're transported to a hole-in-the-wall in Japan! I'll make it back one day, that's for sure.Sidenote: They're cash only.
Stephanie W.}Brooklyn, NY}681}672}54}-1}5}8/9/2008}I'd been hearing the raves about the "best sake bar" in NYC for months and months.  It was his favorite (and only) bar that he frequented while living in the city. Living up to it's much-hyped reputation, Decibel was BEYOND perfection.  Small, but in a non-claustrophobic kinda way.Lots of cute Japanese boys and girls (and one white guy, who put me to shame by knowing more about the Japanese language and culture than yours truly). A truly incredible selection of premium sakes that range in price from $5 to $45 per glass. Add to all of that, a dimly lit, fabulously dive bar-ish feel and you've got yourself the coolest underground sake bar in the tri-state area.They have an assortment of Izakaya style foods to munch on while you drink. Yummy. I will be back. And seriously? I really am going to move to NYC. This trip has sold me.
michael c.}Palo Alto, CA}22}56}0}-1}4}8/8/2008}This is a sweet little basement izakaya in the deepest, darkest heart of the east village.  Walking down the steps and into the bar, you get the distinct feeling you've walked into the wrong place.  Walls are filled with handwritten graffiti in English and Japanese and everything seems careworn. This feeling fades quickly though as you are seated and shown menus.  The sake list is 2 pages and features bottles and glasses in all price ranges and styles.  There is food here, but the bulk of it appears to be traditional light Japanese bar food that commonly accompanies sake.  All in all the experiences is a very pleasant one.  The close tables often make for shared conversations between tables and even shared drinks and food with new friends. Overall the atmosphere is extremely friendly.The only down side I've found is that the service and knowledge of the staff can be inconsistent.  I've had amazing service from very knowledgeable staff and poor service from less knowledgeable staff within the same visit.  While this was somewhat frustrating, I think this could be taken care of by more frequent visits and ordering more from the sake "geeks" among the servers.
AJ K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}28}0}-1}5}8/7/2008}My review for Decibel is long overdue, I almost feel I don't need to write one because of how damn good this place is, but I will do it anyway, keeping it short and sweet. (as much as possible)Decibel is my favorite sake establishment at the moment. Its somehow cozy and cramped at the same time, and feels like a big secret if you've never been there. But I assure you, this is no secret, and you should absolutely be prepared to wait a long time during the peak hours of the evening/night. I have never been to japan, but I felt that this must be what it would be like to walk into a Tokyo basement bar, and I mean that in best way possible. I just immediately wished I could speak japanese. Everybody there was having so much fun, it was loud, but appropriate, and I just wished I could be on the same level as the many asian patrons in the place. Decibel is so good that it makes me yearn for a life of japanese existence. The sake selection is absolutely amazing, and only a few spots, like sakagura, offer better selection. There were many unpasteurized sakes, or namazakes, available, and they were oh-so-good. I loved the Rihaku and the Otuoko namas. Also notable was a ceadar-aged sake, which, much like wine, was not as pure with the flavor of wood walking on the flavor of sake. But as it opened up with air and time, the flavors melted together and evolved, making this a beautiful pairing with my green tea over rice. Which brings me to the food. Awesome. One thing to skip - fried stuff. I think its microwaved because it wasn't so crisp. But everything else was TOP NOTCH. Just absolutely top notch for what this place is. Great sashimi, soba noodles, green tea over rice, etc. Obviously decibel is not aiming to be a fancy spot, and I am always surprised at how well they handle the food situation here. My advice? Roll up at midnight or a little before for a quick late night bottle of sake and some sashimi. You won't regret it. And if you're lucky. you might just forget where you are - don't be too shocked when you realize after walking out the door that you are still on east 9th street in NYC - unfortunately you were only dreaming of japan...
Juston P.}New York, NY}31}167}2}-1}5}8/2/2008}Imagine crawling into a tiny cave that happens to be overflowing with beautiful sake bottles, odd masks, worn wood, and flickering candles.  Japanese and English mix into a din that conjures Blade Runner.  The man behind the bar deliberately overflows your glass and the runoff collects in a box.You're free to drink from that box once your glass has been emptied.You smack a $10 down, slightly woozy from the generously poured delicious drink, and that includes tip.How much more of a 5 star experience can there be?
Erika P.}New York, NY}23}167}0}-1}5}8/2/2008}jesus this place is cool.It's quasi-hidden, like sakagura, and is this perfect, slightly musky cave-world. Extensive menu, good portions, and good prices. And really f*ing cool.
Susan T.}New York, NY}64}48}2}-1}4}8/2/2008}One really cold wintry night, my friends took me to this shady underground Japanese hole in the wall. But I love my sake! This bar has a really good selection and hot sake really hit the spot. It's really dark like a cave and seating is limited, it lends to the mysterious feel of the place but the bar food is pretty decent and sake is excellent. I would definitely go back again on some random cold night.
kathleen c.}New York, NY}187}402}0}-1}5}7/26/2008}what an awesome hole in the wall!  my friend had randomly turned into this shady, narrow staircase, which led me to decibel, and completely reminded me of the izakayas i loved when i went to japan.  it was super crowded on a friday night, but we only waited about 5 minutes. we got seated at the bar and it was hilarious watching the waiters and bartenders interact with each other.  for the most part everyone was either  japanese or at least spoke it.  an amazing selection of sake (pronounced sah-keh) from all over the country.  i convinced my friends to drink an entire bottle (they were huge bottles) of akita sake (it was quite smooth and very tasty) while i sipped on the quintessential japanese chick drink--umeshu with soda.  we also ordered shrimp chips and a bowl of lychee which paired well.  it was a perfect place to end up drinking after dinner.  the atmosphere was super fun and it was hopping.
alexandra f.}New York, NY}62}158}8}-1}4}7/14/2008}I went to decibel with a big group of friends a little while ago and I have to say it really made my night. The cool thing about this place is that you really can't find it unless you know the exact address. You feel pretty special when you finally get it and it feels as if you've been transported to an underground Japanese hotspot.Sake was delicious. Tequila shots were awesome (They bring you a plate of salt and limes per tequila shot!) We must have ordered 10 plates of edamame which are great drinking munchies.I can't wait to go back!
Aaron N.}New York, NY}87}19}0}-1}2}7/2/2008}Yeah, this place was ok.  The decor was pretty cool and reminded me a lot of the izakayas I used to frequent in Tokyo.  The food on the other hand....my god  I can't believe I actually ate what they served me.  Most of the food tasted like microwavable snacks they bought at the near by Sunrise Mart or JAS Mart.  I kid you not, the yaki onigiri at Decibel tasted just like a yaki onigiri I bought from "Hot Foods" vending machine at a game center in Japan.  blah!  Come on!  Does this place even have a proper kitchen?
Mike H.}Jersey City, NJ}0}4}0}-1}5}6/26/2008}If you do NOT want to wait in a dimly lit basement, next to the toilets, behind well worn rope barriers for 20-30 minutes to get in to a cramped table suitable for only 1/2 the people in your party...then you are missing something special. For the past 5-6 years, this place has consistently been our LAST place to visit before ending the night... the sake is amazing (get the chilled ones, and get a bottle or two), the wait behind the ropes by the bathoom is convenient enough for us to sober up *a bit* without having to venture far, and the snacks are nicely balanced, in taste, portions, and the timing (yes, even if they are microwaved).If you wish to experience a semi-authentic Japanese dive bar, then do not pass up the opportunity to pay this place a visit. Be careful of the sake if this is your first time - it has a potent latent kick to it.
Ari F.}MA, MA}77}28}0}-1}5}6/24/2008}Uhhh this place is very very very very very cool... I wish I could give it 6 stars. I've been here twice and found the Hamachi sashimi to be the most fresh, delicious, tender, raw fish I've had anywhere.The restaurant barely advertises itself- the sign out front is tiny and the place is down a flight of inconspicuous stairs. Graffiti on the walls, excellent groovy electronic music, and very dark lighting combine to create the lowest of profiles for Decibel. Also, the service is quite good and honorable. When the waiter discovered a crack in my sake glass, he brought out an entire extra bottle for us, gratis.
Joseph B.}New York, NY}11}23}0}-1}4}6/22/2008}mmmmmmm.. there's nothing like sipping on some sake and drinking beer. the beverage menu is impressive. i recommend taking someone or some people you can have a great conversation with. the dark, low lit underground (with the help of a little boozing) creates this surreal atmosphere. the staff was cool.. the tight space was packed but they did their best to accommodate our late arriving guests! on weekday nights it can be a nice and quiet spot to drink the night away.
Michael D.}New York, NY}78}185}1}-1}4}6/20/2008}Quickly becoming one of my favorite places to meet up with an old friend  after work and get soused on sake (and sundry Japanese cocktails, too). Voted "Best Bar to Make You Feel Like You Wandered Into a Sonny Chiba Movie!!!"When you can find the entrance  (and, later on, the exit) to this place without getting completely lost, then you know you're a regular.
Sharlene C.}Brooklyn, NY}73}668}84}-1}3}6/19/2008}this place was packed.  the sake is good.  i had the five bridges which is a fruity blend perfect for the summer.  we order dumplings, shrimp and pork.  yeah, skip the shrimp they were over steamed.  the pork packs quite a wasabi kick.  you have been warned.
SSQuo S.}London, United Kingdom}4}28}0}-1}4}6/14/2008}Ambience:  for people that love an experience, dining + more, should pay a visit.   Underground.  Unique.  Its like going to someones house, or rather that backroom that I have always wanted to be led into when I am watching any 'movies on the underground world' or the room where the 'deals happen'.  In this bar, as you are led into the small room filled with interesting wall decor and rustic furniture you feel special.  Then you realize its just a place that makes all its guests feel special and very soon it will be swarming with tons of youngish people gulping down their sake and munching on delicious small plates.  Must order: Dried squid, a dish I havent never eaten before, but it really is yummy.  Its like strings of coconut coir (in white!). Steamed eel was also good. Cooked well and in a nice sauce. Shumai - V. goodThe sake is very good, but for me the place decor and feel clinched the deal of my bond with Sake Bar Decibel.    Keywords: Relaxed, unique, small, not superficial, great staff and service, not too expensive, good easygoing and fun crowd that loves to talk.
Sasha B.}Washington, DC}71}541}27}-1}4}6/10/2008}I came here with two people and ended up leaving with 5, and mostly no one remembers leaving. Excellent. The atmosphere here is amazing. It's secretive, underground, cramped, and authentic. (I believe we tried some food...it was good but not anything special) The selection of sake is amazing and the sake itself was really good (maybe b.c we drank a lot or maybe b.c. we were lucky with the choices we made). This is an "original" spot to take a date. The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is it's kind of pricy...especially if you're a drinker.
Chris B.}Atlanta, GA}42}104}0}-1}4}6/3/2008}Pretty sweet, hole-in-the-wall sake bar. I can't say that my southern white self has much experience with sake bars, but the underground, cramped atmosphere was pretty cool and the sake was delicious. Plus, I hear it was mentioned on Gossip Girl, whatever that tells you...
Melissa C.}New York, NY}27}39}3}-1}5}5/29/2008}My friend might kill me for yelping this place.  But he brought a bunch of us here on Friday at 2 am.  And I really liked it.  The sake was good, and the food was decent.  But oh my, the sake was good.Yes, it's small and dark, but that makes for a more intimate atmosphere, right?
Alexander P.}New York, NY}4}51}0}-1}5}5/27/2008}If you can find it you will love it. Decibel is a small hole in the wall Sake Bar that could be overlooked even by a local. Once you find it (its easy once you know its there), you will adapt to its cramped basement space. The small space is always crowded, and for a good reason. Excellent drinks, great dating spot and a cool Japanese vibe make Decibel a destination for all that know its around. Although the finger food is just ok, and it always disappoints me that they do not have Sushi, the reason you come here is for its excellent quality and selection of Sake, and fabulous mixed Japanese drinks. Enjoy the exciting atmosphere, and make sure to get there early or else a table will be hard to come by. Tip: Don't be fooled by its cheap hole in the wall decor, the prices are fair, however its not as cheap as it looks.
Elle T.}New York, NY}18}125}0}-1}5}5/26/2008}went here two nights ago with some girlfriends. love it. has the ambiance of a japanese brothel..but in a good way. delicious drinks. would recommend the lychee martini or the pink rock. food is pretty good. BUT if you are looking for a big dinner or sushi this is not the place to go considering the food is basically small appetizers and there is no said sushi. great spot for hanging out with friends early in the night though. cute date spot as well.
Laura B.}Manhattan, NY}11}18}0}-1}4}5/8/2008}Decibel seems like that perfect hideway bar.  Well, it's not really a hideaway bar because it's so popular, but it's one my favorite places to take a date because you can achieve some privacy there and you (oddly enough) never seem to run into anyone you know. The sake's excellent, of course, but they've also got great nibbles, including stellar edamame. I love the wood decor and atmosphere. Definitely perfect for a more quiet evening getting really drunk on great rice wine.
Elizabeth R.}Hong Kong}6}34}4}-1}5}5/6/2008}what, we're not in kansas anymore?  i truly feel like i am in tokyo despite the fact that i've never been to tokyo (i suppose that is the beauty of new york city).  i close my eyes and pretend the bustling tokyo city life is outside and i've just arrived off the nearest bullet train to meet some friends....seriously now, i do love this place because it has lots of dark corners and you can chat with friends or bring a hot date and inappropriately make out with him/her over multiple servings of sake.  i tend to not frequent the uber-busy nights and like to stick to the less traveled evenings in order to guarantee some real quality talk/lip time without having to wait in line.
Donna D.}New York, NY}78}64}1}-1}4}4/16/2008}The best green tea rice I've ever had.  Prices are reasonable, and the selection of sake is almost overwhelming.  However, the place is almost always too crowded and you can expect to wait upwards of a half hour to be seated any day of the week, and especially on Friday and Saturday.  Expect traditional Japanese customer service.  By that I mean they will not come back to your table to ask if you need anything else, or to give you the check.  You have to pretty much hunt them down if you want their attention again after you've been initially served.  This is not meant to be rude or aloof.  They just do things differently.Oh, and the rumours are true.  If they believe that you did not leave a sufficient tip, they WILL chase you down and demand more money.  I've seen it happen on at least two occasions.
Jenn S.}Torrance, CA}502}633}99}-1}4}3/31/2008}Large selection of cold and hot sake. Remember that cold sake is usually better quality then hot sake.The lychee martini was really tasty too!I loved the ambiance cuz they played good hip-hop music but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't have a conversation at your table. The only weird thing was that we had a huge wooden fish dangling in the middle of our table. It was a little awkward.
Emily K.}New York, NY}14}234}0}-1}5}3/30/2008}My new favorite bar.  The entrance is underground and a bit hard to find... and you are no longer in NYC as soon as you enter.  The servers look like they all belong to the yakuza or something... which, in my giddy buzzed state, totally helped add to the atmosphere, ha.  ;)  That said, the staff has always been courteous and accommodating, although not very helpful if you're asking about the sake and trying to figure out what to order.  DOESN'T MATTER.  Be adventurous!  The place has a great vibe -- you can be as drunk and obnoxious as you want (just please, do it in your own corner) or it can be as chill and low-key as you'd like.Note that there is an $8 minimum per person.  They make great lychee martinis.  I wasn't too crazy about my nigori sake I got (a little too bitter for me), but there's an endless selection...  Didn't try any of the food, and you're probably better off going to the cheaper joints on St. Mark's or even nearby at Village Yokocho if you're in the mood for some real noshing.
Share W.}New York, NY}71}409}634}-1}4}3/18/2008}Holy Sake Batman!  I've never seen such a long list for sake before, but then again, this has been my only sake bar i only frequent.  It's small and quaint.  Old school stools to wooden tables.  Graffiti walls (my poem is up there...somewhere).  Dim seating area.Unfortunately the menu is just a list of it's japanese name and the only thing discerning each is if it's hot, cold, dry, etc.  I felt like a retard asking her "what was this...and this...how about this...ok...this...".  But the patient waitstaff is patient and ready to explain to you as best as they could what it is.  They'll even recommend you where to start as a newbie and what is considered good if you want to step into the wild side.  Immediately embarrassing thoughts of my ignorance disappear.SAKE!!  SAKE GOOD!
Julianne C.}Oakland, CA}383}273}168}-1}4}3/16/2008}Wow! I love Decibel! When I first heard about this bar, I was expecting yet another LES bar but no... Sake Bar Decibel is a hard to find, underground, tiny little bar with a "hidden" room in the back. Where you can truly experience a variety of sakes along with nibbles of small plates. They have your usual hot and col, dry or fruity, crisp or fragrant... I knew Decibel was a great little bar when I asked if they had any sparkling sake. And our server happily produced a pink bottle Kitaya (unknown to me), that was NOT on a menu. At $32 for a small bottle, it's not cheap but this is the going rate around Manhattan... This pink sparkling sake is the first of its kind that I tasted. And it's not as good as Tokimeki but still, a good find. I also ordered their Lychee Maritini (strong but good), Lemon Shochu (nothing special) and another "crispy and clean" sake. I can't recall the name because around this time, I was way over my threshhold of drinking! But I'm sure it was good! I loved the small space and hole-in-the-wall Japanese decor (even though the ladies' bathroom was a mess and the toilet wasn't working). The staff was friendly enough and helpful, for the most part. When we first walked in, there were about 12 people waiting in the "holding area". Fortunately, we had the right amount of people for a table that had just opened up. We didn't wait long but if we had, I may not have been a happy camper! I can't wait to to go back and try their other sakes!
Jason C.}New York, NY}34}50}9}-1}4}3/16/2008}This is the place for sake afficionados to get their buzz on!Open late, Saske Bar Decibel is a former speakeasy hidden away in a dark, smallish basement. But don't let that deter you. Be adventurous and brave the lines for a pretty fun and chaotic experience. There are quite a variety of drinks on the menu, including many types of sake's and sake inspired/infused drinks. We didn't get much help in the "I don't know what to order, help me pick something out" department, but after a bunch of experimenting, we ordered enough drinks to fill our cramped table and our bellies. We also ordered some light appetizers, including pork shumai w/wasabi and okonomiyaki with donkatsu sauce, the latter of which was quite delish.The cool thing about the place is the waitstaff is generally pretty accomodating. We kept adding people to our little table and they didn't seem to have any issues with it. This place gets cramped and the quarters are tight, but it's all part of the vibe. Also, they played some really weird music that sounded like synth pop played backwards -- kind of an odd ambiance, but when you're drinking it doesn't really matter.Warning: the place is full of youngsters and NYU kids, so I had to get used to feeling like the "old guy" in there.
Eric B.}Brooklyn, NY}166}81}0}-1}4}3/10/2008}getting wasted off anglo booze is so passe, but getting trashed of sake is elegant and romantic, especially when choosing them off a substantial menu.we showed up around 8pm on a sunday night, and saw the place fill up by 8:05, empty out by 9pm, fill back up at 9:05pm, etc.  i guess it's a great meeting place or a great place to take a date to get trashed quickly.most new yorker alchies should be able to make their way through 3 or 4 sake selections and still leave in a dignified stumble.
Di L.}Berkeley, CA}26}72}40}-1}5}3/3/2008}This place is a gem.I was first introduced to this bar before their fancy sign went up. You couldn't find it unless someone pointed you exactly to it's underground entrance. These days, this trendy hole fills up on the weekends only 15 minutes after opening. Decibel's sake selection is extensive. The wait staff has always been helpful toward my party when it comes to decisions in trying new drinks. The bar food is not notable, but its overall package is so impressive that it doesn't even matter. The cramped seating and small tables make Decibel a great first date, but somewhat uncomfortable for larger parties.
Jeff C.}New York, NY}1142}1258}14}-1}5}3/2/2008}Hands down, this is the premier place to get wasted on sake. There is so much selection and munchies that they make sure no one walks out sober. Japanese wait staff greet you and (are supposed to) card you upon entry. Open til 2:50am so you can drink to your heart's content.  $8/80 buys you a glass/huge bottle of Otokoyama. Decor: Underground, a bit cramped, can get loud with everyone talking at the same time.
John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}5}2/24/2008}One of my absolute most favorite places in New York and a place I've been coming to regularly for years.  The sakes are terrific and it is fun to work your way through the list and try new ones.  This is where I found my very sake anywhere - Dassai from Yamaguchi.  The decor is Tokyo cool and the service is always friendly.  On top of the incredible sakes, the bar food is very good here.  Just an awesome place.
bobby j.}Brooklyn, NY}2}4}0}-1}5}2/22/2008}I have been here a few times and, even when crowded, the service was very good. It has a dungeon ambiance that fits the atmosphere of this sake bar. Whatever kind of sake you want, they have!You can sit at the main bar in front or get a table. You can even get a private booth that fits about six or so.I didn't try any of the "snacks" my friends ordered, but they said they were good.
Jessica A.}Brooklyn, NY}85}181}0}-1}5}2/22/2008}Definitely one of the coolest places I have been in a long while. I can't believe I have never ventured into this dark cave before. Tons of awesome sake, grafittied walls, little Japanese snacks and some of the freshest sashimi I've had. In the middle of winter. The exceedingly tall emo hipster Japanese waiter was just a perk.
Eliza C.}Jackson Heights, Queens, NY}66}72}15}-1}4}1/30/2008}I swear to Buddha, when I was here I really thought I was teleported to Nippon. The interior decore, the low budget side street tables and chairs used, the staff was very Japaneesey. Dimly lit, fine selection of sake AND finger food as well as noodle bowls. I went on a hot summer weekend, so it was a little too loud because of all the people; not a great place for a date when packed. Space is small though it does provide a communal feel, especially with the intimate lighting. But good place if you are looking for is an intimate teleported experience into Japan.
Jonathan S.}New York, NY}15}22}0}-1}5}1/30/2008}Over the last few years Decibel went from being a hidden gem to one of the most popular sake bars in the city. A dark, intimate underground space, it has a huge selection of sake (from by the glass to by the 1.5L magnum), some beer and a small menu of Japanese snack food. It's got a great feel and is always fun if you can get in.Getting a seat, however, has become increasingly difficult, especially on weekends, once again due to its size and popularity. Weekdays would be your best bet, or going before 9pm on a weekend. Also, the larger tables handle about five people max, so avoid going with a big group of people.On a random note, I was surprised to find decent cellphone reception while down there.
Alex Y.}New York, NY}1}7}1}-1}4}1/30/2008}Decibel is difficult to find, and difficult to figure out. Did they not want us to sit in the front bar area? I'm glad we did, because otherwise we would have missed the beetle sumo wrestling videos they were playing up there. I had the same guilty feeling that I have when I travel to a foreign country and I don't know the language. Maybe I'm just that culturally sensitive. In short, I'm pretty sure the staff was friendly, but if not then it was my fault for not knowing the Japanese language and customs.I'm no sake expert, but I do know they had a wide selection, and the bottle we ordered was tasty and effective. I will certainly be back here, but I might check out Lonely Planet Japan before I return.
John M.}New York, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}1/29/2008}This is one of those "only in NY places" where you wake up and say "what the hell was that?!" There is almost no sign and you would miss the bar concrete stairs down to the non-descript "entrance" if you weren't looking for it. Inside looks like you stepped into some Tokyo underground bar , the kind that Bruce Lee would even think twice about entering- just too strange to describe. The staff is all straight from Japan and speak little English but couldn't be nicer. The sake menu is extensive but completely written in Japanese. Basically, just have everyone in your group order something else and pass the glasses until you settle on a few you like. In reality, the waiter could just bring you whatever he waited and you wouldn't know the difference. The crowd was a pretty even mix of all kinds: Japanese punk rockers, NYU yuppies, Banking yuppies in training, boozers, regular Jo's, girls looking for bankers, girls looking for girls, ext. Overall the atmosphere is really cool and I recommend this as a place to go when you want an interesting night out that breaks up your usual routine. Bonus: The last time I was there, some guy broke an empty Sake bottle over another guys head and a fight broke out. +1 Star!
Maritess Z.}Seattle, WA}598}281}9}-1}5}1/8/2008}It looks and feels like Japan in here. David S. and I spent $200 here last year just drinking bottles of Sake and eating a few small plates. I'm going to miss that David S and his Asiaphile ways. He can really smell out those authentic Asian experiences. The sake list was beyond extensive, it was damned impressive and I love the intimacy and the secrecy of the place. One of my favorite places in New York.
Chris H.}Hong Kong}173}603}2111}-1}5}1/8/2008}Every once and a while, you stumble upon an establishment that makes you verbally exclaim, "holy crap, I feel like i'm in an movie!".  This effect can take many forms, such as:- Mars Bar (Saw II)- Red Rock West (Saw III)- Cielo (Night at the Roxbury)- Times Square (Phone Booth) - Washington Square Park (Kids)- Anywhere in Brooklyn (Fargo)Walking into Decibel, you feel like you're in a movie.  Dim lighting, graffiti, wooden benches, and uber-cool waiters serving sake to uber-cool patrons.  A mind boggling and liver scarring assortment of sakes, beers and cocktails are presented to you by a waiter who call himself "Shinji" and probably spends more money a month on his hair product than you do on your monthly unlimited metro pass.You huddle with your drinking companions in the dark and cozy tables, your mind wavering between the conversation happening across from you and the stranger's conversations happening on either side of you.Drunk on sake and indie music, you stumble out, startled by the maroon glow of "MAX BRENNER:  CHOCOLATE BY THE BALD MAN" sign and scurry like a cockroach for Astor Place.  *
Helen C.}Oakland, CA}5}265}4}-1}1}1/8/2008}0 stars actually, because the bartender here ruined a perfectly enjoyable night by being a chauvanistic pig. He had been perfectly pleasurable for the night, despite mostly ignoring my presence and talking to my boyfriend as if I didn't exist, sitting right next to him.  The place is truly authentic, right down to the overt male chauvanism that is a strong cultural feature in Japan, where the bartender was from.  After spending $100 on various glasses of pricey sake (and a few bar snacks, which were expertly removed from the frozen store-bought plastic wrapper and microwaved in front of us), my boyfriend and I were definitely toasted and done for the night (he more than I). He could hardly stand in fact. He wanted to order more, despite being clearly intoxicated, and I told the bartender not to serve him since he had way too much. The bartender looked right at me, and yet through me at the same time - I have never been looked at with such disrespect anywhere in NY - and then turned his back to me and poured another huge glass of sake for my extremely inebriated boyfriend. Nice. Too bad the bastard wasn't around to help clean up the vomit I had to deal with all night, but I suppose he wouldn't have anyway since that's "a woman's job."
Eric C.}Williamsburg, NY}66}36}0}-1}4}1/8/2008}Great atmosphere! Underground, dark, and definitely unique. They had a great selection of sake, which included by stand by Wakatake Onikoroshi Daiginjo for a reasonable $45 for a 720ml bottle. When I used to drink the stuff in SF, it would easily have cost me $70-$90. There goes the idea that not all things in NY are more expensive. The Izakaya plates were tasty but a tad small, always wishing for a last bite that wasn't there. I'll be frequenting this place a lot more!
Alice M.}London, United Kingdom}174}193}32}-1}4}1/3/2008}On 9th Street, between Max Brenner's and Cha An (two of my favorite dessert places in the East Village) resides a tiny underground Sake bar, with its only sign as a sketch of a sake bottle and small black lettering painted onto a thin wooden 1' x 1' sq board.Small and high in demand, there's often a wait to be seated in its very cozy and Japanese-styled back room.  What's great about Decibel is that it's open until 2:50am on Mondays through Saturdays, making it easy to stop by after dinner or for a late night snack.Decibel may be cash only, with an $8 per person minimum-  price you pay to be granted a seat in the swanky Decibel back room~^perfect for small groups.
Ryland A.}Los Feliz, CA}269}25}3}-1}5}12/25/2007}Decibel is where I was when I realized I need to move to NY.A hot tip sent me searching for the tiny sign that denotes entrance to this subterranean sake sanctuary.  Once inside I was momentarily fooled by the small entrance bar.  Do not tarry in small entrance bar.  Past the velvet rope lies the traintracks underpass decor of an izakaya that is easily as chill as some of the coolest tokyo spots.Nothing but impressed by the extensive sake selection - all at totally reasonable prices.  I started with my solid standby, Otokoyama, and was served a generous overflowed helping.  With such great prices I was able to do what I like best - try a bunch of new things - some hits, some misses, but certainly none were bad.  Didn't try any food, but it looked like a standard small selection of some izak faves.  Didn't really ask for any recs from the staff, but I saw one waiter chatting with a table with no pretension.This is the kinda place I would be thrilled to stumble into in Tokyo.  I'll be there all the time when I finally make the NYC move.
Armin L.}New York, NY}19}83}0}-1}5}12/25/2007}If you want sake in New York, this is the place to go. Hidden away in the east village, where the only sign is a small one on a wall. You walk down these stairs, into a room where you wait until there is a table. You can stand at the bar if you don't want a table. Once inside, the sake selection is enormous. They also have small dishes, but nothing big enough to call it a full meal, so don't with a huge appetite.
Louis A.}Brooklyn, NY}181}187}7}-1}5}11/9/2007}Decibel is the best bar I've ever been to in my life (and I have been to a lot of bars) --- better than a few places I've been to in Japan.Dingy, great for small groups, excellent background music, superb atmosphere, and strong sake. I want to own this place.
Katie K.}San Francisco, CA}275}334}110}-1}5}11/7/2007}I love this bar! It may be hard to find b/c it is located underground. The first room you walk into is the main bar followed by a hallway into a larger room with booths. The whole decor of the place made me feel like I traveled thousands of miles to Japan.I will surely be back for the sparkling sake that tasted like berry juice.
David S.}San Diego, CA}304}652}282}-1}5}10/27/2007}Oh yes!! After reading of the place on Yelp, I felt like I just had to check it out. I went on a weeknight at around 10pm. The place is easy to miss, and in fact I walked past it without noticing it even though I had the address and was looking for it specifically. You have to go down a flight of stairs, and as soon as you walk the door you enter a different world. The bar is actually quite large, and very dark. It was almost full when I went, but luckily we were able to get a table almost immediately. The drinks and sake selection is very impressive. After a lychee martini (very strong and reasonably priced: $8), my bf and I shared a bottle of daiginjo, which was quite tasty and also really cheap ($45, though obviously there were much more expensive ones on the menu). They also sell appetizers and small plate food: we ended up getting the bowl of lychees ($4), and the mochi ice-cream sampler ($4, but very small portions). Great drinks, and a fun experience... our bill came at about $80, which is very reasonable considering the amount we drank. I'll be back!
Kate V.}San Francisco, CA}472}493}425}18}5}10/25/2007}This is the quintessential [literally] underground New York hipster hangout. As Carrie Bradshaw imitating Dolce & Gabanna would say... me likey!!Decibel was the first stop of our Saturday night city gallivanting. We figured we'd pregame on sake before gettin' down at Passerby in Chelsea.We rolled in a little before 10, and Jim and Sean, oldtimers to Decibel, anticipated the line to be out the door by that time on a Saturday night. By sheer luck, it turned out that there was just one party in front of us, and we actually could have been seated right away but we wanted a bigger table than the first available. So we waited maybe like half an hour. Which, at a place like this, is not considered a wait at all.Decibel is deceiving from the foyer. The waiting area is dark, quiet, and the rest of the restaurant is blocked off with a velvet rope (nice Hollywood touch) so it's hard to tell there's even anything going on behind it. Once you're actually IN Decibel, the sound certainly intensifies a few, and the sake bar comes to life. In the dim lighting, beautiful people abound, cramped into tealight lit booths surrounded by walls covered in socially conscious scrawl (a haiku about a vagina just happened to be graffitied right in my line of vision... how stimulating...).Adding to the ambiance were the hosts and waiters--mostly very attractive Asian American men, yay! I later confirmed the beauty along with authenticity factor of the wait staff when our orders were taken and brought by a tiny Japanese woman in a short, funky kimono and an accented Japanese man in dreads.Of course, this review wouldn't be complete without something to say about what was consumed. We ordered 2 different types of warm sake (can't remember which ones), Sapporo, and about 6 appetizers. The roasted garlic cloves were INSANELY good. The 2 types of sashimi we ordered were fresh. I forget what else we ate... the sake must have gotten to me by that point (you don't come to this place for food AT ALL).My wallet suffered a little... but so worth it. This place is soooo amazingly chic and VIP feeling. As much as I love San Francisco, you would never find a place like this here... perhaps in LA, but not any closer.Even though we had to stop for pizza right after, Decibel is still in my NY trip Top 3.
andy t.}New York, NY}258}439}33}-1}4}10/17/2007}Decibel is an awesome little sake bar. It's the kind of underground place you may have walked past a million times without knowing it's even there. A great place to impress a date with your knowledge of an insider's NYC. There are many options for sake and some tasty apps as well. The atmosphere is fun and casual.
Bergdorf Brunette ..}New York, NY}6}86}0}-1}5}10/8/2007}I'm sad that at least 76 others know about Decibel... The sake list is great and prices are good so you can try all sorts.  Decent edamame and other bar treats if you're feeling peckish.
Djaz I.}Boston, MA}148}113}27}-1}3}9/27/2007}This really used to be one of my favorite places to go, and my favorite place to go out to on my birthday, but a lot of things have changed in the last 5 years.This last time around, I was out with a group of friends for my birthday. They stuck us at tables that didn't have enough room for all of us, and then ignored us. I caught the attention of the waiter, he looked at me and acknowledged me, and then continued to ignore us. Moving to a booth that could fit all of us caused a serious battle of wills, but finally all of us sat together.The drinks were quite good, and the food was very good as well (though the okonomiyaki has seriously shrunk), but then the waiter miscounted his tip and chased after us and we had to wait while he recounted properly.I think Decibel works best for groups of 4 people or less. My birthday tends to involve 6+ people, which is tough for a space that small.Do I love this place? Indeed I do, but it's starting to look like Decibel doesn't love me back. Next year, new birthday spot...
Ray Y.}Los Angeles, CA}41}39}4}-1}3}9/11/2007}3.5 stars.I probably sound harsh, but this is a poor-man's Sakagura.  The sake selection was ok, and the ones I ordered were mediocre.  I wanted to try their bottle of Tsukasabotan, since i had tried that vintage at 15 East, but they ran out.  Also had some food (onigiri, ochazuke), and it was bland and non-extraordinary.  Based on food/drinks alone, I would give this place 2 or 2.5 stars.  However, the ambience is amazing.  It's not everybody's cup of tea, but you go downstairs into a basement, and the place has been packed everytime I've gone.  Then you sit pretty packed together, and you can barely hear yourself.  However, I love it, because there's so much energy, and it feels festive - in fact, it exemplifies what I love about the East Village atmosphere.  Not a place to grab dinner, but a decent place to go after or before for drinks with friends or with a pretty down-to-earth date.
Andrea C.}New York, NY}102}276}0}-1}4}8/31/2007}Felt like an underground, special world.Loved the chilled masumi sake and lychee martini!!Great service and a very chill ambiance...Also served up yummy snacks - edamame, steamed scallops,shrimp dumplings and rice cracker snacks... so tasty!!!Definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants a good place for sake and snacks.
Lex A.}Las Vegas, NV}57}138}59}-1}4}8/23/2007}Let me tell you this:The last time I was here was in April 2006. To my right was a very young looking gorgeous Asian girl and on my dates left in the booth (with the girl) was a very old white guy - and they were drinking up a storm. Not Sake but cheap tequila. And lots of mochi and other stuff. This is THE place to score with your step-daughter, oops, I mean date! yes the date - you paid for.. I mean are treating to a night out. But I love that. C'mon where else can you see that stuff happening in FRONT of you?
Randall F.}New York, NY}11}33}0}-1}4}7/29/2007}This place is dark, dirty-looking, small, and hot (not to mention hidden in some basement along 9th).  Initially, I questioned the taste of our friend who brought us here and wanted to slap him.  But then the sake started to flow and this became the best place on earth. Great sake for good times in the company of good friends.
Jesper J.}San Francisco, CA}3}11}0}-1}4}7/28/2007}Love the rope they have at the entrance "blocking" your way further in!Unfortunately I spent way too short time in this place, so I will have to go back as soon as I can. I didn't taste the food, but they had one of my favorite sakes (kikusui). Everything else about this place makes me want to go back. It's dark, divey in a Japanese way, great place to drink.Consider this a stub (in the wikipedia sense). I'll have to go back and will report back later.
Robyn F.}San Francisco, CA}62}454}1}-1}4}7/25/2007}this place is EXTREMELY HOT, but i like this spot a lot.  it's definitely cozy and best for small groups.  the sake selection here is phenomenal.  i especially like the mu sake.
Cindy C.}San Mateo, CA}675}619}40}18}4}6/21/2007}I learned so much about all the different kinds of sakes visiting this place.  I also love their lichee martini.  This place was always an all time favorite, even though there's almost always a wait and can get loud...
Ann H.}Los Angeles, CA}63}67}8}-1}5}6/18/2007}Yay~~~ finally checked this place off my bookmarked list!! This place is soooo much fun!!! There was a line when we got there, but for some reason we were seated immediately. We had our own table and each ordered a bottle of Sapporo (me under peer pressure lol) and a bottle of Sake. The sake had a really fruity aroma and it was really good. Mmm I could drink lots of this and not get drunk. But what I really loved the most about this place, is that we could get as loud and raucous as we wanted, and no one would care. We only had our neighboring table competing with us in how loud we could get!  Fun times....!
Til T.}SUNNYSIDE, NY}71}33}4}-1}5}6/8/2007}love this place but the line can be out of control on the weekends. go early or on a weeknight. get yourself a booth and drink your lil heart out. i like that the servers are tolerant of smokers. we were able to drink a round leave the table, smoke our lil hearts out and come back to a fresh new round of beers. their okonomiyaki wasn't on the menu but is available if you ask for it. food is ok here you're better off at one of the joints on astor but then again who's comin here to eat?
Eric Z.}Los Angeles, CA}0}37}1}-1}4}5/31/2007}I like this place, I'd definitely go again.  A dive bar atmosphere and a great drinking place.  You would never know it was there unless somebody told you about it.We went here before we actually went out, so we didnt get a chance to try all the various sake they had.  Also didn't get a chance to try the food.  But based on the unique atmosphere alone I give it 4 stars.A good place to sit with a couple of friend's and take shot after shot of sake.
Vanessa H.}Orinda, CA}153}826}2}18}4}5/29/2007}A friend told us to meet her here. We walked right past it, then backtracked, found it and went down the stairs underground, past the rope and into the back room.  Pretty darn cool. Felt like a speakeasy.We drank cold unfiltered sake from wooden boxes. Why? I don't know. I think the japanese had porcelin early on, but the box cups help bring out the peasant in all of us.
christine h.}Brooklyn, NY}360}64}0}-1}5}5/28/2007}i guess you could call it "one sick den of the EV Japanese underground." or you could just call it a really good sake bar.
Caroline A.}Fairfax, VA}1132}1178}22}-1}5}5/28/2007}I'll admit, I was a bit scared when I first walked in.  I had already had a lot of sake, only to enjoy more :)Decibel is hip, dark, cool and pretty darn sexy. My ex is a sake aficionado, and Decibel is his usual hangout.  We got there late, and polished off a bottle of sake (have no idea what kind).  We also ordered a tofu dish, but I didn't have any as my face was in the mochi ice cream.  Best mochi ice cream ever.  EVER.  It was so good, that we ordered five. HA!  Green tea is fantastic.Will be back, Decibel.  Kampai!
Jessica Y.}Austin, TX}319}156}59}-1}5}5/11/2007}The underground sake bar... dimly lit and surrounded by dark wood, Decibel is the perfect destination for snowy nights.. nothing warms up the tummy like hot sake.Sake was my first love.  It was sake who first taught me what intoxicated love truly meant.  Even 'til this day, I hold a special spot in my heart for it...So when I visited friends in NYC and they took me to Decibel, I was smitten once again.  With 70 different types of sake to try, I could've stayed all night!Even if you're a sake virgin, you'd enjoy this place.  try the yuzu zake (hot sake with orange peel) or the lychee martini.  Or be adventurous and try the milky ones.Kanpai~!
Maria W.}NY, NY}893}762}653}18}5}5/11/2007}Excellent spot for a lychee martini or sojo mixed drink. First bar me and my mister went to we we set up our East Village Love Shack. Will always hold sweet memories for me. Love that you might not find this place unless you knew to look for it.
Pam S.}Brooklyn, NY}186}412}399}-1}4}4/29/2007}A dark hole in the ground with a vibe unique from all the other watering holes in the area. Completely packed, dark, dingy.. like you're in the basement of a private bar in Japan. They were also playing some awesome jazz.. good vibes overall. I didn't drink, but my friends seemed to be having fun. We snacked on edamame (so-so) and Okonomiyahi (Japanese pancake - not bad). Hardly noticeable unless you were looking to go here - this 'secret' location is a cool place to take a non-NYer. Would bring drinker friends back if they wanted Sake. There is usually a wait if you don't get lucky like we did, and walked right in the second time we tried.
Joolie T.}Brooklyn, NY}1083}1296}1020}-1}4}4/28/2007}(check out the pictures!)sexy? yes. secretive? undoubtedly. authentic? of course. need a deciphered code to order drinks? possibly. a great venue to bring your sake-lovin' friends? no doubt! it's not hard getting to "deh-shi-bell", it's right passed the Sunrise Mart, St. Mark's book shop, the bakery, and right before Max Brenner (chocolate by the baldman) restaurant. it's easy to miss, though! there's a small little wooden sign (refer to pictures) and a flight of stairs leading to a small, sexy, and very inclusive setting- that is Sake Bar Decibel. you tell them how many people are in your party. they let you cross their "pretend velvet rope" and guide you to a japanese underground... how cool and exciting! we sat at the table with the metal Koi fish in the middle of the table. it's for heating up tea and/or sake. very nice! i ordered the Pink Rock- very flirty and sweet. i loved it. the Lychee Martini is quite strong, but it was just what the doctor ordered! the had great presentation and delivery... i tried the sardine wrapped in fresh seaweed. very delightful. i would have to agree with Javier and say the service was quite disappointing. they would only accept his and my cards- everyone else had to cough up cash or something annoying. it took forever to get our check, order our food/drinks, and actually get out of the place! if it wasn't for that issue- i would have given this place 5 stars.
Maria M.}New York, NY}247}509}52}-1}5}4/23/2007}I didn't get to try everything I wanted to, but I'm sure I'll be here at least a few more times in my NYC experience.I can't remember what my drink was called, but it was sake and peach Schnapps, and it was goood!  I could spend a whole night just drinking these and talking away with friends.  I was there with Maritess, Joolie, Oliver and Javier.  Javi got some appetizers, and he made the mistake of offering something to me.  So I just took the liberty of chowing down on almost everything.  I think other people ate too.?.?.?You can miss the place entirely if you're not sure where you're going!  But I like that.  As Javier says, it is the "speakeasy" effect.Next time, I will expect Julie and Sean!!!!!
Javier M.}New York, NY}707}388}173}-1}4}4/22/2007}To say this place is secret is an understatement. If you are not told that this is located right before the corner of 9th you'll probably pass it by... you go down the little stairs through a black nondescript door, once in, you'll immediately find yourself in a low ceiling underground; lights subdued, walls are replete of a Japanese equivalent of American punk decor of sorts (kanji lettering, upon kanji lettering and other japanese ads/flyers, etc) Once seated, a combination of traditional Japanese ornament mixes with the wall decor in perfect silentio harmony; a tea pot is hanging from a wooden pole in the middle of our table; it keeps the pot warm via a heater at the center.Now, I must say that I only sampled their yellow tail sashimi which was incredible; and if this is any indication of the rest, we'll upgrade to 5 stars really soon (despite what I'm about to report a few lines below)For drinks I ordered a sweet potato shoju that was a little on the strong, but good side. Only the service was a little bit faulty and slow; they only accept two credit cards per table at the time of the tab, so be prepared, as you wont be able to break the bill between many ppl who want to use credit cards.Other than that, this place is PERFECT for taking friends for drinks, hosting duty, conversation, dates, etc
Caroline M.}Brooklyn, NY}41}198}2}-1}4}4/20/2007}Love this place.  You feel very in-the-know going downstairs to this  little underground sake joint, not to mention the fact that the sake selection is terrific and they make the best lychee martinis I've ever tasted.I've got to say, the service was a little slow; they took forever to "notice" my group (well, two of us) and seat us. After that, though, it rocked.
Julie K.}New York, NY}226}418}883}-1}5}4/20/2007}my sake lover friend recommend this special black diamond..I am not going to tell you about my sad story..sake + lychee + music + friends + kudos = drunken Korean girl..please enjoy other's reviews... even cavemen can do it...   easy??    =)no more words for ya!  just go check it out!!
Sean T.}New York, NY}21}86}64}-1}5}4/18/2007}For many people, the 100th review is special, but for me, it is the 99th.  In Japan, the #3 is a very special number, so 3 3s, now THATs special :)   I usually start off with a recommendation and score, but here, I want to dedicate this review, to my late sister, Yuko!  The greatest sister in the world, Yuko passed away 7th of February, 2007. Therefore this 99th review and location is totally for you Sis!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recommended for:  hang out with friends, a date, taking a trip to Tokyo without a 13 hour flight, drinking mass amounts of delicious Sake.Service 5, Drinks 5, Ambiance 5.After meeting up with a friend for dinner who recently lost someone, we made our way to this secret gem. Tucked down in the basement of a building (you need to look carefully for the sign) is Sake Bar Decibel.   Walk down a hidden staircase and be welcomed into this great bar/lounge. Once inside, this place made me instantly think of lounge I went to in February in Shibuya-ku with a true angel, my sis - Yuko ;)Ordered a LARGE bottle 700ml+ of Junmai Daiginjo, we toasted to those we had lost. Remembering fond memories and taking in the great music and atmosphere. Drawings on the walls, hip tunes, and GREAT Sake!  I truly couldn't ask for anything more.The wait-staff was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant, bringing me more and more Sake bottles without me having to really ask - it was as though we were psychically linked. The unfiltered sake, an acquired taste was not really what I wanted, but after ordering some lychee (which I later dipped in my sake shot... ssshhhhh don't tell Yuko), I was truly happy.A few hours later, a few bottles later, we realized it was 1am and time to go (work tomorrow... boooo).  I will definitely come back here with good friends or by myself. They have food, and I will definitely try next time, but be warned, this place is small and fills up fast... maybe I'll throw a party here...If you want a truly amazing bar that has great service and Sake, definitely come here!  Yuko, another toast to you!  Thank you for all the fond memories... you will be sorely missed.Love, Sean!  *Kampai!*Sean Approved:  Zettaini ita houga ii yo!!!
Michelle C.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}75}29}1}-1}3}4/16/2007}I'm not particularly a big sake fan, actually...i'm not at all. but, i did try their udon which was pretty good (then again, i can't remember if i was hungry or just drunk). the place did make me feel kind of claustrophobic...if you're in to the underground (literally speaking) and don't mind feeling like all 4 walls are closing in on you or perhaps you want a place where nobody can see you (cause it sure as hell dim in there), then this place is it.
Olivia C.}Jamaica Plain, MA}85}186}11}-1}4}4/16/2007}Saki shots!!? Spend the extra money and get specialty saki if you can possibly decide btwn the 1,000 choices--the light flowery saki is good.  Lychee is lovely! Where has that vegetable been all my life??!! I like it tradionally; hot.  I, the token white girl at my table, slowly nursed the hardcore house saki/ frou frou rubbing alcohol, eying my saki drinking rouletters, trying to become immune to the poison for my next duel.The saki is potent!!! Before I brought it to my lips the vapors glazed my eyes over, reddened my cheeks,  warmed and scraped my cerebral, excited and warned my stomach and made me incapable of telling a lie. As a girl on long island I swear I used to dab my freshly pierced ears with this stuff..Everything is sexy in this mazy, bass thumping, hip, basement palace.  I waited at that velvet rope, like a little girl excited to travel around the world and the Japanese bartenders are too sexy for their saki but the people themselves seem regular and good. Our table had a well in it; as in a giant hole with a bucket attached to a rope and a brass fish. I still don't know what the fuck that's for but we were tripping. But what's this I hear about no sushi??  I didn't even try the food here yet, and I lust after this place. We ate at Joe's Ginger..So go head and clean your wounds and give saki a try even if you say you don't like it or you're afraid or whatever--Come on, you know you want to at least sit in this atmosphere, you sexy, sexy, celebrity you
Viv C.}El Sobrante, CA}163}339}56}-1}5}4/4/2007}Continuing in the theme of crowded basement Japanese establishments, we continued our night at Decibel for some sake and other libations. Finding this place was slightly difficult as all you have to go by is a little glowing red square with a sake bottle and cup above the stairwell downward.There might be a bit of a wait for larger parties since most tables there can only seat up to about six. Decibel underground atmosphere with exposed brick, sake bottle stickers on the wall and tree trunks dividing the room adds to the air "oh-so-coolness." Add in the enjoyable indie hip hop and break-beats and you've got yourself a memorable evening with friends.There's a variety of sake to choose from including blowfish fin sake which Lily ordered and ingested...slowly as she thought it tasted nasty. I didn't think it was too bad. It's like a warm fishy sake soup. If you're into that kind of thing. Kay's kaori sake was flavorful yet mild. I ordered the oolong tea and wheat liquor (I can't remember the proper Japanese name for it) which I termed "the original Red Bull and vodka." A little alcohol, a little caffeine, a good way to keep the night rolling.Jeff had a lychee martini which I had to have as well. If you're a fan of lychees, then you'll probably get sufficiently drunk off this drink.With about two drinks each for five people plus two orders of shrimp chips, the bill came to a manageable $10-$15 a person. Which isn't too bad considering some places charge $10 for a cocktail.Overall, this is another NYC establishment I want replicated in SF. Sigh.
Megu K.}San Francisco, CA}251}26}50}-1}4}3/15/2007}I love that I had some trouble finding this place and had to carefully walk down the treacherous stairs to the basement level, and then almost (mistakenly) sat at the front bar instead of the tables in the back. It added to the sense of mystery of the place.Once I made myself comfortable in the dark candlelit cave of a bar, I realized how much it reminded me of izakayas and other hip bars in Tokyo. I was so happy to know that all the servers were Japanese. The sake selection is great and they have general descriptions about the different types, and the servers are also good about making suggestions. The food munchies are tasty albeit small in size; I only wish they had more selection. I mean come on, no karaage, and out of yaki onigiri? So sad. Overall, I heart this place and can't wait to go back.
Chris L.}New York, NY}96}276}9}-1}4}3/3/2007}A fun place to go for drinks with a few friends - you'll probably have to wait for one of the few tables in there, but once you're seated you'll find yourself in another world - feels like a cool, hidden, japanese speakeasy sake bar with weird kitchy things around and real Japanese waitors. Order a bottle of sake, some crackers, get ready for a fun night of drinks with your friends...
Sooj O.}New York, NY}131}362}0}-1}5}2/19/2007}I love this place, although I have to say the best times I've had here have been on weekday nights rather than the crowded weekends.Small little plates of Japanese food (love their grilled fish plates), sake all around, and way too hip Japanese guys serving you. During the weekdays, it's almost mellow.  On the weekends, be prepared to be elbow to elbow with strangers.  And if folks at your table or their table have too much to drink, it gets pretty interesting.  Not only have I eavesdropped, but conversations have gotten entangled between various tables.
N. M.}New York, NY}27}194}9}-1}4}2/19/2007}Well, I finally made it to Decibel. I think if a place is a little hidden it actually has a better chance of being trampled because hype it is sure to ensue. New Yorkers just love hidden jems, and hip Japanese jems? You get the picture. The place opened at 8pm (we went on a Sunday), and by 8:30 the place was packed, although we still got a seat at the bar. By the time we left the entry was packed with people waiting.That said, I still had a great time. The sake was amazing (the selection is impressive), and we had some edamame to snack on, which was excellent (the food menu is more of a snack menu). Even if trampled, the place does feel like a hide-away, having just a small sign at the top of a steep stairway. The interior has a front bar and a larger backroom with tables and another bar. Service was pretty good (although sprinkled with that all-to-familiar too cool blase hipsterness that this city could use less of). Will go again though. That sake was amazing.
Alicia D.}San Francisco, CA}65}68}0}-1}3}2/14/2007}Meh.I thought I was special the first time I went here since Decibel is sort of hidden and shady...Then I realized that everyone does in fact know of its existence and I'm not actually special at all.It's really too bad because a secret sake bar could be pretty exciting (plus it's fun to say "secret sake bar"), even though I'm not a huge fan of sake to begin with.
Dale K.}San Francisco, CA}306}96}0}-1}4}1/29/2007}Having just escaped from the clutches of my east coast sales team members, some of us from Cali are lead by our one NY friend to this hole-in-the-wall.  Well, actually hole in the ground... the Fire Marshall must have a field day with this joint cause the sight of this joint reminds me of a fire trap just waiting to happen.  The stairwell to go down below is barely wide enough for one person to go up/down.  And once inside, they made us wait behind literally... a velvet rope... as the hostess scanned our out of state licenses meticulously for the DOB info.  (The crew averaged in age to about 32 years!).  But once we gave the secret handshake and nod of the head, while balancing on one leg, we were led to the table area.  The list of sake... naturally, was quite comprehensive.  Although my colleagues did not want to investigate too deeply and just ordered the 'unfilter cold nigori' sake... good choice, but let's venture off the beaten path here kids!!!  So I took the liberty ordering the side dishes.... fermented octopus in a 'sauce', and agedashi tofu.. these were all left for me to consume... others just ate the shrimp chips.  The feel of the joint is down right raw... but that's what I love... while the attempts to make it feel like street-Japan is passable, it's the understated 'Viva la Tokyo" atmosphere that makes it cool.  Would I go here again... mos'def.  Do I remember how to get here... you'll have to ask the cab driver!
Doron R.}Orlando, FL}71}204}55}-1}4}1/25/2007}No Sushi amd they only have a microwave, so don't come here for the food.  It is a Japanese bar with Japanese bar cuisine.  But, the sake selection is perfect and the place is cool.  Come here to get away with a date or friends and get wasted on sake.  sometimes bottles smash, and people get wild occasionally, but that's the way it should be.  The staff is notoriously rude, but if they are rude to you, just be rude back!
Nick N.}Chicago, IL}7}20}0}-1}3}1/18/2007}I was taken to Decibel by my horrific ex, which is entirely too appropriate since I'd describe them both the same way.  They're both way too expensive, but they're so fucking hip and trendy and hot that you want to fu... spend your money, in the hopes of having a good time.  But alas, with decibel as with my horrible mistake, you quickly learn that the hassles outweigh the initial upside.One thing I do love about Decibel: the understated exterior.  All that marks the entrance is a small wooden sign with "decibel" emblazoned in tiny black letters, which sits atop a cramped metal staircase, which leads to the front door.  If you don't already know where you're going, or don't have someone who does, then you could walk up and down the block a few times trying to find the place.  Trs chic.Once you make it inside, it still seems like you can't possibly be in the right place.  The foyer is so small that it becomes uncomfortable with more than five or six people, and you can't see any indication of the larger restaurant that lies beyond, except an unimpressive doorway that leads into a cramped, dark hallway.  But you can't get to the doorway just yet, you have to wait behind the hilariously-out-of-place-looking velvet rope.Once you make it past the rope and into the inner sanctum... err, dining room, you'll be shown to a table meant for a party half the size of yours.  My ex was crazy about the lychee-tinis; I stuck with the saki.  Their selection was truly impressive-seeming, but I'm easily impressed, since I'm a gaijin through-and-through and therefore I can barely tell the difference between a sh*tty hot sake and a $100 bottle of the good stuff.It's worth checking out once, especially if you go on an off night when you won't have to wait behind the rope and suffer through miserable service.  Also, if you really know your saki, then you;ll probably have a greater appreciation for their selection than I did.
Brian S.}Oakland, CA}80}84}12}-1}5}1/16/2007}Nothing like unprotected Saki in this place...No you're not going to visit the super about the scabies in your shower. You're going into one sick den of the EV Japanese underground. And yes, they even let white boys in. Sure it's a little surly, maze like, dank, and at times a bit like the Mos Eisley cantina in Star Wars but where else are you likely to be yelled at by hot and fat Japanese women who throw home style tidbits at you across a counter?As if that were not enough for you to transgress your current relationship, they then pour quantities of Saki from multiple pretty bottles down your throat for hours.A constant refrain uttered repeatedly from the lips of our attendant: "This one a little drier!"  As one who recently moved from NYC to SF this is one of the places that I miss the most. A legend of a place I tell you... and of you panty wipes who complain of the service. You have no idea how jealous I am of you bitches right now...
T M.}NY, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}1/2/2007}Good:Nice selection of Sake, most of the times they play great music. Some dishes are quite nice too.Bad:  Space, small and cramped, no good for large groups. Staff has a lousy attitude with regards to customers, almost as if they are doing patrons a big favor by serving people in such an 'ultra exclusive' spot. That mean's they do anything from clapping for attention instead of just saying 'excuse me', harassing patrons for more tips!  Nice place but staff need to understand that a tip is a tip, it's not a mandatory payment especially when the service leaves much to be desired.
Shiho F.}Carmel by the Sea, CA}4968}2835}2447}-1}4}12/6/2006}Sic underground sake bar.  Don't forget to hit up the takoyaki stand next door!
Jen D.}Berlin, Germany}268}1481}274}-1}4}12/5/2006}I never knew this place existed until a few weeks ago but I love it. The sake menu is extensive, and there's other stuff for those who aren't into sake so much. I've never had much off of the food menu except crackers and edamame. This is usually 2nd or 3rd stop for me so the only thing I want to fill my already full belly with is sake.  I love the very dark atmosphere. I had one of those magical first dates here. :)It's only getting 4 stars because of the choice in music. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. It's never consistent, I'll tell you that.
Emily B.}Brooklyn, NY}15}16}0}-1}4}11/26/2006}Unlike probably the majority of reviewers here, I don't even drink sake but Decibel has become an East Village staple for me in the past year. The lychee martini is incredibly strong and sweet and all the more satisfying when coupled with warm, salty edamame or shrimp shumai.  The vegetable noodle soup dish on the menu is really a variation of basic chicken noodle type soup (sans chicken), but is still tasty, filling (quite large for $8) and perfect for a cold night. I've never had a problem there described by any of the other Yelpers, but I do try to get there early on the weekends before it gets mobbed.
Kimberli M.}New York, NY}124}422}156}-1}4}11/12/2006}Over the years I've had a few first dates here. I've never had a bad experience... but perhaps it's because my dates both spoke Japanese and new their fair share about sake.It's a good first date place that allows a sake afficiando to show his stuff. It's the best sake bar I've found in the US... Now if we were inTokyo...
Jean H.}New York, NY}23}129}17}-1}4}10/12/2006}it's small, so crowded, loud, and underground. but it has a gazillion kinds of sake, in a good range of prices, decent food menu (haven't really tried the food yet though), and best of all, awesome awesome music playing in their sound system. my friends and i just ordered an $8 bottle of decent sake, which had enough for several shots between the three of us, a $3 bowl of edamame, and shrimp chips. not bad for manhattan, is what i say. if you're in the right mood, this makes for a great "get pissed and chat passionately for hours and be completely oblivious to everyone around you while tapping your foot to the beat" kinda place. update: udon is very good.
Natalia K.}Oakland, CA}35}716}55}-1}5}10/3/2006}The wait on a Friday/Saturday night is LONG. Weekdays are quieter and low-key.  Recommended sake: Dassai, Biho, Tomoju, (although I'm not a sake expert) and of course lychee martinis. The staff is decent except for this one guy who swears Decibel is ultra exclusive. Just ignore him. I've never been "chased" for not tipping enough so im assuming 20% is safe.  Do not go with big groups because #1 there is no space, #2 they will not even bother checking if there are any seats available.It's sak-e, not sak-i. Short vowels.
Judith G.}New York, NY}494}245}66}-1}3}9/25/2006}Oh. A Sake Bar. Sounds like a fun concept.   I had to see what the fuss was all about. And I thought my cousin would find it fun and unusual. I had a pleasant time. Almost.  Having said that, let's get some things straight. Yes, Decibel is 'cozy,' it's uber-hip, it's underground, (figuratively and literally), it's hot, (as in not enough a/c), and it is really full of 'beautiful,' cool people who seem to have been around the world seeking to recapture some favorite, hole-in-the-wall, not-in-the-guide-books type of place they fell in love with during their travels. The decor is funky, in a perfectly, transparently crafted let's- make- believe-it's-authenticl kind of way. I don't know much about sake - and though the unfiltered one I had that night was very clean and nice - I am not sure that it mattered to me all that much.  So, unless you are very knowledgeable about your sake or an afficiando, don't even try to decipher what to order.  I also think I should have listened to the other Yelpers and tried the lychee martini - but I was too caught up in the moment to remember.   ANYWAY.... At the end of the day, for me, the experience at Decibel  came down to the ambience and other intangibles. We negotiated and descended the rickety stairs to a very intimate and hip, bar area.  (Beware. There is an extra curb step before you enter, on which you might easily trip.)    This place is full of (too) cute little tricks which some might find  endearing and some annoying. For one, the rope which wasn't velvet was nevertheless off-putting, if not outright pretentious in its perverse and reverse anti-snobbism that nontheless failed to disguise the heart of it's ambition to be above it all..   The menacing (he thought) and humorless guy maning the rough-hewn rope didn't help, either.  Would it have seriously hurt  him to crack a smile at my joke about the rope not being 'velvet'?  (His unspoken message was clearly 'we are a very seriously hip place.  Too serious for jokes.'  It would be like breaking the fourth wall.  A no-no. But I wasn't at all intimidated, as hard as they tried, maybe because I am such a voyeour in life.  I am extra tolerant and open to experiene something totally different. But something else ruined the night for me. It was when we left.  The waitress chased my cousin to the exit door and demanded that he double her tip.  I should have drawn the line, and if I hadn't had a few sakes, there would have been major words - if not claws.  For starters, maybe these people need to look up the meaning of TIP. Decibel is far too expensive for the 'cool' and 'underground' type of place it is trying soooo hard to be.  Get real.  Since when do I have to pay a premium for semi-decadence and grittiness that is 'created,' not found?  Maybe I'm crazy, but at this point, buying a bottle of sake at any corner liqour store and drinking it out of a paper bag in any downtown rat-ridden park would be more exciting.  Except nobody would be there to SEE you.   And that is the whole point of being at Decibel. They typify the times we live in.  It's part of the Disneyfication of reality mixed with Andy Warhol's fifteen-minutes of fame, times one thousand.  I don't know why I am having such a strong reaction to this - but something in my gut tells me I'm not alone in missing authentic seediness when you most want it. The thing that saved the place was the couple at the table next to us.  Their conversation was erudite. They were In their early twenties and wiser than most people.  The girl was the most beautiful and sweetest person I have encountered in many years in NYC.  Her boyfriend was from Scotland and he regaled us with stories of his trips in the UK.  I suppose I could have found them walking in any park, with my paper bag full of sake, if I tried. But I doubt it.  A place like Decibe does draw its share of interesting people you might not otherwise meet.  It's too bad (it's hard to meet them otherwise, these days.)  Decibel is also, at first glance, the kind of place you dream about finding when you travel off-the beaten path.  But, sadly, sometimes first impressions lie.   Their attitude was all about the bottom line.  Such a shame.    They get three stars for the physical atmosphere. In reality, the waitress demanding an extra tip should land them outside the limits of the acceptable, without any merit or value whatsoever. I am never coming back, either.
Kim D.}Cambridge, MA}106}232}15}-1}4}9/10/2006}This is a great bar to hit up later in the night, when you've had a few drinks and really are starting to feel the city coursing through your veins.  When you descend the stairs into Decibel you'll probably need to wait, but while you do so you feel like you're in-the-know, not of an exclusive, expensive spot, but of one of those truly cool bars that have their atmosphere just right.  When you finally get in, you'll be surprised by all the tiny tables in the back room.  Sure, the service is not friendly, but it is prompt, bringing you your sake, edamame, or rice crackers before you know it.  Decibel has the best lychee martinis I've ever had (I totally agree with Margot F., you'll dream about them).  Maybe others are stuck outside waiting, but the servers leave you alone to have your  intimate conversations.  Decibel's definitely got the speakeasy feel down.
Brock T.}New York, NY}20}20}0}-1}4}9/7/2006}It's a good first date place because it's intimate and dark, and thus it's hard to accurately gauge how much of your sake has been drained.  Best to go with someone who actually knows something about sake though, since you can't expect much help from the staff.  Also, plan on tripping alot on your way out.
Abhay K.}San Francisco, CA}8}36}0}-1}5}8/29/2006}This is the kind of place to go with a group of good friends who all enjoy sake and sake-based drinks. It's a hole in the wall so you can impress all your out-of-town friends. This basement bar is really tiny when you enter but once you find your way into the seating area, you see it open up; okay, maybe not that much. It's still pretty small back there too. Everytime my old group of friends from college come together, we try to go to Decibel as it is one of our regular spots.
Vi N.}Dallas, TX}391}17}0}-1}4}8/27/2006}Decibel is small, cozy and hip without that hipper than thou vibe that would make anyone too uncomfortable stepping in for the first time.  I would warn anyone that has had a bit too much sake to drink to have a friend help you navigate the mildly hazardous terrain of the restaurant, there are a few small steps and unexpected drop offs that may leave you with a sprained ankle on top of that horrendous hangover the next day.  I would recommend this place for smaller groups 2-4 max as the tables and booths only accommodate so many.  The service was excellent; the wait staff was charming and helpful.  I would recommend the Rihaku sake if you like something a little more on the sweet side, I've always been a fan of unfiltered sake.  And the wasabi pork dumplings and the shrimp and bamboo wrapped in tofu are absolutely incredible.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in NYC.
Amy W.}New York, NY}51}70}8}-1}3}8/23/2006}A tiny space, but got a GREAT vibe. Whether it's walking down that rickety flight of stairs flanked by garbage, being ushered into a dingy, dimly lit room or cramming into tiny booths, it's a great time. Or perhaps it's just the SAKE. The mochi is actually pretty good as well.
Josiah L.}New York, NY}71}155}35}-1}5}8/2/2006}best sake bar i've ever been in this country (but then again, i've never been to the west coast), never had a bad service there, except maybe a few times i had to let other people go first even though i was first in line, probably because i was the only one there waiting for a 4-6 people table on a weekend =P
Marykay F.}Brooklyn, NY}12}32}0}-1}5}6/14/2006}Yep, it's a hipster hangout.  But I love it.  In addition to the lengthy sake menu, it's all about the amosphere...or lack of it.  Always reliable.
Carrie G.}Toronto, Canada}5}14}0}-1}4}6/13/2006}It has been awhile since I last visited the Sake Bar but it was an incredible time. A very intimate setting and an excellent place to bring a "serious" date
Paul H.}Flushing, NY}93}9}0}-1}5}5/27/2006}great sake, great atmosphere, great prices.... what NY is all about!!! Not some trendy bar trying to make a name a place that goes by word of mouth more then anything! This place has such a great ambiance it has gotten to me write a review for it it was that good. The only thing it could have more of is mroe food but then it would loose some of it's small place appeal.
Katie Q.}Philadelphia, PA}80}204}0}-1}5}4/27/2006}they must do something right here because i haven't actually had a drink here in 5 years but i try to go several times throughout the course of a year only to be clotheslined by the velvet rope....yet i always return.  maybe its the speakeasy feel of descending those stairs while your friends wonder "where is she going, that couldn't possibly be a public establishment" only to watch their faces register that i know something they don't.  alas i lose my cool status at that damned rope but oh yes, i will be back and i will save face, and i will have my sakitini...if its the last thing i do.
Val U.}Portland, OR}6}113}1}-1}5}4/25/2006}Best way to take a quick trip to Tokyo.  Too bad I live in SF and it's a long plane ride either way...
Eric H.}Oakland, CA}6}45}0}-1}5}4/14/2006}Went there with my girlfriend sometime after 9pm this past Sunday, so there was none of the hussle and bustle - and hassle to get in - as some of the other reviewers mentioned.. which was awesome!  We sat quickly, and ordered some sake, again, quickly.  The rustic Japanese food (for example: no sushi) came next - new and deliscious for me; many small plates added up to a satiating meal.   The music started off with some downtempo-ish electronica and moved its way into classic jazz over the night, perfect for the hushed, half-empty crowd and very hushed lighting.  More sake flowed.  Next time I go back, I'll be bringing friends to expand my options for sampling.. yum!
Henry S.}Cary, NC}102}114}190}-1}5}3/12/2006}This was the third stop on a first date and, although I love this place, I was impressed how much she liked it too.  The snug feeling gives it an intimate scene.  Though usually crowded, the music and the conversations around you are never too loud.  The serving staff was kind and helpful in making suggestions in selecting a bottle of cold sake.  They encouraged us to contribute to the already massive writing on the wall.  They were quick to seat and serve us.
lee c.}Malvern, PA}27}110}0}-1}5}2/20/2006}probably one of the awesomest atmosphere's i've experienced to date. this place reminds me so much of japan that i felt i was almost in a dream and tried to speak my broken japanese to the server. (a miserable failure). the sake selection is like a beer selection at a renowned german beer haus or something like that. and overall i had a wonderful time.
Taishi T.}New York, NY}88}121}26}-1}1}2/9/2006}A horrible place.  I posted this review when I was young and innocent.  Now the true face of the devil has shone through.  A place that gets too big for it's britches an begins to treat their long time returning customers with the grace of a rabid bulldog who hasn't eaten for years.  They were exceptionally rude when we ordered a drink and were not please with the result.  Living in Japan, albeit sometime ago, when you order a Chu-hai, it does not mean sochu, soda water and a pickled plum.  I remember a sweet drink with shochu and you would specify soda if you wanted that.  They refused to change the order and wanted to charge us.  We asked to see the manager, and the very rude wait staff member barked and said that I should get him myself.  The manager came over and repeated the same rude behavior and told us if we don't like it we should leave.  I have been coming here for over 5 years, and I am disappointed that they would treat anyone with such disrespect.  I guess customers are a commodity that they can burn bridges with.  I will never recommend Decibel and will never go back to this establishment ever again.  They have lost a loyal customer forever.  To bad...
shaun l.}San Francisco, CA}103}271}10}-1}4}2/2/2006}This is a GREAT place to drink some sake, have some salty japanese snacks, and just shoot the shit. Small, darkish, and cool.
Matthew R.}New York, NY}30}13}0}-1}4}1/4/2006}Great basement sake bar with a punk rock feeling, but avoid it on the weekends during the school year when it's overrun with NYU students.  Has snacks available as well, but the real attraction is the large selection of sake.
K. X.}Portland, OR}19}88}24}-1}5}1/3/2006}Dark, small space, but with a ton of gritty charm and more sake to choose from than you'll know what to do with.  My personal favorite is Himezen.  It is a chilled sake that has a taste completely unique from any other kind I have ever sampled.  There are not many sake bars that carry Himezen, which is also another reason why I love this place.  To me, it is a great date spot because it is small and intimate, and on any given night it will be loud and boisterous, or quiet and relaxed.  I have spent many good nights with my friends filling up on sake and shu mai.  If you're more uppity than willing to have a good time and try out a new spot, then Decibel is not for you, but if you're a true new yorker, you know that some of the best gems you'll find will be 'hole in the wall' type of places, and for me Decibel is among my top 10.
Anthro Food E.}New York, NY}46}419}0}-1}5}1/2/2006}if youre a sake snob, this lil underground (literally) hole in the wall bar will quench your thirst!  they have really good nosh that will satisfy your tastebuds as well so you wont get too drunk while trying to climb the narrow stairs on your way out...
Stellah D.}New York, NY}155}365}118}-1}3}9/15/2005}It's loud, it's hot, and it's underground.  It was also full of some of the most beautiful people I've ever seen. The food was good, the sake was great, and that night, it was just perfect. I'll probably never return.
Margot F.}Ann Arbor, MI}31}53}0}-1}4}7/22/2005}Walking into decibel is like walking into a kung fu movie.  As if at any moment, the gorgeous, kimonoed waitresses may whip out katana and garnish your lychee martini with the limbs of an unruly customer.Not unlike the film genre, Decibel ranges from brain-crushingly awful to suprisingly great.  Sometimes, by which I mean on weekdays, the service is friendly, you can sit immediately and enjoy a great bottle of sake or too many lychee martinis with edamame and shrimp dumplings and have a cozy, unique, impress-the-guests with your manhattan prowess or magical-first-date kind of night.Other times, by which I mean on weekends, they practically pat you down on your way in, if you're wiling to wait behind the entry rope for a table and then remind you half a dozen times about the $8/person minimum, get your drink orders wrong, argue with you about it and chase you out the door demanding a larger tip and threatening not to let you in again.  So much potential, so often wasted.  When it's great, there's nothing like it: a dark little basement sake bar with more ambiance than you can swallow and lychee martinis I still dream about.  But when it's bad, it's an extremely expensive mistake.

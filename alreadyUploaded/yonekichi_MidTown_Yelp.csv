Arthur J.}Miami, FL}0}13}1}-1}5}4/21/2018}I've had rice burgers in Taiwan and Japan. This place nails it. I LOVE their hot lemon ginger tea on a cold day. Their "furi furi" fries (meaning fries that are shaken in a bag with flavored salt) are quite good and made with fresh potatoes. Our waitresses was very helpful and put a smile on my face.
Lisa P.}New York, NY}0}11}8}-1}1}3/30/2018}I waited 30 minutes for a basic order of curry in an empty restaurant. Rather than noticing I had been waiting an unusually long time, I had to confront the waitress who took zero responsibility for her mistakes. The table was dirty and curry stained which gives you a clue at the standard of cleanliness here.
Liz S.}New York, NY}636}530}1003}18}4}3/23/2018}It's a lazy Friday, so I had time to check out Yonekichi today for lunch. It's a quick walk over from the Times Square area, on a stretch of 9th Ave. The dining room is small but surprisingly classy and peaceful for a fast-casual place. They also seem to share the space with a curry place as they had a second menu of lunch curry sets in addition to their main offering: rice burgers.Rice burgers are not that similar to burgers, but if the name fits... It's more of a palm-sized sandwich with toasted rice cakes serving as buns for your choice of filling. I went for the Tsukune Chicken ($8) rice burger combo with hiji-quinoa ($3 in the combo, $4 on its own). I also had an iced maple matcha drink which is free with a Yelp check-in.I ordered to-go, and it took much longer than expected-- over 15 minutes. That was with only a couple of other groups present around 1 pm, none of whom appeared to be waiting on food, so timing seemed a little off to me. If I were to come again, I would place an order online and come pick up.The rice burger itself was pretty good. Despite its small size, it was quite filling. The rice didn't hold structural integrity towards the end, but it was also soaking in the sauce on my walk back to work. The chicken meatball patty wasn't the most flavorful but was solid; I liked where it met with the scallions and shishito pepper.The hiji-quinoa, though healthy and tasty, is embarrassingly small. Skip it. The maple matcha drink was actually amazing-- high quality and generous matcha without the bitterness, and a perfectly calibrated amount of sweetness. Highly recommended.I would gladly come back again to try out another rice burger, though I think next time I would order ahead if I were in a rush. Burdock fries and soups also look compelling. A good change of pace for a workday lunch.
Lucien A.}Brooklyn, NY}171}61}76}18}4}3/17/2018}Cool Hand Lu says:  Great for a quick bite to go or a sit down plate of curry.I had wanted to check out this location for curry-ya since I've been to the one in the Village a few times already.  It's good to know that they have the curry as well as the rice burgers.  The location is not very big but it's not overly cramped either.  It fits about 16 people comfortably so it's good for you and a couple of friends or just a small group.  It's very clean and neat and usually what I would expect from a Japanese styled restaurant.  Seeing some origami cranes was also a nice touch.My go to so far is the Japanese classic.  It has beef, along with pumpkin, red peppers, potatoes and string beans. I got the extra vegetables this time and was happy to see that mushrooms came with it, as mushrooms are a favorite of mine.  Are usually get a Sapporo with my meal but this time I just got some of the roasted green tea.  The tea was really hot which is how I like it but I had to let it cool off since the teacups don't have handles.  The server was very nice and attentive and followed the known level of hospitality seen in a Japanese restaurant.When asked for my desired level of spiciness for the curry I said I wanted it to be hot.  I am nowhere near being a veteran within the spices and pepper world but this was nowhere near even remotely spicy for me.  That's the only reason for not giving 5 stars.All in all, the meal was great and hit the spot. I also enjoyed hearing ska playing while eating.  I'll have to go try the other locations now.
Estelle Z.}New York, NY}184}83}268}18}5}3/5/2018}Keep coming back for their rice burgers: salmon, chicken, beef are all great! Side dishes: favorites are shishito, potato wedges, spicy chicken skewers is 5-star! They now also have the dishes as the curry-ya in east village! Great curry katsu, curry on a sizzling pan, traditional curry!Yum!Minor tip: if you like spicy go for the spicy/extra:) Medium isn't spicy at all
Sonny U.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}2/27/2018}The portions are ridiculously tiny for an incredibly high price.You can spend $20 on lunch and then decide to spend another 20 to slowly fill up with the tiny but OK tasting bites available at the shop.Or go get a real meal.
Chris J.}Jersey City, NJ}0}6}0}-1}5}2/23/2018}Got takeout lunch from this place and ordered the Sukiyaki rice burger with a sunny-side egg along with their Soba Cha (buckwheat tea). I've had rice burgers in the past and mostly all of them the rice patty would just fall apart. Here though, the burger was very delicious. The rice patty didn't fall apart at all. The wait is not short but IMO definitely worth the wait! Will definitely come back and try other burgers!
Indi A.}Jamaica, Queens, NY}0}4}2}-1}4}12/21/2017}Small yet tasty. I had the lotus root burger (forgot the Japanese name), miso soup, and green tea. Everything was deliciously flavorful. The lotus root was crisp yet very tender. The miso had bits of grated citrus for added flavor (yum!). Green tea was piping hot. The young ladies behind the counter were very pleasant. They  recommended the ginger pork burger but I went off the beaten path and was not disappointed.  Its cozy inside (not much seating) - i think there were maybe 3 small tables.I ate "to stay" on a very cold, blustery evening when i needed something warm 'n' toasty to melt away the pre-winter blues.
Tina C.}New York, NY}0}1}3}-1}4}12/12/2017}I was craving for rich burger and was so glad that I found this gem! The size of the burger is a bit small, especially for guys, but it's about the same size as a MOS Burger so I had no complaints. I actually think the rice patty was better here because the chef made it when we placed our orders. I added the chicken meatball soup as a combo for $2.50 and I must say that it was a great value, not some diluted miso soup that you get at fake Japanese restaurants. Overall, the food was great. I'd definitely come back again. I think I'd make this my go-to for pre-show since it's a quick bite and very close to the theater district. The place probably only seats 10 but the atmosphere was cozy and very Japanese.
Danielle B.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}308}131}6}18}4}10/31/2017}Got takeaway lunch from this place through meal pal and really loved the concept.  Its a pseudo-burger place, but all the burgers have an Asian spin.  I had the chicken burger with a sweet sauce, ginger and shishito peppers.  Would have liked more shishito peppers because YUM, but I understand it would hurt the practicality of the hand-held burger.  I honestly don't care about rice, but the rice buns was really nice.  I understand how people could complain about it being messy, but with a little care it wasn't at all.  Really though, the highlight was the jazzed up miso soup.  It had a bit of spice added to it, which was awesome AND there were small shavings of lemon peel in it.  It gave a really nice brightness to the soup.  Again I don't usually love miso soup, but I believe in this.  Will definitely be back.
Vanessa W.}New York, NY}412}108}218}18}4}10/27/2017}After reading the reviews here, I honestly expected the burgers to be smaller and messier. I was pleasantly surprised that the rice buns held together nicely enough and, though small, the burgers were filling enough when ordered as a signature combo (comes with furi furi wedge-cut fries with your choice of flavoring and a beverage of your choice). I had room for dessert and was able to try their mochi ice cream as well.If you want to only have rice burgers to fill up, you can order multiple, and you'll be on your way to a free one! They have a stamp card for a free rice burger after purchase of 10 rice burgers.I had the ginger pork rice burger which was delicious. Although the pork slices were thin, they were flavorful and complimented the rice buns and lettuce well. My boyfriend's avo-eel rice burger (which for some reason isn't listed on all the menus, but is on the menu on the counter by the register and available to order) was pretty decent, but not as delicious as the ginger pork.The yuzu ginger lemonade was refreshing and unlike other lemonades you may have had. They have an iced and hot version of the yuzu ginger drink; we got the iced version. Note: the iced versions are also larger than the hot versions.The yuzu salt furi furi fries had a unique flavor I haven't had with fries before. The check in offer also allows you to get another small serving of furi furi fries - limited to wasabi flavoring; if you're not as big of a fan of wasabi, like me, or if you want to control how much wasabi flavoring comes across on the fries, you can also ask for the flavoring on the side! This goes for all the flavorings.The mochi ice cream is served on a stick in servings of two. You can pick just one flavor or two to try more of their flavors! Between my boyfriend and I, we tried all the mochi ice cream flavors available besides the green tea one: raspberry white chocolate, double chocolate, mango basil, and black sesame. They were all really good but I'd have to say the top 3 are black sesame (for a more traditional taste) and raspberry white chocolate and mango basil (for a sweeter, fruitier taste).Definitely down to come by this place again!
Junye H.}New York, NY}279}13}5}-1}4}10/22/2017}The burgers here are pretty unique (the buns are made of rice)! It's fun to try, the portions are a bit small. The restaurant is fairly small too, but it's incredibly clean with polished wood furniture and crane decorations from the ceiling.
Billy S.}London, United Kingdom}82}122}171}18}4}10/1/2017}Stopped in for a quick snack while I was waiting for my table at Pure Thai down the street. It was a nice surprise. I didn't get a chance to try the rice burger, but it looked great. I had the peppers, the potato wedges with yuzu salt, and an iced maple matcha. All were so good. The matcha was refreshing with a nice touch of sweetness. Loved it and I need to come back to try the rice burger.
Daniyar T.}Manhattan, NY}30}16}4}-1}5}9/21/2017}Went to Yonekichi for lunch today and was rather impressed. I always pass by but never go in (probably because it is a very small door that is easy to dismiss). I was curious about a rice burger. Ordered a chicken burger with miso soup and quinoa salad + ginger lemonade. OMG the lemonade and the burger were fantastic! It may be a tad of a small portion but it tastes good, you want more! Miso soup is like everywhere, same with quinoa salad. Very neat!
Henry L.}New York, NY}0}17}2}-1}5}9/10/2017}Great service, fantastic food. Highly recommend the scrumptious sukiyaki burger and the refreshing yuzu lemonade. The seasonal miso soup is tasty as well. Can't wait to try the other burgers.
Cubalicious P.}New York, NY}3}20}1}-1}3}9/6/2017}The sides are better than the rice burgers which are actually difficult to eat as the rice crumbles. Their chicken skewers are also delicious and the atmosphere in the restaurant is alright as well
Panyia C.}Manhattan, NY}12}31}21}-1}4}8/28/2017}Got the suki burger with yuzu drink. Portions are a little too small but they're tasty.
Tamar K.}New York, NY}245}251}1278}-1}4}8/26/2017}The sign definitely stopped me in my tracks. An ALL GLUTEN FREE restaurant?! Yay! That's heaven for a gluten free person like me. And there didn't seem to be any dairy either. Even their fried food is gluten free. So cool! Their place is cute, the food was decent, and although the portions are a little small, I was still full from my meal package. I will definitely go back and try some other things.
Risa H.}Brooklyn, NY}169}158}210}18}3}7/26/2017}Something to try!  Found this place via Yelp and ordered the Tsukune Burger with the Burdock Fries and the Yuzu Ginger Lemonade.  I wish the portion sizes were bigger, they had two of the chicken burger patties instead of one, or the prices were cheaper.  As previous Yelpers mentioned, it does fall apart easily, so make sure to use the wrapper when eating.  $13 card minimum here, service was quick, place was clean.
Maria M.}San Francisco, CA}1515}277}1996}18}4}7/3/2017}Be prepared to get your hands dirty since these burgers though delicious are very messy to eat. My favorite food truck in SF serves rice burgers so I had to try this place. Everything is made to order:  Sukiyaki Burger - thinly sliced beef Salmon Rice Burger Tsukune Burger - Chicken meatball pattyGinger Pork Burger -  ginger soy sauce gave it kickThe rice patties could be a little more crisp to hold everything together but it still tastes great. Impressive mix of flavors, each rice burger has a complex taste. So delicious! It's not easy to eat on the go so eat it at the restaurant or at home with plenty of napkins.  Lastly don't forget to try the ice cream mochi dessert it is the perfect palette cleanser.
Paydor L.}Washington, DC}0}5}0}-1}5}6/22/2017}The rice burgers were delicious! We had the tofu ganmo and ginger pork burgers. The taste and seasonings for the burgers were well balanced, and the rice was wonderfully browned and crispy. We also had the iced maple matcha tea and soba tea. They were both refreshing and not too sweet!It's always a plus when a Japanese-food store is run by actual Japanese - you know it'll be good and authentic.
Dolls P.}Tarzana, CA}4}51}5}-1}4}4/22/2017}Place is so cute and love the rice burger concept! I had the salmon one and it was delicious
Derrick R.}ELMHURST, NY}0}9}0}-1}2}3/30/2017}small  portion and pricey hope they either lower the price or increase the portion size
Michelle L.}NY, NY}145}48}227}-1}3}3/23/2017}Slow service, good food with decent combo pricesGot the tsukune (chicken) burger with sunny side up egg, (combo: furi furi fries and a maple Matcha tea for +$4). Portions are kinda small, so this is a good snack. Order took 30 minutes, and they forgot my egg :/They also have cold brew from HI Collar
Andrea L.}Newark, DE}0}12}1}-1}4}3/11/2017}The ingredients were so fresh and you can taste it! We got ginger pork and sukiyaki beef with shishito (not spicy pepper) and white miso soup. I thought shishito and soup really made the meal worth the visit!
Jessie L.}New York, NY}202}15}14}-1}4}3/8/2017}The burger is good but the size is too small for dinner. Recommend to have a two burger combo.
James M.}Manhattan, NY}217}11}0}-1}2}3/3/2017}2/28/17 though delicous and healthy, portions were meager and small. Had a 16.06 meal then had to order yet another.
Sohail A.}Brooklyn, NY}36}81}1}-1}3}2/26/2017}If you're hungry, then this is not the place for you. The burger is like a tiny snack - not a meal. It's funny though because it COSTS as much as an actual meal. There's a dollar pizza place right next door and I had to get 2 slices afterwards, just to feel like I ate something. I also had to take a star off for poor service. There was absolutely no one inside when my two friends and I walked in. I ordered something very simple with a drink. After 15 minutes, we all had our meals - save my drink. I walked 5 feet over to the counter and politely asked for the drink. The cashier/server asked me for my receipt so she could be sure "that you paid for it". Really? A grown adult male is going to try to scam this empty restaurant out of a single drink? The restaurant was still empty when we walked out.
Daniel P.}Queens, NY}73}1}0}-1}5}2/26/2017}My girlfriend and I were going to Ippudo Ramen, but it was packed to the brim. So we found Yonechiki and we love it here Their rice burgers are amazing and their varieties of flavored fries give your mouth a kickI'd recommend this place to anyone, whether it's a date night, friends' night out or you just need something to eat
Stephanie L.}Flushing, NY}525}9}3}-1}5}2/18/2017}The ebi-tem burger was so yummy! Portion size it might be a bit small but the ambiance of the space and the nice owners make up for it. The miso soup had enoki mushrooms in it which made it really unique in my opinion. Come here for good food but it might be a bit pricey.
Kristi A.}Honolulu, HI}111}186}306}18}4}2/17/2017}Tip: Use the wrapper they give you, things got really messy when I didn't.lol Interior: It's a very small place, but very clean and comfortable. Food: I got the Tsukune Chicken and it was pretty good. I liked the fries better which had a Japanese salt and pepper seasoning on. The rice paddy for the Tsukune chicken was crunchy, but due to the sauce for the chicken, it fell apart quickly making eating it with your bare hands difficult. I recommend eating it for the wrapper. The burger itself was small and the servings for their potato wedges was small too. The total came out to be $12 without a drink. I would come here again, but I wished their serving size was bigger.
Steven Y.}Singapore, Singapore}1}13}381}-1}4}2/11/2017}Good for snack, not for those with big appetite, portions were small. Big eater can easily down 2-3 portions.... Had the sukiyaki burger with soba cha and wasabi furi furi.The burger was nice, lightly flavored. Kind of similar to mos burger in Japan. Wasabi furi furi was also good. Very small place which only seats 14.
Alex N.}Huntington Beach, CA}68}50}0}-1}5}2/10/2017}This place is really good. Good portions and courteous staff. The food is healthy and affordable. I was thoroughly impressed. The rice patties are good with the lightly seasoned chicken patty.  Go and try this place out.
Tom G.}Rutherford, NJ}164}217}2217}-1}4}2/5/2017}Yeah Yeah , I know you haven't herd from me for months now, well I was living in another reality where would you believed that Putin selected a con man as our President and he stuff his cabinet full of swamp scum, a nightmare like that would wake up the dead.Well the first thing I see is Yonekichi from 9th street, Astor Place where I ate my first burger with buns made of compressed rice.  Unlike the whole in the wall place downtown this place is a small but is a nice sit down restaurant.The menu is similar to there other spot with the descriptions and pictures of the burgers;Sukiyaki - thinly-sliced beef, onion, lettuce, togarashi threadsUnagi - bbq eel, avocado, tempura flakes, shredded egg crepeSaikyo Salmon - kyoto-style miso salmon, pickled daikon radish, shiso, sakura-misoKakiage - onion-kale-carrot mixed tempura, shiso, Akoh saltKinpira - sautéed lotus root, carrot, sesame seed, togarashi threadsGinger Pork which replaces the Ginger Mugifuj downtown -  thinly-sliced all naturaql Sakura pork shoulder , lettuce, ginger soy sauceTsukune - chicken meatball patty, shishito pepper, Tokyo scallionBut I wanted to try more of the burgers so I also ordered Saikyo Salmon, Tsukune Chicken and a new one the Ginger Pork, with sides of Yonekichi Furi Fries - Potato Wadges, with Wasbi Salt, Yuzu salt.Now this is not the Shake Shack so the food is good but not great. but I was only disappointed on the Saikyo Salmon because is tasted too fishy and the Wasbi salt fries was better and the Yuzu ones.The beef, pork and chicken where a little tasty but could use more bang. And if you look at my photos you could see they will not be on the cover of Bon Appétit. It will be a while before I be back I will wait till when I start missing those rice buns.
daphne r.}New York, NY}2}5}2}-1}1}2/4/2017}Decided to try this place for lunch. Not a fan. Very bland food. Now I know why it's always empty. Can't imagine it will stay open when there are much better options in the neighborhood.
Ale P.}San Diego, CA}0}37}0}-1}4}2/2/2017}Delicious burgers made out of rice. A little sloppy and a bit pricey but they're worth trying out.
Kenny C.}New York, NY}353}219}389}-1}5}12/30/2016}Yay rice burgers. They use rice instead of flour bunsThe space is really clean and warm. Think ski lodge or cabin in the woods.Seating for around 14Staff are really friendly Salmon burger was quite good, salmon was juicy and cooked perfectly and surprisingly substantial in size Shishito peppers were good, as was the chicken meatball soup Cucumber pickle on a stick was very crisp and refreshingWill be back!
Pete T.}Manhattan, NY}118}1}0}-1}5}12/30/2016}Unlike the location in the village, everything here is gluten-free. Tasty combos (pork and chicken with the egg are my favorite), and the fries with the different salt options are great. Good lunch spot. Eat in, as the burgers tend to lose a bit of the crunch if you have them delivered.
Rebecca H.}New York, NY}21}49}489}-1}4}12/22/2016}Will the rice burger be as big a fad as the ramen burger craze?? If it does, it'll trace its way back to this joint. I only sampled the Tsukune/Chicken rice burger: compact patties of sticky rice form the "bun", and in between is a delicious and juicy piece of yakitori-style chicken meatball. Smothered in an unidentifiable sauce, the meat arouses tastes of garlic and barbecue, enhanced by a few pieces of scallion. The Tsukune and rice rip off harmoniously with one mouthful, and the slightly sweet and mild taste of sticky rice is pleasantly accented by a complexity of meaty flavors. My only gripe here is the size to price ratio; it's disappointingly tiny and thus bit pricey for something so small. I know you'll be paying for the type and quality of meat, but don't expect to be full after just one. Regardless, Yonekichi left a verryyy positive first impression, and I'm definitely returning to try out the others. The space, on the other hand, is perfectly proportional to the size of the food. It's tiny, probably 15 people max at a time? That might even be a bit generous. It's clean, tidy, minimalistic, kawaii - everything you'd expect from a Japanese eatery. As one of the newest additions to the endless blocks of food choices on 9th ave, I highly recommend you pop in for a snack. Or try out 3 and make it a meal.
ここなつ}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}1}-1}4}12/4/2016}I ate a Tsukube burger. It was good. But lil small and I couldn't satisfied.Package and bag is cute..!

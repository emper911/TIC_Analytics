Luis R.}Teaneck, NJ}4}49}3}-1}5}5/1/2018}I am new to the foodie scene but this has been by far, the best ramen I have ever had.  Pork was flavorful and tender. The broth was spicy goodness and awesome.   Noodles had good bite and retained its texture. Can't wait to go back.
Brian H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}12}47}5}-1}5}4/29/2018}I love this place. If dining in, you will notice that it is a small space, but it is never crowded. That is because most people get delivery. The staff is ok, not too friendly. The atmosphere is nice, as it feels like a nice asian restaurant. The main reason I give it 5 stars is because of the taste. The food is just amazing! The karaage is what always gets to me. Pair that with fried rice and kimchi, and you have a nice meal. I can't stop talking about how good the food is to my friends. The menu can get a little pricey, but I would say that it is worth it. I have heard that sometimes they mess up the take out, but I have never had any problems with it. They always get my order right and it is delivered in a timely manner. Overall I would strongly suggest this restaurant.
Chanel P.}Uptown, Chicago, IL}4}6}0}-1}1}4/24/2018}Delivery order so no opinion on restaurant itself. But the food is nasty. Ordered ramen that was supposed to have chicken in it.... no chicken. Doubt it would've helped at all because the taste was so bland regardless. When i asked for a refund - i got $4 back on a $17 bowl of ramen -_- Spare yourself and go somewhere with a decent chef who can read!
Lidia D.}New York, NY}26}53}112}-1}4}4/18/2018}What a hidden gem! I felt as if I was in Japan eating homemade ramen. The best part was trying Calais! A milk based drink both sweet and sour (weird) but, so good. I would defiantly come back and recommend the lunch special which is available 7 days a week!
Amy A.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}3/12/2018}We love this Tokyo style traditional ramen spot. Tan Tan Men is a must! It was so silky and delicious, and the karage portion was generous and super yummy. We ate in, and had great service. It was a steal at happy hour prices. My 10 year old son was choosing his next meal before we even got the check, and asking when we could come back. We will be back soon.
Candace C.}Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY}6}52}9}-1}4}3/12/2018}Really good ramen for the price. Place on 125th is about $3-4 more. Very much enjoyed. One complaint would be it was a little oily. May have been the "hot sauce" that was added though. Plan to order from again and ask for hot sauce on side. Very hot!!
Judith D.}Manhattan, NY}41}7}5}-1}5}3/9/2018Updatedreview}Now that I have figured out how to make my request very clear I have experienced nothing but the best tantanmen ramen I ever had.
Luz E.}Manhattan, New York, NY}1}6}24}-1}3}3/7/2018}I decided to visit this place after craving ramen for a few days. I only had a few minutes to eat. The place was packed and there was only one server which was an inconvenient . I had to wait for almost 30 minutes for my appetizer. I ordered the lunch combo. I order the Shayu Ramen and dumplings. I did not like the shoyu ramen, but I did enjoy the Gyoza dumplings.
Grace S.}Zürich, Switzerland}303}437}1804}-1}5}1/20/2018}Whether eating in or ordering delivery, this place is consistently reliable and tasty (and you may been to the original in the village).  Harlem and Morningside Heights still has a ways to go to offer the variety of Asian cuisine that downtown neighborhoods have but having RRK and Curry-Ya next door is a great start. The ramens and gyoza are consistently good even when delivered and delivery has been speedy each time I've used it on weekdays or weekend evenings.  They offer a frequent buyer's card too for those who want to keep coming back but I think dining in only qualifies for a stamp.
Sheila L.}New York, NY}0}11}0}-1}4}12/1/2017}The lunchtime combo is a great deal: $14.50 (as of Dec 2017) for an appetizer, ramen, drink, and mochi ice cream for dessert. I got Karaage (3 pieces of perfectly fried chicken!), Tan Tan Men (creamy, ginger-y soup with chilli oil, minced chicken, bean sprouts, bak choi, and a half boiled egg), a can of Oolong tea, and the Black Sesame ice cream. In perusing the menu and the choices of other customers, I think the Tan Tan Men was a good call as it seemed more flavorful and hearty than the shoyu and miso ramen. I did find it a tad spicy from the chilli oil, but then again, I can barely take any heat in spice.From the other reviews it seems that people have had less positive experiences with delivery, but I certainly enjoyed my in person visit. It's a small space, but well lit, clean, and festively decorated for the holiday season. Service is on the slow side, but I was on my day off and appreciate being able to savour my meal, for once!
Hannah C.}New York, NY}41}167}85}18}3}11/11/2017}I've been wanting to try this place for a while, today I placed an order for pickup and gave the mabo ramen a try. The noodles had a perfect texture, but the broth was strangely thick. This is literally the only time I've ever had ramen and not slurped up the broth. I guess with a mapo tofu inspired ramen the broth being thick makes some sense but it definitely wasn't for me. The taste was reminiscent of mapo tofu and the minced pork was good, but the texture of the tofu was firmer than I was hoping for. I would definitely try Rai Rai Ken again and try something a little more traditional.
June L.}Manhattan, NY}2}37}58}18}3}11/5/2017}There were no customers when I came, so in a way it was quick with service and peaceful in atmosphere, but an empty restaurant usually isn't a good sign. I got the Shoyu ramen. The broth was too light in flavor, but the toppings were nice. The pork was hard and impossible to chew. It's a spot for a quick fix but not one for an insanely good bowl of ramen.
Lillian S.}Fresh Meadows, NY}0}8}72}-1}4}9/30/2017}Use Groupon for $25 value. Pretty good deal and the ramen is good. Wish I can buy more Groupon for this store. Mochi is good too. We tried the miso ramen and shoyu ramen. Buy 10 ramen and get 1 free with the card.
Ed S.}Queens, Queens, NY}0}4}4}-1}5}8/29/2017}They serve really good ramen. Quiet with some great jazz music. Good customer service
Camila V.}Woodside, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}8/19/2017}Great experience and I enjoyed the Food. I had the shoyu and the veggie dumpling. The atmosphere is very calm and laid back. Would come again.
El B.}New York, NY}0}22}0}-1}1}8/11/2017}Maybe I missed a downhill warning but my ramen from here was yucky. Had carry out once delivery once, both times broth rank, veggies slimy, noodles mushy, meat a bit off. Never again.
Steph C.}Berkeley, CA}141}41}25}-1}5}7/11/2017}This place is great! I live in the neighborhood and this place has always been on my to do list. today I finally got around to trying ramen here. I had the lunch special. $14 for a huge bowl of shio ramen, a plate of gyoza, and a drink. It's an amazing deal- the type that can only be found in central Harlem. The food was delicious. I really liked the broth. It was rich without bring overpowering, and the noodles had a nice texture. I also got a green tea latte which was great!Service was quick and the waitress was really nice. I'll definitely be back!
Sandra A.}México, D.F., Mexico}135}11}24}-1}1}7/9/2017}Trust me on this one. The worst ramen I have ever had :( The noodles taste like instant ramen, the quality of the pork is terrible and the broth is way too greasy.
Sandro S.}Manhattan, NY}2}23}0}-1}3}6/26/2017}It has enough reasons to be graded lower than its branch in st marks. The veg dumplings I ordered were poorly cooked, and hard to be trusted as so-called homemade ones. Noodles are good though.
Maria S.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}53}33}2}-1}1}5/1/2017}If you read some of the reviews below I've had the same experience. I live in a 5 flight walk up and the delivery guy won't come up, he chain calls you. I've actually put specifically in my Grubhub instructions "I will not come down for food". He YELLED to come down and I said no I cannot. He screamed and cursed, he eventually came up, this is the second time this has happened. This delivery guy is lazy, and had a horrible attitude. I'm paying a minimum and a tip amount. Have more delivery people, figure something else out because I've never had an issue with this from any other restaurant, I can let it go once but this is consistent terrible service and I will never order from here again.
Rahman N.}Queens, NY}7}27}225}-1}4}4/29/2017}First of all, I wasn't expecting a huge bowl of ramen. Their price is reasonable for the amount food that you get. Tan tan men and mobu Ramen are very delicious. The store is very small and I think more than 10 people would make it crowded. They should have opened the stores as one instead of dividing it into two cause that I have given more space. The atmosphere is great and employees are nice. Ramen is okay .
Abby E.}New York, NY}96}2}0}-1}1}4/24/2017}I've been ordering from RaiRaiKen since they opened, as the food is tasty, but I'm done with them because they got rid of their lunch specials and their delivery service is terrible. They are just a couple blocks down from CCNY so you'd think they could figure out how to deliver to an office, but the delivery guy drives up in a car, for some reason (you're going to waste gas to drive some noodles 5 blocks?) and then calls you to come down, wander around and find him. He acts like he's never heard of the idea of entering a building to deliver food, and when you ask him what he looks like he just repeats where he is again and again. When the place had first opened, I was willing to be patient with this, and to just order pick up instead of delivery, but it's been years and I don't always have time to come down and get my food - I want it DELIVERED.
Deborah K.}Irving, TX}51}1}0}-1}1}4/9/2017}I went to this restaurant as it is next to the curry restaurant and they have the same owner. The man at the curry restaurant told me that since I don't eat curry, that I could order from this ramen place and bring it over so that I could eat together with my friends. The female employee at this ramen restaurant would NOT allow for me to eat with my friends. She yelled at me telling me I had to eat alone at their ramen restaurant or I'd have to pay more than advertised to have my food taken out to eat next door. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. No one can force me to eat alone at their restaurant when I came out to eat with my friends. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone unless she is gone or the service is made better. Her rudeness was unacceptable and uncalled for. Even the employees at the curry restaurant have acknowledged that and have said that her behavior is unacceptable and wrong.
Gilbert G.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}1}3/13/2017}Do I have to give one star? Can I give a 0? We ordered food through Grub Hub for delivery to our apartment, which is on the fourth floor. We, and many in our building, order delivery often and never have problems having the delivery guy bring the food to our door. We have a buzzer to buzz them up. Tonight we had a problem. The delivery guy called us telling us we had to come down stairs. We reminded him of the apt # and let him know we can buzz him up. He then said he couldn't find parking. All deliver guys park their bikes against a railing in the huge area in front of our building. There is plenty of space and no problem parking.  To make it worse, the delivery guy had been yelling at us the entire time. We then called the restaurant to see why he wouldn't deliver to our apt. She told us that we live in the projects so he isn't allowed to go in the building. HA! The projects, our building is an apartment building and not the projects. We then called Grubhub to complain. They called the restaurant and the new story was that they are saying the police are telling them they aren't allowed to go in our building. Yet, there has never been a problem from other restaurants. This sucks that we now have to re-order our food.
brian v.}Manhattan, NY}0}14}0}-1}4}12/23/2016}I'm thinking from reading these reviews there must be a great chef and a training chef.  The food I got blew me away with flavor.  But I was sitting at the very interesting wooden bar.  If the full interior was as nice as this bar with lovingly finished knotholes and all I'd give it a fifth star.   Sorry for those who got poor food or slow delivery - but if you hit it right, nothing is better.
Tracy F.}Harlem, Manhattan, NY}348}9}15}-1}1}12/19/2016}I ordered food online to have it delivered. NEVER again! It took over TWO HOURS. What kind of service is that? It's terrible!! The food wasn't even all that great! The ramen was luke warm! I am very upset
Paula D.}New York, NY}111}19}8}-1}5}12/11/2016}I'm a little bias because this place is literally 300 ft away from where I live. Here's a little story, when this place first opened I was the second customer here and in all honesty, I was super disappointed and I didn't go back for almost a year. Then one day, I was in dire need for ramen but also didn't want to go very far. I gave this place another chance and it was so amazing! Turns out, the owner changed from when they first opened. My boyfriend and I are regulars here now. Our usual is the cha-Han pork and tan tan men ramen with bamboo shoots and corn. They have a stamp card program and if you come 10 times, you get a free bowl of ramen!!!
Lisa H.}New York, NY}2}7}0}-1}1}12/10/2016}It took 2 hours to receive my food.  I ordered at 6:05.  An email indicated I would receive it by 7:15.  I called 3 times.  It just arrived at 8:15.  Don't waste your time.
Dimitri S.}New York, NY}59}221}320}-1}4}12/6/2016}A great addition to the neighborhood. If in the mood for delicious ramen (curry or miso recommended) gyoza (I had the veggie) and quiet place (off hours) to enjoy your meal in peace, this is a great place. Lots of their business is delivery, but the dining room is nice with four window stools, five stools at the counter and 5 two tops. Relaxingmusic is always playing in the background and the service is polite and welcoming.
Dee J.}Manhattan, NY}4}65}1}-1}2}10/31/2016}Ramen came 40 minutes with cold broth and had no flavor.Won't order from them EVER AGAIN.I agree with Samson D. pork was like cardboard and the vegetables were stall.WORSE RAMEN EVER!!!!
Samson D.}Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}1}10/12/2016}While it was a delivery i could be forgiving but this has to be the WORST RAMEN I have ever had. I have eaten in many Ramen joints and this was absolutely disgusting. The vegetables are stale and flavorless. The pork was as hard as cardboard with absolutely no taste. The whole dis was just disgusting.My review would not be as harsh had it not been for the owners attitude when I called to complain. It was excuse after excuse and he actually claimed to make the best Ramen in NYC. That I could nit expect a delivery to taste as good as in house. Well if thats the case, keep your product consistent and stop delivery service.I threw 90% of the food away. Didn't even feed it to my dog.
Nitai V.}Brooklyn, NY}187}5}0}-1}1}9/29/2016}Just ordered from here for the first time. Delivery didn't show up so I called and the lady on the phone says, oh it'll be there any minute. Another half an hour goes by, still nothing. About 45 minutes (around 1:45 after I ordered) the delivery guy calls me and asks me to go find him on the street since he "couldn't find parking". After a back and forth of about 4-5 minutes he finally leaves it in the lobby and leaves. I call the lady at the restaurant and she says, oh i'll call him and talk to him. She just called me back and said, oh did you get your food? No? Ok well he said he left it in the lobby and now he's going to come back to get it since you cancelled your order. Don't order from here, or at least hope that you don't get the useless delivery guy I just got.
Christy S.}Manhattan, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}8/9/2016}Great local ramen place right around the corner. I usually come here when I need a quick warm meal and don't want to go out too far. For the price it's a decent serving, clean inside seating, friendly staff. I can't go wrong with the karage and shoyu ramen. Pickup timing is not bad either usually 10-15 minutes when I order. Haven't needed to get delivery yet since it's so near by.
Atlanta N.}New York, NY}60}14}10}-1}2}7/30/2016}So for pros, the order came quickly and politely delivered to me. It arrived before the estimated arrival time. Cons: well, don't get me wrong, The pork belly buns were DELICIOUS...but the meat was kinda skimpy and if I'm going to shell out $8 for just two of these tiny things I'd expect bigger meat portions. I ordered the miso chicken ramen and the broth was flavorless!! Found myself adding sesame oil and soy sauce and ginger because literally it was so watery. They were efficient on delivery, but the quality of ramen is not so great if you're a true ramen lover.
Shirley C.}JAMAICA, NY}1}17}2}-1}4}5/1/2016}Surprisingly found their ramen to be pretty good. It's hard to find a good ramen restaurant. Only reason why I'd give four stars is because the delivery guy was so rude over the phone and yelling at me. I had the tantalum thingy one that was good. Their gyozas not too much because they add water chestnuts in them and I absolutely hate them.
Sam P.}New York, NY}39}1}0}-1}2}4/29/2016}This is mediocre ramen. The service is bad. I recommend avoiding.
Jay I.}Union City, NJ}7}12}7}-1}1}4/24/2016}One word - absolutely terrible. The food was supposed to be delivered within 45-60 minutes but I did not receive my food after waiting for 70 minutes, so I followed up with them through Eat24. An agent told me that the driver left the restaurant 5 minutes ago. I waited another 20 minutes (at this point it had been more than 90 minutes). I followed up again and the agent told me that the food was delivered and a guy came down to pick it up. I cannot believe the restaurant would lie to customers like this. We have a doorman and he did not see anyone coming by dropping the food. After waited for nearly two hours, the restaurant said, they would re-deliver the food but the kitchen is already closed, so I would get the food tomorrow if I'd like. I am utterly disappointed with their attitude and service. Looking at other people's review, my experience with RRK really confirms why they are a three-star Yelp restaurant.
K A.}Manhattan, NY}1}20}21}-1}4}4/23/2016}Loved the tan tan ramen.  Soup is mid spicy and creamy.  Good amount toppings... It is much better than the Jin ramen!  I will order again!
MinhDuyen N.}New York, NY}111}142}746}18}4}4/1/2016Updatedreview}updateso the food came.... finallypretty damn good. the soup was delicious and creamy. would come again !
Breanna W.}Brooklyn, NY}105}2}0}-1}4}3/13/2016}The service was great, I came in with a group of 9 and they happily seated up even though it was unexpected. I had the lunch special with a pork bun and mabo ramen. The pork bun was great, but the mabo ramen wasn't for me. I would go here again.
Janice F.}Manhattan, NY}574}503}401}-1}3}3/6/2016}I read the reviews on Rai Rai Ken and a lot of them were about how delivery is slow.  So I thought, hey - maybe if I actually go there it won't be so bad.  But, I was wrong - sitting there is just as slow as delivery.This makes sense though - there's only one delivery guy (who waits until a bunch of orders have come in before delivering), one guy working the counter and packing all the delivery things and taking care of in-store customers, and one chef.  I'm assuming they can't handle the same influx of orders that other ramen places can, especially it being so close to City College.  Either way, we probably sat inside for about 1 1/2 hours, spending only 30 minutes eating.  There is a lunch special - app, ramen, and drink.  It was okay, not the best but the broth was flavorful for the vegetarian ramen.  It was also fully loaded with veggies - brussel sprouts, broccoli, corn, fried garlic, etc.  We both asked for a soft-boiled egg and they actually put the whole egg in my friend's bowl so I'm guessing he forgot to cut it and put it in mine.  Anyway, I don't think I'll be back, the service is just too slow but the prices are pretty good for about $8 a bowl.
C. R.}New York, NY}0}22}1}-1}1}3/3/2016}Awful. Simply awful. Delivery was more than 20 minutes late and the veggie ramen was bland and boring. It was basically overcooked ramen with microwave steamed Birdseye veggies on top. The edamame didn't look fresh... Just all around bad. Did I mention it cost $10.50? Don't bother.
Eric L.}New York, NY}12}6}2}-1}3}1/20/2016}I used to dine a lot at the one in East Village. Compare to this new branch, the soup of soy ramen is kinda too lite. I was expecting a little bit more thick flavor. Overall of my ramen is just ok. The fried chicken is still pretty good. Hope they will improve their soup stock.
Shayla G.}New York, NY}360}150}5}-1}1}1/16/2016}Ordered delivery online today, it came promptly. I got the shoyu ramen with extra thin straight noodles and the pork dumplings. the dumplings were fine, not great but they were pretty good. The ramen was absolutely flavorless. I had to add soy sauce and spicy sauce and there was still no flavor. The noodles weren't the correct noodles , I was given the wavy ones instead, the pork was dry and looked like it'd been sitting at the bottom of a tray for hours, the toppings were cold, and the bamboo shoots were mushy. Needless to say it was not worth the 20 dollars. I will likely not be ordering from this place again.
Dora A.}Manhattan, NY}3}20}12}-1}4}1/14/2016}Pretty good ramen spot in the neighborhood. Had the vegetarian miso ramen with spicy sauce on the side. I ordered carry out and everything was neatly package. The girl who took my order was really sweet and welcoming. Very filling and just what I needed on this cold evening. Couldn't give it 5 stars bc I've had better BUT still pretty good.
Fede Z.}Manhattan, NY}102}3}0}-1}1}12/6/2015}We ordered delivery. A soup container was broken and started leaking when I got to the kitchen. On top of that both the ramen noodles and the soup were cold. The order was awfully presented and I will never order from them again.
Laurel P.}New York, NY}14}3}0}-1}1}11/29/2015}Inedible sour/off.   Awful customer service response.This was the worst food ordering experience that I've ever had. We ordered two bowls of ramen, pork buns, and also some potstickers.  When we received the food, everything was incredibly cold and tasted spoiled.   I was completely grossed out! I decided to try the pork buns which are usually a favorite of mine but I couldn't even bite through the pork because it was so tough, not to mention flavorless.  The chicken in the miso was sour, the soft boiled egg was brown rubber, and the broth was salty and stale.  Overall, the quality of the food was inedible and we were completely disappointed.  We decided to call the restaurant after only taking a few bites to try to get our money back because we didn't want to waste $45 on food we weren't able to eat. The owner told us he would come by to inspect and pick up the food which I thought was weird.  He arrived after ten minutes and proceeded to open the food and argue with us about the quality and try to get us to have them make it again despite my repeated refusal to try their food again during this transaction.  There was no way I was going to put any food they made into my body out of fear of food poisoning.  He was creepy and rude throughout and ended by saying he would go back to the restaurant and decide what to do later.  Here's the kicker... he TOOK our food with him! Not that we could have eaten it, but that's basically just stealing and taking our money as well as the merchandise and leaving us with nothing. We tried to give him a chance to make it better and told him that we didn't want to finish with a bad experience and then he argued with us, took our food, and walked off without giving us a response. That's all I have to say about that, oh, and don't give them your money unless you want cold spoiled food and food poisoning.
Sierra L.}Baltimore, MD}0}13}0}-1}4}11/12/2015}Love ordering from this place, especially online. Depending on the day, my order is ready in 15-20 minutes! Yummy food, (love the shoyu ramen) also love the lunch special! Limited seating, great for carry out. Swing by if your in the area.
Andy K.}North Strathfield, Australia}16}34}13}-1}3}11/10/2015}Tonight was the 2nd time ordering delivery from RRK. Honestly if my dinner did not take 1 1/2 hours to get to me this would have been a 4 star rating possibly even 5. I ordered Shoyu Ramen with extra sprouts and extra bamboo. It was flavorful and fresh and it came nice and hot. A second delivery guy may be needed to cater to a growing delivery customer base.
Admir M.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}11/1/2015}The worse delivery service ever. It took them 2.5 hours to deliver the food after calling the restaurant several times, and this restaurant had the audacity of delivering cold food that tasted like crap. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place if you can because you will regret ordering from here guarantee.
Sara P.}New York, NY}123}32}8}-1}1}11/1/2015}I placed an order at 5:54pm. Delivery estimate was 30-45 minutes. I called after the first hour to ask for the status of my order, and was told that the order was still in the kitchen. I called after an hour and 40 minutes and was told by a lady that she would call her boss and call me back. I received my order at 7:50! I waited nearly 2 hours for my order. I tried calling the restaurant several times again to ask if this is typical, and now I keep getting a busy tone. Very frustrating, and very disappointing. I should have walked over to Hand Pulled Noodle and had NO WAIT and fresh hot food versus this! Terrible!!!!!
P S.}Manhattan, NY}0}41}0}-1}5}10/19/2015}Yum, yum, yum.   I was starving and cold and dying for a hearty, flavorful, delicious meal.  This did the trick and then some.  I had the Miso Ramen.  Deeply flavorful and hearty, and absolutely delicious.  The portion sizes are hefty, too.  I definitely overate and still have enough left for dinner tonight.  I have a feeling this place will be my go-to, especially this winter.  This is a welcome addition to the delivery options uptown, which can be grim.  Highly recommend!
Yeari C.}New York, NY}1}41}1}-1}4}10/17/2015}We ordered from this place for the first time today and got the Vegetarian Miso Ramen with spicy sauce and the Mabo-don. Despite the order arriving to our apartment about 15 minutes late, the two dishes were very delicious. The portions of the food are large comparative to the cheap prices, so you're definitely getting more for your buck.
Marie B.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}9/26/2015}Tastes great. Cheap noodles but perfect price for the neighborhood. Fried garlic is a nice touch.
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}0}16}0}-1}3}8/31/2015}I always got the lunch combo because the price is pretty good. Miso Ramen somehow tasted weird to me, Shoyu Ramen is better. My favorite here is the Karaage (Fried Chicken), always juicy and delicious. Pork bun is just ok, I personally don't like the mayo in it. Gyoza is also just ok, nothing special. As an Asian living in the neighborhood, I am glad that there's something other than fake Chinese food take-outs, so, still gonna come back when I want Ramen.
Megan L.}Boston, MA}59}33}4}-1}3}8/30/2015}Passed by this place, but perhaps it's closed on Mondays? Ordered a little later!Boyfriend and I got: shoyu ramen, miso ramen, gyoza and steamed shrimp dumplingsskip the shrimp dumplings - these are like the frozen ones with an extra shrimp on top. the shoyu ramen was also a bit flavorless, nothing special :(the gyoza were good though!miso ramen was definitely the star - i got it with thick noodles, which i recommend. and added an egg! way better than Jin Ramen, in my opinion. cheaper and yummier. hope Rai Rai Ken becomes the new star of ramen uptown!
J. Marty D.}Manhattan, NY}6}7}2}-1}4}7/30/2015}While small and primarily geared towards take-out, Rai Rai Ken has delicious food, a very pleasant staff, a loyalty/rewards card, fast delivery, reasonable prices... just a nice noodle shop. The meat quality is significantly better than its trendier cousin, Jin Ramen, which is more style than substance. ENJOY!

Sean K.}Flemington, NJ}53}7}0}-1}1}7/15/2015}My fiancee and I were eager to try Rai Rai Ken when it opened on Amsterdam in Harlem based on its uniformly complimentary reviews.   We could not have been more disappointed. After taking the upselling suggestion that I add a soft boiled egg to the Shoyu Ramen for an extra dollar, I took our 30 dollar order home to discover both ramens were grossly lacking in everything but noodles and broth - zero seafood in the Shoyu Ramen . . . and no soft boiled egg.  So, if you're looking for an exceptional Asian noodle experience, try Hand Pulled Noodle on Broadway, you can skip Rai Rai Ken, you're not missing anything.
Liezel T.}Manhattan, NY}1}12}3}-1}4}7/8/2015}Was very surprised and happy to receive my delivery order today..everything tastes great and was packaged neatly with the broth being in a separate container from the noodles. The lunch special included one pork bun, the curry ramen and a can of green tea for $10.50..all was fab and had a more than decent flavor in my opinon...! The only downside is that I ordered at lunchtime and even though seamless said only 45 minutes it took about 1.5 hr. All is well, because it was worth it and I will order again soon.
Will M.}New York, NY}0}24}1}-1}4}6/25/2015}I had the curry ramen and gyoza and really enjoyed both.   Reasonable prices with a great lunch special - $10 for appetizer/entrée/beverage if I recall correctly.   It is mostly a take-out/delivery place but one can eat there if looking for a quick casual place to eat.  I actually wish it was located several blocks to the north up by all the other new places opening farther up by City College in the 130s/140s since its location is not on the best part of Amsterdam Avenue.
Edjanine S.}Manhattan, NY}2}99}36}-1}1}6/21/2015}This review is for the things i had for delivery.So my husband and i found this place as we were in bus m11 passing through amsterdamSo the delivery time was decent, it came less than 30 mins.So we got:Miso ramen- not really a big fan didnt like the flavor, id give it a 1/5, didnt even finish the whole bowl, i had add on of fried tofu for $1?!!! Those were only 4 small pcs for $1?!!! Come on.... 4 thin slice fish cake fir $1?!!! Spicy on the side $1?!!!! Thats sooooooooo upsetting karaage- 2/5 the batter is too thick chicken fried rice -2/5 wayyyy too blantAnyway... im the type of yelper where i give places a 2nd chance... but il pass for rai rai ken.. its too expensive and the flavor is not all that
Jonathan C.}Fremont, CA}0}42}2}-1}3}6/12/2015}The ramen is okay, but the Mapo Don is way too salty. I know it goes with rice but this one is a little too much. Lower the sodium level!
Scott J.}Salt Lake City, UT}143}348}3}-1}5}6/10/2015}My new favorite Ramen place in North Manhattan.  I've had the curry ramen, miso ramen, and gyoza (fried dumplings).  All were excellent.  Fast delivery, and nice staff inside the restaurant.  The space is small, and has very few chairs.  It is mainly a takeout destination.
Steven K.}New York, NY}229}118}42}-1}4}5/10/2015}Before you go all gaga on RaiRaiKen Uptown, you must know that this is primarily a CARRY OUT and Delivery operation.  I was a bit disappointed when I arrived with hopes of sitting at a table and enjoying my tasty Ramen UPTOWN.  I don't think Ramen was meant to be served in a plastic bowl with a plastic spoon.  But once the ramen arrived and entered my mouth, I was pleased.  It could have been served in a tortoise shell or dixie cup.  It was DELICIOUS!  There are counters (2) with fixed-position stools that you sit at - either facing Amsterdam Ave and the projects or the wall.  The entire time I was there nobody came in to eat, but delivery orders were going out so I guess the word is out - this place delivers great food, but not the best atmosphere for dining in.  Having visited the downtown location for years, I couldn't help but feel a little 'dissed.  Uptown deserves some tables, please???  The liquor license isn't activated yet, so perhaps once they get it they can expand and add some tables.  One of the reasons I eat out is for a bit of atmosphere, camaraderie etc...  This is totally lacking here.  But the Ramen SAVES the day.  YUM.  I had the vegetarian ramen.  Rich miso broth and very tasty fresh veggies like corn, snow pea pods, cauliflower, carrots, scallions and broccoli along with fried garlic slices all made me smile.  I hope they add the cold summer noodle salad to the menu soon.  I've had it downtown and it's one of my favorite May-October dishes in NYC.
Maria D.}New York, NY}4}14}81}-1}5}5/3/2015}The service was good and the food was great.  I had a bowl of Shoyu ramen with the addition of an egg and spinach. I worry that ramen will be too salty for me but this was just right. I also tried the pan fried pork gyoza and the pork buns. Everything was delicious! There was a little slowness in our service so to make up for it they gave us Mochi ice cream. That was yummy too!
Jonathan L.}Manhattan, NY}53}10}1}-1}5}4/20/2015}This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Food was great, best dumplings I've had in a long time, and the ramen is delicious.Great lunch special as well.
L S.}Manhattan, NY}35}24}6}-1}5}3/28/2015}This outpost of the East Village Rai Rai Ken recently opened and I could not be more thrilled, because I live across the street :) A small, lunch-counter style ramen place with a simple menu of 5 ramens and three rice dishes, plus an assortment of apps and a $10.50 lunch combo special. I went there for lunch two days in a row and really enjoyed the Mabo-don (stir-fried ground pork and tofu in a spicy sauce over rice) and curry ramen. My lunch companions on each day had the miso ramen and both enjoyed it very much. The pork buns were tasty but could perhaps use a more even covering of sauce (according to my companion).  The gyoza was also very good and I would get it as an app again for sure.The owner (I presume) seems like a really great guy and mentioned he has plans to open a curry ramen place next door! Excited to have them in the neighborhood.

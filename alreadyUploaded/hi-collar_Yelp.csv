Chen D.}New York, NY}0}29}0}-1}3}5/4/2018}This place is very small so go early. Food wise the omurice is not bad, but I don't think it is worth the price or hype. I got the omurice with the sauce and that cost $14 alone, you have pay extra if you want to add the pork cutlet. The rice has this particular sake or rice wine taste it's pretty good but other than that it just nice egg with rice. I was disappointed in the pancake, not worth it order the dessert the dessert instead.
tiffany c.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}1}43}2}-1}3}5/3/2018}This is a small cafe with only bar style seating. When we arrived, there was a line of about ten people but it moved SO SLOWLY because there were only about 10 seats inside! We waited about 2 hours. We got the omurice with Demi glacé sauce, Katsu sandwich, and the hot cakes. The hot cakes and the Katsu sandwich were really good but the omurice was lacking any flavor... which is weird because omurice should just be seasoned fried rice drowned in Demi glacé sauce. I didn't even enjoy the egg- it was way too bland. I also didn't enjoy the coffee, which left a weird taste.
Teresa C.}Queens, NY}167}178}412}18}4}5/2/2018}I came on a Sunday for lunch and did NOT expect a huge line out the door. We were contemplating going somewhere else, but had our hearts set on omurice with that soft, fluffy, exploding egg, so we decided to wait. Good thing the weather was nice and we figured if there's a line, it has to be decent. We waited about 30-40 mins. I was surprised how tiny it is inside. There's one long, narrow bar like counter with maybe 8-10 stools, which explains the lines. The decor is very cute and hipster-y without being pretentious. The waitress and staff were Japanese and took orders quickly, but didn't rush making the food or drinks and created a very laid back, cafe like atmosphere. The care and precision they put into their drinks are evident in the taste and presentation, but it still hurts me to pay anything more than $5 for a small tea or coffee. We ordered the omurice with Demi glacé, fish roe cream pasta, and the fluffy hot cakes. The omurice was very insta worthy. Slice it down the middle so it splits perfectly around the rice. Everything had subtle and delicate flavors very reminiscent of Japanese cuisine. I really liked everything we ordered, but just wish the portions were bigger for what you're paying. Other than that, I'm glad I tried this place out, but probably wouldn't wait 30 mins again.
Charlie Z.}Western Water Catchment, Singapore, Singapore}118}6}11}-1}5}4/30/2018}A tiny shop surrounded by other 4 Japanese restaurants still has its own allure to draw a long line of patrons. The restaurant is of an elongated small bar setting with a very long bar table. You sit on the high stools facing 3 Japanese ladies who serve you and also prepare the food. Tonkastu sandwich is hot and tender. The pork chop is fried just to the right timing, crispy on the outside and juicy and flavorful on the inside. The little cup of pickles that comes along is refreshing. The slight sour and sweet tinge, coupled with the crunchiness, perfectly complements the filling pork.  The egg rice is another delight. The gravy on top covers the tender egg and flows into the fragrant rice. The moment you put one spoonful into your mouth, the rich combination of egg, gravy and rice fills it up. As you chew, the flavour becomes even fuller and more satisfying. Food: 9/10Service:4/5Price: ~ $20
Victoria T.}Chicago, IL}183}54}74}18}5}4/25/2018}The first time I walked past here on a whim in search for some Japanese dessert, at night they're a cocktail bar. The bartender there was friendly and explained how their lunch and dinner menu are different. I came back a few days later with my friend. We had the katsu sandwich and the omurice, then the matcha rice cripsy to finish! Definitely a new neighborhood favorite. Everything was delightful! I'm not a coffee drinker anymore but I had a sip of what my friend had and it was amazing. Wonderful spot with a welcoming team. **if you're coming here for lunch with more than two people, prepare to wait! Seating is limited but cosy.
Misscritical N.}Manhattan, NY}0}24}4}-1}5}4/23/2018}I never wait online unless my table is not quite ready at a place. Why do so when the city has endless amazing options and you're starving?! But my sister loves this lace and I wasn't in a hurry. Luckily it was a warm sunny Sunday 4.22.18. This 12 seat spot is so narrow you practically brush the other diners as you get to your stools- but other than that, it was amazing across the board. The hot cakes were so fluffy and cakey; good alone, or with the whipped cream, syrup or butter. The iced coffee- Many options- was strong and did the trick. The ambiance and decor was on point, right down to the vintage Japanese matchbooks that lined the top shelf. The kitschy rooster creamer, the copper coffee mug, the Japanese toilet and the 1920s Jazz- no touch was overlooked. Definitely an enjoyable brunch experience worth experiencing.
Diana C.}San Francisco, CA}272}181}426}18}5}4/21/2018}This place is so cute. I haven't been to Japan yet but I feel like I've already been transported there the moment I stepped inside Hi-Collar. There is only bar seating for about 12 people so expect a realllly long line. I waited about 1.5 hours for this as my first NY meal with my friend and as I got hangry in line, my friend kept reminding me that it will be worth it. So I held out for it instead of dashing to the next door curry shop. Once we finally made it in, we got the omurice with demi-glaze sauce and add on sausage, the hot cakes with strawberries, and the chicken katsu sandwich. We went for the sandwich because it said they only serve 12 a day. CHICKEN KATSU SANDWICHThe sandwich was good but didn't really blow my mind as something super unique.HOT CAKESThe hot cakes weren't jiggly like my friend expected so I think we weren't as impressed but it was yummy regardless. Takes 15 minutes for them to make.OMURICE WITH DEMI GLAZE SAUCEBut enough about all those things because the omurice was the highlight of the meal. It didn't neatly break apart when we tried to slice through it since we had the sausage in the middle but wow that sauce was amazing. Maybe I even got slightly drunk off it since the sauce tasted like wine. It was sweet and salty and made every second of being hangry worth it. The omurice was so good that I even claimed it as my #1 favorite meal of my entire 5 day NY trip.
Simo L.}Olney, MD}0}6}0}-1}5}4/14/2018}Amazing staff. They were very friendly. I love the way how they concentrate only one type of dish and make it extremely elegant and tasty. And the environment or how the place is constructed is absolutely another plus. Very warm and welcome. Last thing is the coffee they have. Can't ask for more
Monica K.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}10}-1}5}4/9/2018}It's a long wait but foods were really good! Was worth waiting! Fluffy pancakes were so soft and yummy, pastas were great too but the overall portion was bit small.
Patricia J.}New York, NY}167}70}33}-1}5}3/17/2018}This is the only place I know of in the city where you can get some delicious Japanese hotcakes. Since this is counter seating, if you plan on coming for breakfast or lunch try to arrive right at opening time during weekends. Does not get too crowded during the day during the week. I'm a fan of everything I've had here, Omurice, Katsu sandwich, and of course the hot cakes which is a must try if you're paying a visit. Their cold brew is the smoothest I've ever had. The ladies who work here are awesome and very welcoming. Check out the toilet, seat warmer is nice during the winter! (Lol)
Melody M.}Manhattan, New York, NY}299}23}21}-1}5}3/15/2018}Hidden gem of East Village - stumbled upon this cozy and adorable Japanese restaurant, cafe and sake bar. Limited seating (8-10 people) but the service was great, ambience inviting and the food absolutely fantastic. My friend got the katsu sandwich (not featured since we devoured it before pulling our phones out): pork katsu was clean and chewy, not super greasy and mildly seasoned with a not-spicy curry sauce. The complimentary pickled veggies were also delicious, crisp and not at all over the top salty. I ordered the original omurice, a classic Japanese comfort food, with tomato colored red rice, topped with lightly cooked scrambled eggs, and adorned with ketchup. You can wait quietly for your food while listening to banters among their friendly Japanese staff, or pour your heart out over a cup of coffee/ sake, depending on the mood. Reasonably priced and overall amazing experience! We are definitely coming back for more- aiming to try the fluffy, hot Japanese pancakes next time
Ari K.}Manhattan, New York, NY}93}5}0}-1}3}3/13/2018}o-okay, very long wait for the food, I guess the vibe wanted to be chill--but too chill that it became tiresome. It took approximately 38mins for an omurice, and there were only two in front of me. Decent, but not willing to go again.
Victor C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}7}1}-1}3}3/13/2018}Had the omurice - while it was fairly good, it lacked any special flavors. I think that the environment is what's so inviting about hi-collar, and the service is pretty good.
Albert K.}Manhattan, New York, NY}206}11}0}-1}4}3/13/2018}When I was strolling down the street on a nice weekday I found this place to be very aesthetically pleasing. I went in to discover the fluffiest omurice I have ever eaten. This was great but too little food for the price
Mark G.}Woodmere, NY}186}61}204}-1}5}3/7/2018}What a fantastic Sake bar!I've been to this place over a dozen time and they bar tenders never fail to impress me with their class, style, and fine-tuned recommendations to fit my palettes sake desires.-God-like bathroom experience
Mengjia Y.}Jersey City, NJ}34}83}384}-1}5}3/7/2018}There are only 13 seats and I arrived at 10.40am. So I don't need to wait for too long. Otherwise you need to wait for at least 45 minutes. The omurice, pancake and parfait is great. Many cereal banana and strawberry taste good in the parfait. I will never come again since it is tooooo crowded!!!!
Gina X.}New York, NY}146}12}7}-1}5}3/4/2018}This was a restaurant that my friend highly recommended. We went on a Saturday around 12:30PM, the wait was still an hour. To put things even more in perspective, it was snowing! Even then the wait was SO WORTH IT! The place itself is a very cozy vibe, bar style restaurant which explains why the wait is so long.There's an extensive list of teas and coffee, but less variety for brunch. I got the Omurice with Katsu and Demi-Glazed sauce. The omelet was fluffy and cooked to perfection, and the sauce was flavorful but not overkill. The portion was good, I didn't feel stuffed or gross after eating, which is definitely a win win. Overall, I would definitely recommend! If you've never tried Omurice before I think this is the place to try it.
Bonnie C.}New York, NY}162}131}54}18}5}3/4/2018}Long ass wait-an hour? on the weekend (we started waiting at 1PM). Was it worth it? Eeehh.I would say yes because I spent it with good company so make sure to come with a crew you're fond of!The coffee was spectacular-cold brew. Crisp, refreshing, bold, with a great aftertaste. I got the original omurice and split the hot cakes with two others. Obviously (although I forgot), taste the hot cakes right after it comes out! So you're truly eating hot cakes vs. lukewarm turned cold cakes. Haha. The citrus infused butter that it's served with truly takes the... cake. Ba dum bum tzzz. Lol Overall, good place that'll leave you feeling truly satiated. I'd come back for the coffee alone!
Ellen C.}Fort Lee, NJ}149}111}673}18}4}3/4/2018}Four stars based on the past two visits (5 and 3).First time was on a daytime for coffee/brunch. The second time was at Saturday night time for a sake cocktails. I personally liked their daytime visit more. The ambiance seems to be cozy for daytime, and it turns into a high end classy, elegant sake bar at night time. The interior decor is cute and makes you feel like you are in Japan. Both times we had to wait about 30 minutes or so (as they only have 12 bar seatings total). Turnover seems to be pretty fast. Their cold brew coffee and other coffee selections were very aromatic and flavorful. We enjoyed our time here.When we came at night and ordered yuzu sake and fruit sake. They were so tasty and delicious; I loved them both. My only complaints for the yuzu sake was.. the bartender didn't even pour half the glass (as attached in my picture, and that is a glass before I even took my first sip). Okay experience for my second visit. I would go back for their daytime brunch menu.
Stacy Y.}New York, NY}2}33}11}-1}5}3/2/2018}Really good service! I came here for sake at night and the bartender took the time to explain each one. I really want to come back during the day when it's a cafe so I can try the omurice
Beverly Z.}Arlington, VA}282}26}105}-1}4}2/26/2018}Hi-Collar is an unique Japanese cafe spot that is good for brunch/lunch in the East Village. Other Japanese cafes in New York are more like bakeries, while this one is a sit down. I've been twice during the day, but apparently at night, it turns into more of a bar scene. It is a very narrow space and there is only seating at the bar. There are very few seats, so even though my friend and I got there around 11:15am (15 minutes past opening), there was already a line. The wait was about 40 minutes because of that, which is understandable since it was prime brunch time. Once you get seated though, the service is quick since you're sitting at a bar.They have a nice variety of coffee prepared in different methods (pour over, aeropress, siphon, etc.). I decided to get the siphon since that is not usually offered in most places. It was pricier and most of the beans are an extra dollar or two, but the coffee was genuinely great! I don't usually drink coffee black unless it's good, and theirs was.For food, there aren't that many different options besides their omurice (an omelette on top of fried rice, usually with ketchup on top), a couple of sandwiches, and hotcakes. There aren't that many options, but their omurice and hot cakes are customizable. I chose to get the omurice with the cream sauce and katsu on top. It was pricy, but it was tasty and the omelette was fluffly. I tried my friend's hot cake, and it was not bad but the portion was kind of small.Overall, I think Hi-Collar is a good place to try out (maybe on a weekday for shorter waits). I would definitely come back for the coffee and if I am craving the omurice. The portions are small and it's a bit expensive, but nothing too exorbitant.
Diana P.}New York, NY}322}220}635}18}1}2/21/2018}This review is solely for the rude customer service we received from the bartender.  When we got seated, it took at least 10 minutes for him to attend to us and ask what we would like. Granted we were in rush since we were on a 1 hour wait for Raku so I tried to get his attention 5 minutes into us getting seated to put an order in. After getting his attention, he would put up his hand as if he was trying to say "wait please" but in a rude expression. He caught himself and said "I'm sorry" and I said that's fine. When he finally got our order, it took at least another 20 minutes for him to MAKE our drinks. Why? What was he doing? Busy chit chatting with the other customers especially young girls and making small talk about the latest sake bottles. And I don't mean to be racist, but we were surrounded by several Japanese speaking customers. He, without a doubt, showed favoritism towards them, spoke in Japanese and just kept chit chatting with them while while making us wait. It got up to the point that I was almost starting to get confused whether he was the bartender or just the guy that works at the cash register because he showed NO notion of trying to prepare our drinks. I didn't see him making any drinks for anyone else after we got there. When he finally started to make our drinks, he left midway AGAIN to talk to customers. Excuse me ?! Can you please finish making your drink and DOING YOUR JOB before you start socializing with other people again ?! How rude and disrespectful of other people's time. By the time he finished making our drinks, we had 5 minutes left to finish our drinks since our 1 hour wait at Raku was up. We literally has to chug our drinks in order to make it. It was not enjoyable at all and it showed that it took him almost a whole hour just to get our drinks. I also had to cancel the seared mackeral order that he claimed would only take 10-15 minutes to come out because we needed to leave by the time our drinks came out. That is unbelievable and ridiculous and the WORST customer service ever. Maybe since we aren't Japanese speaking, we got the low end of the service ? I have no idea, but it was very apparent and obvious the difference in treatment. It's sad that such an elegant and intimate setting that is tainted by such service and the drinks were mediocre. The one was with a mixture of beer and calpico was good compared to the mojito mix than the mojito.
Anna W.}Manhattan, NY}34}9}22}-1}4}2/8/2018}They do one of the best coffee in New York. Omurice with Demi glacé sauce was the right size, a little bit strong on the wine, but still very delicious! The mochi red bean was a sweet dessert with a unique hint of salt from the seaweed shaved.The place is small and only has bar seats, the line is usually long and they don't have a line system, which means you have to form a line in front of the shop. Very nice interior, sensitive to details and gives a vintage feeling.
Yuki H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}2/8/2018}Overrated. Terrible food. I ordered their original omurice and it tasted so CHEAP. The rice was not evenly mixed with ketchup, so there was bunch of white unmixed rice chunks. Don't waste your time in that long waiting line. We thought we were lucky when the people in front of us decided to go to eat somewhere else. But turns out, they were wise like yoda.
Amber L.}Portland, OR}49}1}0}-1}2}2/5/2018}After order the omelette I was waiting 50 mins for it. How could it possible that you guys cook eggs and rice can use 50 mins??? And the taste is not delicious
Carol B.}Ridgewood, Queens, NY}372}803}127}18}5}1/27/2018}Extremely cute tea and Japanese dessert bar. They also have some savory options. Large selection of teas, coffee, including matcha, Vietnamese iced coffee, and so much more. Their parfaits look delicious! If you're looking for a place to grab a drink (alcoholic or not) with a friend, definitely give this a shot.
Catherine C.}New York, NY}230}125}170}18}4}1/26/2018}Was extremely hyped to come check it out for brunch after stopping by for drinks one evening.Get here on time at 11 on the dot if you want a seat without wait on a weekend. We got here at 11:07 and waited for a friend to get seated; She got here at 11:15 and we scooped up the last 3 remaining seats, right after a couple came in and took 2 before us. There are 11 seats overall. So in general, think less the urgency than sneaker drops, more than the urgency of a full bladder. . .Food was somewhat disappointing in that it really is rather expensive for what you are getting. I got omurice, and it's literally rice slathered in ketchup, with omelette on top, and mushroom topping was extra. The hotcakes are pretty good, but fruit on top is also extra. It was okay, but not over the top good or filling. For that price, I would actually rather have a traditional ~western~ brunch of a veggie omelet with salad/fries. . .What you pay for is most likely the ambiance here. But the COFFEE. The coffee here is SO good, and the best I have ever had. It is also rather expensive, so I got the cheapest option, their house blend instead of some pure, single source thing, and it was still so so so good. (Move aside, blue bottle!) I will definitely come back to try the different coffees, and maybe splurge on the aeropress one that gets heated up in this cool looking thing!
Jeff L.}Rego Park, NY}1251}130}1625}-1}4}1/25/2018}Its always hard to get a spot here during lunch rush.  I've been wanting to try their omurice! Today we got to try Menti Pasta This was really simple but flavorful i'm a fan of this kind of pasta its light but filling and easy to eat for lunch or a quick bite.  Good sized portion and consistency demi glace omurice with katsu This is a favorite so its red wine reduction sauce, glazed over the fluffy egg and it was yummy, the katsu is nicely sized and breaded.  I just wanted to dip things back in the sauce the egg / rice.  cream omurice with KatsuThe cream sauce is a bit different but still very good, it has less of a tarty taste.  More rich and creamy kind of sauce with your omurice and egg!They also are a sakebar at night! Clean bathroom as well.  Just come early and be prepared to wait 20-30 mins, its not a very big place, bar seating at best 10 people? Next time I need come back for coffee! Check out the pictures and follow my IG Jliueats / LcrazyaznL
Alyssa Z.}Manhattan, New York, NY}83}1}0}-1}5}1/13/2018}Our bartender Koda was fantastic and friendly. Amazing setting. Amazing drinks. My party stumbled upon this place and we have absolutely no regrets about it.
Michelle Y.}New York, NY}401}5}7}-1}4}1/13/2018}Must get the Katsu Omurice!! It was so delicious that I devoured it within like 5 minutes or less (I was also very hungry). I also ordered the hot cakes (cute Japanese pancakes) and their iced coffee. They were both ok - not as mindblowing as the katsu omurice. Cute for the gram tho. There was a pretty long wait to get in as this restaurant only fits like 8-10 people at a time. My boyfriend and I came here for brunch at like 1PM on a Saturday. So I recommend coming a little earlier to avoid longer wait time.As for price, the katsu omurice came out to be $11 omurice + $6 for katsu and the hot cakes were $9.50. This might be a little pricey but "normal" brunch prices. Definitely would come here again for a fancy brunch date and try their different sauce omurice.
Sunhee L.}New York, NY}212}22}73}-1}5}1/12/2018}Japanese Chinese fusion style omelette was so good! It was my first time trying a new dish. Was unique and delish. The restaurant was kind of small but cozy and modern ambience. Heard they have amazing brunch as well. Cant wait to try it next time!
Sarah A.}New York, NY}1}10}4}-1}5}1/10/2018}Absolutely delicious omurice! I'm not a big coffee drinker but my friends tell me it's very good here.
Abena O.}Manhattan, NY}12}123}55}-1}4}1/2/2018}This is a very small restaurant with only counter seating. Whenever I eat here, I go alone or with one other person -- this restaurant isn't suited for groups. They don't take reservations, so I usually go right when it opens to avoid a long wait.I was initially drawn to Hi-Collar, because I wanted to try Omurice. I have had a couple of other things on their menu, but I think the Omurice is their star. You can get additional toppings on it such as katsu, sausage, etc. to make it more filling. My only complaint is that Hi-Collar is a little pricey, but you're guaranteed to leave satisfied.
Nancy L.}New York, NY}0}5}4}-1}4}12/31/2017}Came here recently for brunch. Waited for about 20min for a seat. It sucks if you're sitting by the front because people are literally hovering over u waiting. Luckily my friend and I got the last 2 seats on the counter. The food was great. We ordered the katsu sandwich (which was so delicious), the hot cakes (which were also delicious but I would have preferred for them to be a little undercooked), and the egg over rice. Overall, the food was delicious and the two ladies working in the morning and the chef in the back know how to hold it down. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 Star rating is because I noticed we were charged $1 for requesting extra syrup (which was about a 2 second squeeze from a bottle). Not saying that $1 is expensive, but I've personally never dined at a restaurant that charged me extra for requesting more condiments.
Sandy C.}MIDDLE VILLAGE, NY}1}19}26}-1}3}12/26/2017}Came to this place for their hot cakes but was severely disappointed....For a part of 4, we waited 15-30 min for seats which wasn't bad. We ordered the hot cakes, omurice, creamy pasta, and katsu sandwich.The hot cakes were kind of tough. More like cake texture instead of fluffy. The katsu sandwich (which they only have 10 of) was basically a small piece of fried katsu on sandwich bread with sauce. Nothing specialThe creamy pasta was good. It tastes more like seaweed tho which I didn't mind. The omurice was prob the best out of everything. The egg was fluffy and soft and the rice was sticky. The gravy was a good compliment. The bill came out to be around $80 with tip and we were not full LOL would not come back but it was a good experience. Ended up getting some ramen near by
Mariki B.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}16}11}-1}5}12/23/2017}It's a very cute cafe for an afternoon date and a cool sake bar during the evening. Their coffee sets come in dainty teacups and a cool syphon. It is very narrow and seats about 8-10 people. The tiny Japanese style hotcakes (pancakes) were also cute. Will come back again with the girls for Sunday brunch.
Selena Y.}Jersey City, NJ}74}332}1091}18}4}12/19/2017}Small and pricey lunches here, but felt very satisfying. I came for lunch on a Saturday and there was already a small line forming outside the door around 12:30pm. The waiting policy is first-come-first-serve (regardless of party size) and there's no list to put your name down, so make sure you have your whole party with you before you make it to the door.Omurice: if you're here for lunch, this is a must order - slightly sweet and savory fried rice with a fluffy omelette plopped on top. I added a katsu and demi-glace sauce to my order, which was pretty expensive at an additional $8, but it made the meal feel more filling and well-rounded.Katsu sandwich: the restaurant makes only 10 servings of this each day. The dish looks underwhelming at first (it's literally a large fried pork cutlet sandwiched between two slices of white bread), but it's strangely tasty for something so simple. The cutlet was crispy and not oily at all. The small sides of egg salad and pickled vegetables were also a nice touch. Siphon coffee (with Divino Niño Natural beans): Such a unique coffee to watch "brewing", and it tasted very light. I don't normally take my coffee black but this siphon coffee didn't need any sugar or milk at all! The atmosphere overall here is casual yet refined - there's a bit of classic Japanese decor and there's light jazz playing in the background. The dining area is counterspace only, so it can feel a little tight for lunch but it's perfect for their sake bar at night.
Kathy G.}Laguna Niguel, CA}237}157}592}-1}5}12/18/2017}Great omelette rice! I had the original one, the egg was soft and was great with the ketchup fried rice underneath. The dessert was matcha rice crispy, it was the one I recommend even though I haven't tried other ones yet.
Joseph P.}New York, NY}22}312}326}18}4}12/14/2017}Small, sleek, serene, chic high-end sake bar tucked in among the various Asian eateries on East 10th. This place is very special -- $24 for a glass of cold sake?  Yes. And worth it.  There's a quiet seriousness about Hi-Collar that you feel the moment you enter. There Are no tables, just a bar and the bartender pours the sake with quiet grace, reminiscent of Sunday religious services. There's a little bit of food, all wonderfully prepared to satisfy one's hunger. But you come here for the sake and for that, it's a gem.
Se C.}Annandale, VA}209}365}569}18}4}12/14/2017}I was suggested to come here by a friend who had visited NYC recently as well. I've always wanted to try Japanese hotcakes and Omurice. This place offered both. I went by myself on a Saturday around noon. There was a short line and I waited outside about 15 minutes to be seated indoors. The inside is really small. There is a bar style table with a single row that can fit maybe 12 people max at a time. The interior is decorated with shelves stocked with coffee beans, stamps, and the color theme is gold. I ordered the Omurice and I did not get any addition toppings or sauce to come with it besides Ketchup. I think the rice itself was just steamed rice mixed with Ketchup.... I had that when I was a kid and it brought back some memories. Nevertheless, it wasn't shocking or anything. The egg was runny in the center. You can cut the Omelette in half and it'll split in half blanketing the rice. I also had the Hotcakes. They were fluffy and delicious. I paired that with an ice coffee. Total came out to be around $30 plus tip. It was a good lunch. Oh and last thing. They have a cool toilet in the bathroom
Jessica L.}Flushing, NY}318}104}164}18}3}12/8/2017}This is Japanese sake bar at night, but in the day time it's a quaint hipster brunch place. As expected, we did wait about 20-30 min on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30-1pm. It wasn't too bad and goes pretty quickly. The seating is only about 10?12? They have different styles of coffee, aeropress, drip, French, etc! Their coffee is aromatic and different. My friend and I ordered hot cakes to share. I was a little disappointed in this because it was pretty dry.... it's fluffy in a cake like way, but it's not as moist as I would like it honestly. We shared the original omurice which has no sauce but ketchup. When I sliced it down the middle it didn't fall to the sides naturally as I had to help push it a little. (Maybe I'm just expecting a little much since I've seen the videos where they are sliced and fall gracefully open - which btw is oh so satisfying to watch). The taste was pretty good overall. Hi-collar is on the steep side in regards to price, but overall the experience wasn't too bad and the food is pretty good.
Holly Y.}New York, NY}184}46}19}-1}3}11/30/2017}This is a small bar looking restaurant. There are very little seats so there is always a wait. This is great for 1st dates and catching up with a friend. I say this because my boyfriend and I left feeling hungry. We both order our own entree but it was so small. This is great for girls that can't eat and like to instagram their food lol. I had the pancakes because I wanted to see how a fluffy pancake would taste like. It was nothing special.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience. I just wanted more food and I would definitely give it a higher rating lol
Rod B.}Los Angeles, CA}74}108}147}-1}5}11/26/2017}Supper cute place for quick breakfast. It's quite cozy but this just adds to the charm . Get the Niño Divino it's smooth and flavorful. As for their menu . It's very simple mainly omelettes . You can't go wrong with any of them .
Fred K.}Palisades Park, NJ}329}7}14}-1}5}11/26/2017}Love the mentaiko pasta and katsu sandwich!! They also have a beautiful gold bathroom.Always somewhere i come back to time to time
Elizabeth M.}Manhattan, NY}19}115}2}-1}2}11/25/2017}The space is really nice, but the service is slow, not all that friendly, and forgetful. My friend wanted to order a non-alcoholic drink and was informed that "this is a sake bar," and it took about ten minutes to get a glass of water even though there were only six or seven other patrons in the bar. The ginger cocktail I got was tasty, but for $14 I would hope to get a tiny buzz from it. We ordered edamame that never arrived, but I was glad to see that it didn't make an appearance on the bill. I liked the decor, the atmosphere, and, oddly enough, the bathroom. Honestly, the Japanese toilet was probably the best part of the whole experience.
Vincent L.}Oakland, CA}362}3260}7970}18}4}11/22/2017}A compact, gorgeously finished venue that features a long counter seating about 10-12 people at any given time. During the day, this quite a nice café that serves expertly sourced coffee in several methods - pour over, aero press, and siphon. They're also a good place to get some omurice (alternately spelled oh moo rice), which is basically an airy omelet with bacon fried rice inside and a gravy-like tomato sauce all over. It's even more delicious than it sounds. You can even top the omelet further with sausage or their heavenly pork katsu.On that note, their katsu sandwich is quite delicious, if a tad spendy. It's a deceivingly small affair that features a very nice piece of Berkshire pork katsu in between two slices of bread. They only serve 10 of these per day starting at noon.At night, this venue transforms into a lively sake bar. Service is very obliging and efficient in a Japanese way. The clientele is a good mix of Japanese-speaking customers, Asian-Americans, and folks from all walks of life. Definitely worth a stop if you're craving some omurice during the day, or to try out a variety of sake at night.
Angela S.}Manhattan, NY}399}92}45}18}4}11/20/2017}For one, I love the aesthetic of this place. You sit down at a countertop and can see inside the small kitchen where they prepare your food. I've only ever gotten the omurice from here, so I can only speak to that. The egg is fluffy and can be sliced through to reveal a soft fluffy interior that covers your rice. The rice is flavored and appears to be similar to a tomato-y pork rice. You can choose your sauce and whether you want any toppings such as sausage or katsu. From my experience, though, I don't think any toppings are necessary, but I do like to change up the sauce from the regular. My only complaint is that they take SO long to prepare the food. It always takes at least 30-40 minutes for my food to come out, and I can see why. They only have one stove in the back and one person cooking.
Brian H.}Roslyn, NY}2}7}0}-1}5}11/3/2017}The atmosphere is definitely quaint, but carries a clear sense of refinement. Their food is really good, and going by what I know, is quite close to the native Japanese food palette.Most recently, I had the siphon coffee, which is only served until dinner service starts. It was really delicious with a clean, pleasant taste. I definitely recommend it if you're in the area!
Kate F.}Princeton, NJ}126}321}21}18}4}10/31/2017}I'm not sure that waiting in a long line was the right choice, but the omurice was comforting with a perfectly done omelet. The bacon to rice ratio was not as generous as I was hoping, and the rice could've had a little more flavor built in. The ambiance was pleasing - calm and efficient - and I love a washlet toilet! Made me miss Japan.
Toktam R.}San Diego, CA}243}30}52}-1}5}10/30/2017}I tried the fruit sandwich and it was mind blowing, and I wish I could try everything that she was making look DAAAMMMM GOOD, love love this little cute place
frani l.}Austin, TX}134}26}2}-1}5}10/28/2017}Feels like we stepped into Japan, perfect spot for a pre-dinner Sake or Sake cocktail. Love this intimate place, perfect for date night.
Meir B.}Brooklyn, NY}192}38}6}-1}5}10/28/2017}Best coffee I have ever had. The wait was well worth it and I'll be back again! The baristas were very knowledgeable and very kind. 6 stars from me :)
Christina H.}Amsterdam, The Netherlands}25}7}14}-1}5}10/25/2017}Demi glance source is perfect for me! The price is good as well. Elegant bar seats as well. The waiters are Japanese.
Dan H.}Cherry Hill, NJ}101}117}342}-1}4}10/25/2017}A bit of Japanese nostalgia for those who have travelled to Japan.  For those who have not, will enjoy the atmosphere but may not notice the subtle nuances of the services.A mixed bag of decor and design with golds embellished in some of the drinkware and counter top, Japanese style sliding doors, shelves lined with matchbooks from assorted establishments to the two ladies behind the counter, one wearing a bowler hat, the other a fedora.Deciding to go for brunch, we arrived at the opening moment (as should you).  With seating for about fifteen people, the place fills up easily with a queue starting shortly after opening.The menu offers various coffee drinks with the option to select the type of bean used.  I went with a syphon coffee, which is made by boiling water over a small flame which forces the water into an upper chamber meeting the freshly ground coffee for an extremely enjoyable cup of joe.Food items also vary with a few items in limited quantity (fried pork cutlet sandwich).  Crispy on the outside, juicy and ever so slightly pink on the inside.  It is served with homemade pickled vegetables.The omurice is a dish of wonder.  A soft omelet is perched atop a variation of fried rice, usually seasoned with a red sauce, or ketchup.  This version had pieces of bacon mixed in which added a nice smokey, fatty component.  The omelet, once placed, is drizzled with a demiglace sauce before being served.  It is a mixed bag of sweet and savory all in one.  Whilst forks are provided, this dish is best eaten with a spoon to ensure all of the flavors are enjoyed.Fluffy Japanese style pancakes have the pleasing look of a delicate cake and are just as delicious.  Flavors comparable to a well made pancake at other establishments.  This plate is presented with syrup and yuzu butter.They also have a few sweets for those seeking a more balanced meal complemented with tea.  A small layered cake with whipped cream and berries looked as decadent aa it did light.One of the biggest enjoyments came from the toilet in the bathroom.  A Japanese style toilet with a heated seat and full system bidet (a perk I was unsure of during our time overseas, but one I came to enjoy).  It looks like a futuristic space chair, but rest assured it is quite comfortable.Hi Collar opens at 11am on Saturdays.  If you arrive there a little late, be prepared to wait a bit, but know that you are in for a special treat.
Alice L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}191}905}-1}5}10/23/2017}Super stoke to come here! The line is always out the door when you come during the evening. I came about 5 minutes after it open around 11AM on a Saturday. Almost half the seating area was already filled (including me and my sibling). Keep in mind, this is a very narrow place. The seating is literally an isle. You do get to hang you coat behind you or under the table near where you sit. The place is had a vintage feel to it due to the accessories and decorations. The utensils were a vintage set, which matched their atmosphere. There is an elegant feel to this place. What blew my mind was the food and the way they made coffee. They didn't use a regular coffee maker but by a vacuum coffee maker. Water was placed on the bottom while the grind coffee beans were on top. Through condensation, the two switched places in a matter of time. It was pretty cool to watch.Food: ORIGINAL OMURICE: basically a bed of rice with a soft omelet and ketchup drizzled all over. - Taste amazing: it was so soft and the umami flavor was so good. it wasn't too salty, too heavy and was still runny in the center when I cut it open. The rice was heavily packed together. When you place your utensil in between the rice, the shape holds. They really pack the rice together. It's very filling. DETOX TEA: blend of many tea leaves- It was so relaxing drinking this tea. It came hot and the staff warned me to wait since the cup was burning hot too. It was the perfect balance of tea. it was not strong like black tea but not weak either.HOTCAKES with LEMON BUTTER:- THE BEST hot cake here. It's made in front of you on a griddle rather than in the back of the kitchen. It's so fluffy and light. The lemon butter just makes it even tastier. It's a must have when you come here. You do not need a lot of syrup to go with these hot cakes. It's good on its own. the inside was not dry, not dense, and cooked perfectly. COFFEE with HANA BEANS:You get to choose your choice of beans, which was pretty cool. I'm not a coffee drinker but my sibling was. I took a sip and it was too strong for me (since I'm not a coffee drink). Thus, I do not recommend something as strong as this for non-coffee drinkers. BUT if you are a coffee drinker, this is good for you as my sibling said it was not weak nor too strong where you would feel all jittery.Only downside: too much ketchup on that omurice.
Joseph C.}Brooklyn, NY}16}66}1}18}4}10/23/2017}Nice place. 4 stars is more for the decor and service rather than the food. I ordered the omelette. It was very pretty, i just wished it was as runny and gooey as it looked.The sauce that came with it was outstanding though.  All and all, it was still good just not worth going over the bridge for.
Susan X.}Claremont, CA}5}367}152}-1}4}10/21/2017}Katsu sandwich-good. Not that special overall. Soft and chewy bread. Average quality of katsu sauce. Good quality of Berkshire pork. Could have been more juicy. Tasty egg salad. Chopped celery and red pepper in sour and savory sauce. Small portion. Pretty pricey.
Gwen Y.}New York, NY}106}28}34}-1}4}10/18/2017}This place is really cool. For a while, I felt like I was in a coffee bar in Tokyo instead of the village. Big props to the owner/designer. A great place to bring a date to for some coffee or in my case, brunch. Take note! They only seat you when your entire party is here. Also, as the place is very small, and they have limited bar seating, it's not advisable to come in groups of more than two. I ordered the omurice with sausage and some fluffy hot cakes. I think they were out of the katsu sandwiches for the day as we stopped by pretty late in the day (around 2pm). When you order your omurice, you get to choose what sauce you want your rice to be done with, original, which is a tomato base sauce,  cream sauce or demi glacé sauce, which I believe has Worcestershire sauce in it. Afterwards, you can choose additional toppings such as cheese, sausage, kinoko or katsu. I ordered original with the sausage which ran about $13.50. Considering the portion and ingredients, it was a pretty expensive dish. The rice was perfectly cooked, each grain coated in the delicious sauce. My friend ordered the demi glace which I actually preferred. The katsu tasted a little dry although it was very crispy. The egg omelette was not as liquidy as I had expected but nonetheless tasted great. The hot cakes were a little dry but very fluffy.  For dessert we had the ohagi, which is Mochi with red bean paste, roasted soybean flour and green seaweed. The sweet and salty flavors complemented each other perfectly and was a unique taste!
Ami Y.}New York, NY}170}139}76}-1}2}10/17/2017}I've known about this place for a long time but still beat the bush around. I finally entered the place recently because I've finally succumbed to my craving for the omelette rice. TBH the food here let me down. The omelette rice was too heavy/fatty/bland for my taste. Although the menu said the rice contained bacons, it must have been so tiny because I couldn't taste it at all.Also I find it incredible that the place is still functioning despite how small it is. Everyone is crammed into the counter, sitting side by side, which is pretty uncomfortable. Obviously the food is overpriced as most restaurants are in NYC, but since there are many places with better food where I can dine more comfortably, I don't think I will return.
April C.}New York, NY}2}98}277}-1}5}10/13/2017}Will definitely come back for their juicy katsu dishes and coffee. Loved their mentai pasta, too. Don't come with a group! Small place.
Gabriella S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}1}10/10/2017}Very disappointed experience... The food is definitely below average, if you want to taste rice blended with ketchup, please try. Don`t forgot, they also add HAIR in it!!They remade a rice for me after I saw there`s hair in it, so I still gave them about 13% tip. When I paid and went out, the waitress seems very unsatisfied and didn't even greet me like any other restaurants will do, no "thank you", no "goodbye". Maybe it`s just a Japanese usual manner which I just can`t get used to.
Celine Y.}Brooklyn, NY}129}20}11}-1}4}10/4/2017}Everything about Hi-Collar is super cute. Luckily for me, I did not have to wait when I came in for brunch. Between two people, we had the omurice with katsu and mentai cream pasta. The pasta was amazing and we were completely stuffed (we could barely finish)! Their iced coffee is also worth a try. The only thing that was kind of strange for me was having to move down that table as seats cleared up to accommodate different parties of people. It was kind of awkward because I had to shift three times during my meal, but I suppose that's what happens when the place only seats 10 people. I would definitely come back to try the katsu sandwich and hot cakes.
Christina Z.}New York, NY}901}355}342}18}1}9/24/2017}They should call it "Last come, last served"...please read our experience below.Service here is unreasonably inequitable. Even though we were in before 6 people, they started orders from the end of the bar in - this is disrespectful of people who had waited in line longed, since it forces us to wait for our food even longer, especially since we were ready to order immediately when we sat down (after an hour waiting outside staring at the menu).Either they need to keep track of the TRUE "first come, first serve", or they should implement a name sign-in so that they know where to start taking orders in the correct order of first actual to come and stand in line, first actually served their food.At this point the whole shebang has been over 2 hours and no food yet.On what has been received:The fruit shake is really skimping on you, since you mostly get ice and 3 sips of juice, rather than an actual shake. On top of that, you're paying $6 for it. $2/sip is a HUGE JOKE for something that says fresh seasonal fruits that were actually canned mandarin orange and canned peaches. The only fresh aspect was the banana.They should think about a better system and also hire more help. 2 people doing orders / drinks / hot cakes and one guy doing EVERYTHING else is ridiculous, even for a 10-seating situation. They should also properly train the guy in the back since he clearly didn't know how to cook things in order.Overall, this place was not first come, first serve...rather a LAST come, First served.--Addendum to food (once finally received):The omurice has no flavor in the rice itself, especially given I probably only had 1 piece of bacon in the entire dish. The omelet itself was indeed fluffy, though. It's really sad that they charge you $13 for this, make you wait 1 hour after seating, and then the katsu on top ($6) wasn't even made in house (the curry place next door supplies it).The hot cakes were nice, but unfortunately they forgot to put the toppings we asked for in it (chocolate chip & walnut) - when they made the mistake, they offered to put the toppings on top...yet still charge us full price for their own mistake. I was already irate with having to wait after 6 people who came in AFTER us was served first, and the galls that they'd charge me for their employee's mistake. I suggested if they wanted to, we'd take the wrong order if they didn't charge for the toppings and they said no, it's still the same when it's on top of or inside (no it is most definitely not). I was about to just say no to the hot cake in its entirety at this point and just walk out, when the lady came back and offered me exactly what she just said no to a second ago.Really frustrating experience on the whole. Had wanted and hoped for better given the general vibe and reviews.
Maggie L.}New York, NY}280}72}153}-1}4}9/22/2017}This is such a cute little place. However there might be a bit of wait since there aren't enough seats. I loved the omurice but wasn't a fan of the pasta. There were tons of things I wanted to try but couldn't do I'd definitely be back.
Dylan T.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}9/16/2017}Amazing Japanese Bar! The ambience feels like I'm in a movie. The bar tender was really polite and well-dressed. His serving was very professional too! He noticed that we wanted to order omurice when it wasn't available (only before 4pm) and suggested an alternative. He also let us try sake samples at the end of the meal. I'd totally recommend everyone to this place.
Julia Y.}Santa Clara, CA}33}93}33}18}5}9/15/2017}This place is fantastic. Came here by myself when my friend was running late for lunch. The place is very clean and cozy. They had omurice, which I fully plan to order next time I'm in the city!I had ordered a tea here. Great for coming to hang with a friend or significant other. Not setup to handle groups. Or come by yourself. I could sit by the bar and read a book while drinking a hot tea!
Lena J.}Princeton, NJ}226}129}816}18}3}9/8/2017}Coffee is good, food is average.-Mizudashi cold brew is good!-omurice is fine-hot cakes are dry and not so good-some food is made off-site and reheated-super cute cups and dishware-the toilet is so coolI had been to Hi-Collar once and had their omurice with a friend over a year and a half ago, and recently we came back for a weekday lunch. Last time we came there was only one other person there, so we were both surprised that it had gotten so popular - by 11:30 all the seats were full!We ordered two types of omurice, two coffees, and the hot cakes. While we were eating, a large box of already cooked katsu was brought in, so some of the food is definitely cooked off-site and reheated. In order that we got the items:Cold brew Mizudashi iced coffee ($4) - this was pretty good cold brew, definitely our favorite item we tried today! I didn't realize this until later but I think Mizudashi just means it's standard cold brew? The price looks standard too until you realize that the serving size is quite small...Iced siphon coffee ($8.80) - I got this with counter culture TKO beans (+$2.50); anything other than their house blend is extra. It was really cool to watch this being made, and I'm not a coffee expert, but while it was good it didn't taste too different from standard iced coffee. I liked the cold brew much more and wouldn't spend $11+ on this again. (Sorry good beans and effort were wasted on me...)(I think they mainly use Hario products by the way!)Omurice ($11 or $13) - rice was nice and firm, but the ketchup wasn't evenly distributed (some spots were basically white) and there was barely any bacon inside :( the egg was nice and soft and fluffy, less liquid-y than the Bar Moga version. Overall pretty good though not remarkable; I think this and Bar Moga are about on par (Hi-Collar is cheaper and has more options but I like Moga's omelette more) so either is worth a try if you haven't had it before!Hot cakes ($9.50) - they came out nice and hot and were pretty fluffy but also really dry and the taste kind of reminded me of packaged mix. The tops and bottoms were also quite hard and dry :( the syrup that came with it tasted like the artificial kind that comes in a bottle, and it was too sweet to add to the already slightly sweet hot cakes. They look so cute, but I regret getting them as they were pricey and I didn't enjoy eating them.There was basically one person (not sure if I should refer to her as a barista?) behind the counter making all the drinks and serving the food. It seemed really hectic for her, but there isn't room for more than one person there.
Hannah L.}New York, NY}229}232}604}18}5}8/29/2017}My new favorite brunch spot. Food is served between 11a - 4p, after which time the lights dim and this place turns into a sake bar. Space - Bar seating only. Does not take reservations in advance or names at the door. If you want to get in through these doors, you'll have to wait single file outside. Original Omurice - Ketchup rice topped with a perfectly cooked omelet and some more ketchup. This is what every omurice should be. There are options to add sausage, mushrooms, cheese, and other toppings, but I went with the original this time. Japanese Hot Cakes - Ordered my hotcakes with bananas inside. Came with a side of maple syrup and butter. Hot cake heaven. I've heard the siphon coffee is amazing, but haven't tried it yet. Will definitely be frequenting this place on the weekends.
Laura V.}New York, NY}2}23}0}-1}5}8/23/2017}Such a hidden gem, love the service, food and ambiance.Got three plates, the omurice traditional, the katsu sandwich and the hot cakes filled with banana. Wasn't able to sit down until about 12:30, but there were still katsu sandwiches available, so don't fret too much!
Foodie E.}Copenhagen, Denmark}4}111}100}-1}3}8/15/2017}Came for the Japanese Hot Cakes. It's so hard to find super thick fluffy pancakes in the city. I was excited to find this place makes some but bummed that they weren't anything to brag about. It's not that the pancakes were bad. They just weren't the type of pancakes I would crave for. Still glad I got to try them out though.If you're looking for some yummy fluffy pancakes that make you want to come back for more then try Noma Kitchen in Soho.
乃馨}New York, NY}48}74}304}-1}4}8/15/2017}Perfect place for loners. The atmosphere is really nice - relaxing music, coffee aroma and warm hostess. Their omurice is creamy and delicious, and I especially enjoy the sauce. I hope they have a larger portion for katsu since it's 6 dollars.
Emanuel M.}New York, NY}32}7}61}-1}5}8/11/2017}One of the best experiences in New York, I would recommend this place to any person I meet "Telling them it's the first place to visit." The first bite of the emu rice took me to a new level of flavor that I will never forget every bite made me feel sad that the experience was coming to a close. The service was polite, thoughtful and not to mention courteous.
Lettie L.}Toronto, Canada}51}92}27}18}4}8/3/2017}Extremely charming, a mix of Japanese bar, and European cafe feeling, no detail is overlooked. Servers are non stop moving yet still keep a smile on their faces. The food is simple but delicate, every bite is a joy. The siphon coffee is like a science experiment and a show. I'd go back in a heart beat. Would love to come back to have drinks in the evenings. Tip: Try to arrive before noon to beat the rush of people.
Billy C.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}400}189}723}18}4}8/2/2017}11AM - 4PM are the hours you'll want to come here for food. After that it turns into a sake bar that serves mediocre stuff that you don't see on Yelp, except in my review, since I did go in during the wee hours and expected to get a delicious omurice. Let's get with the breakdown: Hi-Collar 11AM-4PM:Place - the super small cramped space can only accommodate around 10 people on a counter seated table. Expect it to be busy during lunch, since the gap to get the omurice is only several hours. Drinks - Hi-Collar iced tea which is an apricot iced tea unsweetened. It was OK but for the price, I would skip and stick to water. Food - get the omurice!! I ordered the following:Omurice with the Demi-glacé sauce topped with some katsu - wow. It was good ! The egg was fluffy and delicious. The tomato sauce rice with bacon was hearty and the katsu has a good bite and crisp to it. The demi sauce is also a great choice to wrap it all together. I also ordered  (HAS TO BE AFTER 12PM) & (because they only have 10 servings per day) the Katsu sandwich, to see what the hype is about and why it was so limited. The sandwich comes out in a very soft white bread that has the sides precut for you. The thick pork cutlet katsu is accompanied with a brown sauce and a relish sauce on the side as well. The katsu was good but overall the sandwich was just OK. I would recommend to SKIP this. Hi-Collar 5PM & ON:The place becomes a sake bar with a Japanese guy with very cool hair that serves you. Come in to drink like a fish but avoid the food. I had come in here late night hoping to score the above omurice but ended up getting the hi-collar rice, which was horrible. It comes out in a small circular bowl with rice, egg, sauce and other stuff I want to forget. Come in during 11AM-4PM & get the omurice. PERIOD.
hannah k.}Los Angeles, CA}15}23}16}-1}5}7/31/2017}Great presentation with relaxing atmosphere. This is a sake tasting bar that is intimate. Highly recommend for a date night or catching up with friends. A relaxed space where you can sip on wine and enjoy tasty food, while being able to hear your partner.
Alan N.}San Gabriel, CA}250}14}1}-1}5}7/29/2017}We came here on a friends recommendation for brunch. One thing I noticed was that when we got here at opening there was already 2 couples waiting outside, so be prepared to wait. The inside decor was very authentic and both owners (I assume) were both Japanese. We ordered the omurice with katsu and mushroom on top. The egg was cooked to perfection and katsu was amazing as well. I don't drink much coffee, but they have a very unique coffee making gadget worth trying for all coffee lovers. We wanted to try the Japanese pancakes, but we were too full after the meal. Definitely would recommend for an authentic Japanese cuisine experience.
Thao P.}New York, NY}0}1}7}-1}4}7/22/2017}I ordered the omu rice with demiglace sauce and sausage, the sausage is relatively smaller than expected but the rice and the eggs are rich in flavor and texture, yummy lunch for a saturday morning, very filling.
Leah S.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}7/22/2017}Arrived at 1pm on a Tuesday for lunch, my friend and I waited about 15 minutes for two seats at the bar. I ordered the hotcakes and the cold brew iced coffee. Although they were a bit pricey at roughly $9, the hotcakes were absolutely amazing. They were light, fluffy, but still filling enough that my hunger was satisfied. I wish I could have these hotcakes every day. The cold brew iced coffee was also pretty good, definitely better quality compared to local coffee chains. You can also order take-out! While I was there, a woman came in and asked if she could have the omurice to go, and the waitress gladly accommodated her. The only downsides to Hi-Collar are the lack of seating and the fact that they don't take reservations. However, these cons are part of their identity at this point, and it definitely makes for a unique experience.
Tracy W.}New York, NY}338}52}39}18}5}7/21/2017}LOVE this place. Came here for lunch on a Friday. The place is small with only bar seating and no tables. I did not have to wait at all though. The lunch menu is small but contains everything you'd ever want. The omurice comes with many different options for how it's prepared. I went with classic with a sausage on top, and it was prepared perfectly! My favorite part of my meal was the hot cakes. So freaking delicious and sweeter/fluffier than regular American pancakes. I was disappointed with the iced coffee however. For how pricey it is, I expected better, but it was on the watery side.
Su L.}Manhattan, NY}79}121}437}18}4}7/12/2017}Delicious omurice! The cafe is super cute and reminiscent of a hipster cafe in Japan. Coffee is interesting, and service is friendly and professional.
M S.}Queens, NY}1}12}4}-1}1}7/12/2017}An open letter to the staff of Hi-Collar.Do you talk bad about customers in front of their faces if you were in Japan? No? Then why would you do that to New Yorkers? You think all of us don't speak Japanese because we don't look like we do? Please stop talking trash about us in front of our faces in Japanese. Just.. it's the most basic rule in the service industry. None of your "high-quality" coffee/bar theme is worthwhile if the staff is rude. If you absolutely cannot contain your trash-talking, please at least do it quietly in the kitchen, for pete's sake.For all non-Japanese speaking people considering eating at this joint: you may think the establishment is fancy and cool. However, there is a good chance the smiling staff in front of you is laughing about your fashion sense or complaining about something petty like the amount of food you ordered.
You Z.}New York, NY}9}51}72}-1}5}7/11/2017}Lovely. The place is tiny and you probably would have to wait outside without your name being written down. Just wait. After that all nice little things will delight you.The food and drinks will be beautifully presented in unique plates and cups; the flavors are balanced which makes it a great brunch, afternoon tea or light dinner. You should try the siphon coffee if you haven't because the process itself is interesting and delightful to watch. For the heavenly hot cakes, inside banana is a good addition. The accompany orange flavored butter is mixed in house -- I wish I could buy some.. The omelette are made the Japanese way. Katsu or sausage are both good choices for meat lovers :)
Elliot T.}New York, NY}127}127}4}-1}4}7/10/2017}I have been wanting to try this place after seeing a video of the omelet rice that is so fluffy, it opens up and wraps around the rice like a flower blooming when cut straight down the middle. Of course I had to give it a try when I ordered the omelet rice and it did not look as magical as expected but the food was still good. I got the demi glaze with a katsu on top, it was good and ended up being around $20. The space is pretty small with only a bar counter top but the decor is an old fashion colonial Japanese atmosphere with classical music in the background. This is a good place to try but I would probably order other items next time. The omelet was good but kind of pricey.
Sherise K.}South Ozone Park, NY}24}101}659}18}4}7/9/2017}THE HOTCAKES. HOLY. SHIT. They are worth the trip!  The biggest gripe is it's very small and you're seated at the bar.
Gokce S.}San Diego, CA}0}2}0}-1}1}7/8/2017}Waited for 30 minutes for my food to come and the lady kept saying it was being prepared. Ended up cancelling my order and leaving, definitely not worth the wait. I also tried their matcha, which was not even original and overpriced. I definitely don't recommend this place.
Jainnielyn C.}Queens, NY}108}156}499}18}4}7/3/2017}OMG. How is this possible. Imagine the best scrambled egg you've had, double the deliciousness. We arrived a little over noon on a Saturday, and there was a long line outside. Seeing that the place is tiny (12-seat counter?) it's a surprise that the line moves quickly. Inside, it's a cute little space manned by Japanese people. I can almost imagine being in Tokyo.It took a while for them to take our order (It felt like 15 mins. to hungry people), but food came quickly. And then the magic happened. Super fluffy egg omelette on a bed of rice.Original - Topped with ketchup with a tang (a little bbq?) A great contrast to the fluffy egg.Demi-glace - Deep savory brown sauce. Seems like it would be great with katsu.Personally, I think original is better - creamy egg, acidity of the ketchup. But to each their own!
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}2}6/28/2017}Disclaimer: This is a review for Hi-Collar's lunch hours only.I don't think this joint is managed efficiently, nor do I think they have enough staff. Weekend lunch hour lines are horrendously long. You have to wait outside, there isn't a wait list sheet or any sign that signifies that. Occasionally, the staff acting as the barista would come out for a head count and accept the next customer in line. There are probably around 10 seats at this single bar table-only joint. Yet service is severely lacking. Orders were forgotten, water was never refilled, and the kitchen takes forever. The coffee is indeed good, but was overpriced. Following the same theme, so were the lunch food items. The omurice is small portioned and its demi glace version is $13. If you want to tack on a small sausage link, that'll be an extra $2.5. If you want miniature slices of katsu (probably around 1/8 the size of normal katsu), that's an extra $6. Overall, Hi-Collar is a nice concept, but there's lots of kinks to work out, and the prices don't justify the goods.
Dong K.}Jersey City, NJ}106}69}9}-1}1}6/26/2017}I'm sure coffee is great here.  i'm just not a coffee guy.  asked for cream, clearly they were not happy with that request.  Then they proceeded to talk sht about us in Japanese, but too bad one of us understand Japanese.  i'm sorry i ruined your fancy coffee with half-n-half.  thought i get to drink coffee how i want it and not be judged for it.  anyway, if you are really into coffee and you enjoy your coffee black, this is probably a great place.  just not for me.oh there was a guy(i think he works there- he seemed to have stopped by when he was not working) had this amazing punk rock style elvis hair cut.  great hair!!
Jessica T.}Brooklyn, NY}89}20}9}-1}5}6/26/2017}Ryo here is an awesome bartender (and an even better makeup artist on the side). The sake selection is extensive - the seating is pretty limited (only bar seats) so come early to get a seat. They're also awesome at recommending sake if you're not familiar with the different types.
Heidi V.}Brooklyn, NY}23}39}94}-1}5}6/22/2017}Beautiful interior with Japanese architecture and arts on the walls. Every little detail, down to the plates the food is served on to the utensils is carefully catered and selected. Only downside is that the counter only has limited seating, so I usually get stuff to do. The food here is better than the coffee, but the coffee and tea is spectacular. However, if you come here, you must try the katsu sandwich and the omu rice. The two best things on the menu. I cannot wait to come back here and try something else off their menu!
Yi M.}Cambridge, MA}84}11}26}-1}3}6/18/2017}The egg is fluffy and the sausage is juicy. The sauce tastes like baked beans without beans. I also ordered hot cake with strawberries but it is literally two strawberries for $1.75. Everything is well presented.
Monica F.}Manhattan, NY}65}53}134}-1}5}6/18/2017}I really enjoy coming to Hi-collar. The space is tiny with only few seats and a counter. Staff is very friendly and quick. The food is amazing. The omurice is a must try. The omelette is fluffy, runny and delicious. I had the katsu as an add on and it was very flavorful. Will try the sandwich next time as the katsu on the omurice was a tease. The hot cakes were also very good. So extremely fluffy with a crispy edges. Perfection :)
Marcy M.}New York, NY}120}128}265}18}4}6/18/2017}I have come here on separate occasions for both the coffee and the sake. This is a tiny place with seating for less than 20 people at a bar. During the day, bar displays different coffees and at night, the panels slide across to cover the coffee and display the sake. There are plenty of options of both and a small meal menu too. I knocked off a star because the food the omu rice was pretty average and the tomato was really ketchup and there were maybe two tiny bits of bacon in the entire thing. It was like a giant piece of sushi with egg on it and ketchup. I'm sure it would have been better with the chicken on top. I brought one of my friends here at night and both of us pretty much known nothing about sake. Our bartender was AMAZING and extremely helpful in describing the differences and let us taste several different ones to note differences before ordering. One last thing is the bathroom is very neat and tidy here. The toilet has different functions which I'm not entirely sure how you use but it's definitely a talking point whenever someone returns from the bathroom.
Alexander K.}Columbus, GA}343}101}190}18}5}6/18/2017}This traditional Japanese Speak Easy is a gem in the wall establishment tucked behind a fine Japanese dining establishment.  With a speak easy vibe to it, you may find this little bar tucked right in where they have a wide variety of delicious Japanese Sake and cocktails!  As soon as you walk, you can see a bar backed shot glasses and bartenders dressed up.  There isn't just standing room and maybe about 18 high bar chairs.  They offer a beer and cocktail menu as well as a food menu with authentic Japanese small plates and entrees.  We got the Tako (Japanese for octopus) wasabi for a small dish along with the diamond dust bottle of Sake. It gave us about 16 sake glasses worth to share amongst 4 of us.  Service here is impeccable and very deliberate.  This Bar area also has a special gem of a bathroom to include a throne with TOTO bidet.
Yp L.}New Brunswick, NJ}0}2}0}-1}2}6/17/2017}Good food with Bad service.Without considering service, I would like rate four stars: not perfect, but really worth to have a try. Katsu sandwich and hot cake were pretty good.  But service really concerns the experience. There were only two waitresses, serving as well as cooking. I understood they were busy, but I and my friend were almost ignored all the time. We weren't served water for a long time until we asked for it (but other customers were served as soon as they arrived). The two staffs kept prattling loudly, which made me uncomfortable, since I have never been a restaurant or cafe where staffs were louder than all of the customers. In the end, we finished all the dishes and asked to check, placing the credit card in a little wooden plate. Ignorance continued. They took the plate after about ten minutes even one of the staffs was just infront of us. My friend said she felt upset for the cold attitude, me either.Anyway I won't come again.
Nikki L.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}0}9}1}-1}4}6/15/2017}The egg in the omurice was good, the rice itself was soggy and overly peppery. The atmosphere was great, but why is it so hot and stuffy??
Hsinyeh H.}Columbia, MO}1}30}2}-1}5}6/14/2017}It's a pleasant experience in a cozy Japanese cafe. Their signature dish is omurice. It's perfect for brunch. My happy finish is with the dessert containing all the traditional elements, Ohagi, and siphon coffee. However, omurice is only available till 4pm. Since the cafe is tiny, you might need to wait in line outside for seats. But, it's worth it!
Megan O.}Santa Barbara, CA}138}64}70}-1}5}6/14/2017}Good lord this place is amazing! Welcome to brunch heaven complete with jazz music playing in the background and a truly personalized eating experience. This is one of the few times that I can say my meal was actually made with love.First off every coffee is made individually and served in the most gorgeous copper mugs. Tres fancy. Not to mention you can add two scoops of gelato to said iced coffee, must return to drink that deliciousness. This place is tiny, like sits maybe 12 people at the counter tiny. Get here early or be prepared to wait-but alas, it's worth it. The hot cakes are a thing of dreams. You get two fluffy clouds of deliciousness that are SO GOOD you don't even need syrup. Seriously. But in case you don't feel like going to carb heaven, indulge in one of the omelettes served over rice, you'll have no regrets. If I had to pick my last meal on earth, this just might be it.Unrelated, the bathroom looks like something out of The Great Gatsby.
Miki F.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}6/12/2017}Omurice was good, but I had one of the most uncomfortable dining experience at this cafe. The owner and the employees were rudely judging and talking horribly about the customers in front of their face in Japanese (i.e. That old hag's manner is disgusting, that couple only ordered one dessert between them - what a waste of seat, etc.) The owner knew I spoke Japanese because I ordered my food in Japanese - so when she noticed my glance towards them, she used secret phrase/keywords (which were quite obvious making me cringe hard) to let them know that there are Japanese customers sitting in seat xx. The employees then went on saying how they're going to be written up again, which I'm assuming on review sites, so I'm pretty sure I wasn't imagining things. Yeah. Never again.
Elizabeth K.}New York, NY}283}112}41}18}5}6/11/2017}What a cute, cozy place to hang out with some friends and eat amazing food. We were a party of 4 and got really lucky with the wait time. It worked out and only had to wait about 10 minutes. The staff was so so nice too. We all had iced coffee and they served them in Moscow mule cups which was so cute. Did I mention the decor of the place was lovely?! We got a mix of brunch entrees. I got the pork katsu sandwich and I highly recommend getting it if it's in stock. They only make about 10 or so a day. It was delicious and really different than what I would usually get. My friends got the hot cakes which were also amazing - nice and fluffy and made right to order. The omelette was really interesting and quite different with the rice underneath. I'm so glad my friend recommended this place but I definitely wouldn't suggest having more than a party of 3-4. Ideal is 2 just because they only have limited bar seating.We didn't get dessert but a lot of people were ordering the gelato and iced coffee. I would definitely come back again!!
Sam B.}West Orange, NJ}284}8}0}-1}1}6/8/2017}what started out as a perfectly fine dinner (thursday eve june 8th) ended with horrible, pretentious, and inconsiderate comments from the dude behind the bar. we had some pleasant banter at the beginning of the meal but towards the end he got wildly offended that i used a 6oz water tumbler as a dish to take a taste of my partners soup out of. clearly this isn't proper etiquette- but since we didn't have any split bowls i thought there wouldnt be any harm/ after all it's just a cortado-size water glass... he went out to spew some pretentious shit about leaving my chopsticks in the cup (IN BETWEEN BITES) i am a huge fan of japanese cuisine and consider it a passion of mine so i know it is rude to leave your chopsticks in a bowl of rice etc. but at the end of the day i'm a customer paying 100 dollars for drinks and food- i don't need some dude trying to shame me for imperfect etiquette. there is a difference between polite constructive advice and just being an asshole. i should have tipped him zero but i left 25% because that's the right thing to do. i'm not sure i'll be going back after being shamed in front if my partner, brother, and friend. pathetic move dude.
CY W.}Manhattan, NY}21}21}34}-1}4}6/8/2017}I loved everything at this place. Except the ridiculous wait. My friends ordered the omurice and the pancakes, while I had the mentaiko pasta. I tried some of the omurice and while the idea of ketchup fried rice doesn't sound appealing to me, the ketchup flavor wasn't too strong in this one. In fact, it was delicious...! The mentaiko pasta was a little on the fishy side but I suppose that's cod roe for you. I still enjoyed it though. It wasn't too creamy or heavy. My other friend had the pancakes. It wasn't as jiggly or fluffy as we thought but it was ok. Most days when I walk by, there's a crazy line out the door due to limited seating and no reservations. I would definitely go back if there wasn't a ridiculous wait. I mean it's good, but not an hour wait good
Jin K.}Englewood, NJ}154}50}40}-1}5}6/1/2017}If you want a true Japanese sake experience this is the spot. They have one bar that seats 12 or so people so be sure to come early if you don't want to wait. They have a vast selection of sakes and a few small dishes. I did not know much about sakes and the bartender allowed me to sample 3 different types and explained them all throughly. The experience was worth the price tag. The ambiance of the bar and professionalism of the bartenders alone sets this place apart from others.I ordered one sake and a grilled beef tongue which went well with the sake. During the day time the bar transforms into a coffee shop where they serve coffee, tea, sandwiches and omurice! I actually came the following Tuesday for some afternoon coffee after lunch. I ordered the siphon coffee which was much different that a classic drip. They offer a variety of coffee beans. I ordered their own blend which was good! It definitely is a more expensive cup of coffee but the experience, ambiance, and taste are worth it. I will be back again in the future for both coffee and sake!
Huayong Wing W.}Nashville, TN}87}5}13}-1}5}5/28/2017}Fluffy katsu omurice!! The fried pork steak is so good, not too oily. The egg is fluffy, and taste super good with ketchup, bacon, and rice. I also tried their matcha au lait, and it's creamy and has good balance with lightly bitter matcha and sweet milk.
Russell K.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}5}5/23/2017}One of New York's best sake bars after 6 pm, this is THE place to go to learn about sake. With just 13 seats at the bar, you'll be guided through the entire experience by your bartender, who will suggest sales and offer tastes. Although the Sake isn't cheap, they are very generous in letting you taste a few bottles before you choose one. The food, although not the centerpiece, is definitely worth checking out as well.This place is ALWAYS an adventure - you won't be disappointed.
Anna L.}Philadelphia, PA}8}49}363}-1}4}5/22/2017}This place is small, simple and friendly.  Came here for lunch around 11:45 on a chilly rainy not a nice day to be in the city type of day.  This is important because we were able to get the pork katsu sandwich. They only make 10 of these bad boys and we did not want be disappointed.  There were 3 other people there so we knew we were going to get it.  The sandwich was warm, crunchy, juicy with the perfect amount of sauce. Although it was on white bread the sauce or the hot katsu did make the bread soggy or fall apart. Yum. The rice was good but I definitely had better. The best fluffiest and creamiest egg you will ever have in your lifetime.  I can't tell you about the flavor of the eggs because i was too preoccupied by the cream sauce and too full from my sandwich but the eggs texture is amazing (if you like cloud like eggs) The cream sauce balanced the tangy rice perfectly but I felt like something was missing.  Maybe I should of gotten the original or demi glazed.  I'll go back and try a few of they're coffees and maybe the famous pasta.
Rose R.}Manhattan, NY}120}2}0}-1}1}5/21/2017}Food is okay. The Service is Absurd! "Wait outside and no idea about how long is the waiting time!" The old waitress shout at my friend and me.The owner should hire someone who have basic knowledge of how to behave like normal human being!
Dorothy Y.}Brooklyn, NY}1}31}58}-1}4}5/20/2017}Saturday 1:30 pm, cloudy and chilly Got a seat for 2 right away. It's a very cozy place and I agree that only come in 1 or 2 people. Got the original omurice and my friend got the daily pasta. I was contemplating whether to get any toppings or sauce but decided to go original since I've never had an omurice. The portion came out alright. Not so big that I felt FULL but I was satisfied. It felt like comfort food. The omelette was indeed very fluffy. The rice was shorter and fatter than Chinese rice. It was slightly chewy too. There were slight bits of onion and bacon throughout the rice with tomato (sauce? flavor?). The fact that the ingredients weren't in every bite made it exciting when you do get it. There was ketchup all over the whole dish and omelette. I used to think that's way too much but I realized it's just right. It's not just ketchup. They probably made it from tomato sauce or added to regular ketchup. There was extra flavor but not overpowering. I wanted some with every bite. Friend got the daily pasta. Forgot what's in it but some bits of seafood. She felt it was kind of small, not as filling as omurice. There's only two waitresses and I seem to see only one chef. Maybe there's another inside that I don't see. I noticed that they like to serve dishes from your party all at once.  Due to small kitchen, that made some dishes colder. It's not cold but lukewarm. I don't mind. It took like 30 min to have our food. If you guys get hot coffee, they use the pretty cups against the wall. Haha if I knew I'd probably request for a specific one. There's a lot of small accessories against the wall which are interesting to look at. I think they're match boxes on the top of the shelves!Some yelpers complain about their service. Yeah we didn't get water until 15-20min after we ordered. I didn't even think we'd get water. The two waitresses were loud, chatting and shouting across the small restaurant. I mean, it's not like the customers weren't loud so it's fine. Also the lady always said "thank you for waiting" after providing each service. BTWI noticed that the precalculated tip amount on the receipt is calculated after tax. Do the math yourself! Four stars because I like it but not WOW AMAZING.
Chun L.}Broome County, NY}59}14}12}-1}5}5/20/2017}Very interesting restaurant. They have the best selections of coffee. The omurice is good. The only downside is the restaurant is a bit small, can't fit a big party. Overall it's a great place :)
K O.}Irvine, CA}8}61}26}-1}5}5/14/2017}This place rocked!! The space is very limited so I hope you can find the least crowded time. If you are a coffee lover it is worth waiting though...Food is awesome, drink is amazing, and people are very friendly and professional!!
Lucy D.}New York, NY}191}18}0}-1}5}5/13/2017}The hot cakes are absolute perfection: puffy, crispy on the sides, light, buttery. They take some time to come out but they are heavenly. The coffee is delicious! You can choose the bean you want and the kind of processing (some find this confusing). There are a couple things you can ask to be made vegetarian as well, if for some reason you don't want the hotcakes. It's cozy and just enough fancy inside to feel really special.
Nida V.}New York, NY}40}89}27}18}5}5/3/2017}What a truly Japanese experience. Lovely little place where one can tell that no detail is overlooked, from the food to the utensils and decor, everything was on point. I mean, it's tiny, there's bar seating for about 8 people or so, but they've made the most of the space and the experience.My husband and I went with our infant son, stroller and all, and got a little nervous seeing the space. They were sweet and accommodating, they asked some just-seated customers to move toward the back of the restaurant so we could have space to put his car seat down by us and then took the stroller outside to store in the cellar which they retrieved after we were done. We were also lucky to get there just before a bunch of people started lining up outside. No reservations people, first come first serve.I ordered the omurice without the pork, and a cold brewed coffee in one of their to-die-for copper cups; seriously, I would drink anything from this cup, and I'm pretty sure everything tastes 10x better in it--FAVE! My husband ordered the hotcakes with banana filling and whipped cream and a coke float. We finished the meal with the chocolate parfait. I wasn't a huge fan of the ketchup and ketchup-flavored rice with the omurice, but the omelet was impossibly fluffy and good. I'll probably order something else next time though. I'm also not a huge fan of red bean in desserts, but the chocolate parfait was still quite unique and good.We loved the meal, the service was great, the coffee was smooooth and we loved admiring the decor and little accents; Japanese restaurant matchboxes lined up above their cupboard, the coffee siphon contraptions, the pretty ceramic and glassware. Sad that we just discovered this place, we will definitely be back!
Phy C.}College Park, MD}0}2}0}-1}1}5/1/2017}The service was bad. We had to wait for at least 20 min to get just a glass of water after asking for it again and again. The women didn't even bother to distribute the forks to the four of us. She simply dumped all of them in front of one of my friends. Maybe she was too busy, but I don't think that is the case. She still had time to have chats with another staff. After we undertipped, she was suddenly not busy at all and rushed outside to ask for more tips... We got into arguments like she did bring us water eventually... Also, the food was just OK... the eggs of omurice was not juicy enough and the whole dish was too dry. The milk tea was tasteless. The sweet dishes were nice though. To sum up, the food was way overpriced and the service was bad.
Katie-Ann F.}New Hyde Park, NY}59}6}20}-1}5}4/30/2017}Came here with my friend who's been dying to have omurice and we came here to try it out.  Honestly speaking, it was the best meal I have ever had.  Not even joking right now.  I ordered the demi glacé omurice and my friend had the cream one (though we ended up switching because we liked each other's lol).  The egg was so incredibly fluffy and soft; I couldn't believe something as soft as this could possibly exist.  The cream sauce is definitely my favorite.  It was not your typical western cream sauce where it's kinda heavy and overly creamy.  It was light, yet still having that creamy and flavorful taste.  You just have try it yourself and see.  The demi glacé sauce was very rich and deep in flavor, and also very delicious.  Added the kinoko mushrooms for the cream omurice and it worked so well.  The egg portion is larger than the amount of rice.  The rice was also very fluffy, surprisingly.  There were bacon bits in it that made the whole dish all the more heavenly.  The only regret I have is not ordering another cream omurice because one was just not enough  (I literally finished it in less than 10 minutes).   We had the baumkuchen cake for dessert.  It was pre-packaged and not homemade, so I was kinda disappointed.  It was rather small and they cut it in half, sandwiched it with whip cream in between and put 3 slices of banana and strawberry on it.  For $6, I expected a bigger portion and not something bought from a store.  I would not recommend getting that.There are only 12 seats available, so I would definitely recommend getting there early.  The wait is rather long depending on how many people, but we had to wait about 25 mins.  The bigger the party, the longer the wait.  Also, if you get there early, you can get the Berkshire pork katsu sandwich in which they only offer 10 a day.  First come first serve!  And reviews of that show it is to be really good, so I'll definitely try that next time.  Prices for omurice were decent for its value ($11 for original and $13 for omurice with sauce and toppings were additional costs).  All in all, I definitely recommend this place.
Liz M.}Walnut, CA}0}14}2}-1}3}4/30/2017}I came with my mom a little after 11 (when it opens) so we didn't have to wait.... however the wait for the food took almost an hour. We ordered tea came quickly, but the omurice took forever... as for the food itself, it is one of the better omurice I've had in the States, but I was super turned off by the hygiene in this place. The lady who serves the food uses THE SAME gloves, to prepare food, collect used dishes, etc. etc....I couldn't believe my eyes. I was really surprised because this would never fly in Japan.Anyway, as someone from out of town, I would say (if you must eat at this place) only go if you are in the area, I would not go out of my way to eat this.. any random omurice restaurant in Japan is better imo... and cleaner. :x
Colin A.}Northport, NY}100}1}0}-1}5}4/24/2017}This place is amazing! The staff is extremely nice, service is impeccable, the decor is beautiful, and the drinks/food are delicious. Their sake bar typically has a short wait (no reservations) and I would consider it an intimate "date spot" (I wouldn't bring a group larger than 3). They do friendly tastings if you're new to sake and offer top shelf drinks without being pretentious.
Cecilia L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}5}0}-1}2}4/22/2017}considering the time I wasted on waiting, the taste and service here is not good. I don't understand why so many people come here.
Wynne L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}4}0}-1}3}4/12/2017}I regretted that I did not read the reviews carefully before I finally decided to go to this place. I was excepting a lot more from this place and I think reviews on Yelp are overrated! I came here because of their Omurice. However, this place was small and overpriced. There were very few seats. If you are going to Hi-Collar with more than three people, you have to be prepare for the wait. The serving was pretty slow and it took almost fifteen minutes for the waitress to bring out food each time. After almost 45 minutes, I finally saw my Omurice. The food was OK. But my dessert was two scoops of ice cream and I was being charged for ten dollars. It was definitely overpriced.
Jessica K.}New York, NY}162}329}1081}18}5}4/10/2017}Cute cafe with delicious food!! With only 12 available seats inside, bar style this cafe doesn't take reservations so it's based on a first come first serve basis. I would recommend coming early if you want lunch since it's only runs 11-4pm (last order), and the wait can get kind of long. Food: We had ordered the original omurice, Katsu sandwich, siphon coffee, and hot cakes. All were really good, and the egg from the omurice was definitely the fluffiest I've ever tasted! It was so good!! Typically I'm not a fan of black coffee because of the bitterness, but the siphon was amazing without any sugar or milk! There was no bitterness to it and was so smooth. Overall, highly recommended! I felt like I stepped right into a cafe in Japan. I'll be coming back for more!
Jenny K.}Vancouver, Canada}115}6}13}-1}2}4/9/2017}Came with a group of 5 and had to wait outside for 1 hour. When it was finally our turn there was only room for 4 and one of us had to wait outside till the spot beside us opened up. The lady came out to ask if we wanna seat 4 first and waited for us to decided. While waiting she just asked "Do you want to eat today?" Really? Why did you think we waited an hour?The omurice was just fluffy egg with ketchup rice, and the katzu sandwich was incredibly small. A coffee for $10 which came after I was almost done my food? This is not worth an hour of wait and the price. Definitely avoid.
Xinrui Z.}New York, NY}37}21}88}-1}4}4/6/2017}I ordered omurice with mushroom and a soy-sauce like dressing, the sandwich, and match drink. All were pretty good.
Annie L.}New York, NY}260}107}15}18}4}4/2/2017}Possibly the smoothest iced coffee I've had so far in the city. There wasn't that typical acidity, and nice chocolate and fruity notes. My only complaint would be that at $4.50, I was expecting a bit more of it than was given.I also ordered the original omurice, which was pretty good and aesthetically pretty...but not particular memorable, taste-wise. Just think slightly flavored rice, topped with egg, drizzled in a BBQ-like sauce. I probably wouldn't order it again, but would perhaps try one of the interesting desserts on the menu. Would definitely come back just for the coffee though. Looks like you can also get the coffee to-go! The hot coffee is done as a pour-over per order, so prepare to wait a bit...but I'm sure you get a better coffee as a result.The service was also great. The Japanese-speaking servers/baristas were both super nice and efficient. There are only about 10-15 seats in the small space. I went around 2pm on a Sunday, and there was about a 10 person line outside. Lucky for me, I was dining solo, so didn't really have to wait!
TJ S.}White Plains, NY}29}57}42}-1}3}3/29/2017}Small place though the wait time wasn't horrible.  The coffee is pricey but well prepared.  Ordered drip but you can choose from aeropress or siphon.  The omurice was okay. Nothing special flavor wise especially since it's doused in ketchup.  The fluffy egg on top was good. Also ordered a katsu sandwich which is hella expensive for what it is.  The egg salad on the side was great with pickle in it.  Helped cut through the greasy katsu.  This place obviously excels on technique but food is pretty boring if you're Asian. Service was also lackluster. Our waitress couldn't figure out our group of fours orders.  The katsu sandwich just sat there getting cold while she racked her brain. There's only 12 ppl in there!  Get it together lol.
Erica L.}Brooklyn, NY}110}214}270}18}4}3/28/2017}Super small place that fits about 10-12 people... it's only a long over the counter bar table. Menu is a bit pricey but I craved for the omurice! So I came around 12ish after class and found 1 empty stool but no room to sit. The waitress asked all customers to move left/right to make some room.... i ordered the omurice with demi-glace sauce... it's $2 more than the omurice with original sauce. When my omurice came, i was surprised it was a bit small in portion because pictures showed it look decent size... i was starving that time so it was small for me... the egg was so fluffy and good! And so was the ketchup rice!
L N.}Washington, DC}1}26}14}-1}5}3/26/2017}* We arrived at 1:30 PM, with 5 people ahead of us in line. We were seated in 10 minutes (note: your party must be complete, otherwise, no seating)* My husband and I placed our individual coffees orders (HANA and AZMERA each prepared using the siphon method), and the following food orders: OMURICE (delicious satisfying and comforting - you get to choose your sauce), HOT CAKES (perfectly fluffy, light, and non-greasy with a side of special butter and quality maple syrup), a fruit bowl (slices of banana, strawberry, orange, and peach made the breakfast feel like we were eating at home with a touch of specialness - who doesn't like sliced fresh fruit?!), KATSU SANDWICH (this while-available item is described as "irresistible Berkshire pork." That it is! Perfectly prepared with a small side of delicious egg salad and pickled peppers - so appropriate). We left satisfied and filled minus that heavy semi-regretful feeling after enjoying brunch.* The staff are fast, efficient and friendly. We were entertained and quite impressed watching them take orders and prepare these. These people are gold!
Mengjia W.}Manhattan, NY}50}13}25}-1}3}3/26/2017}To start with, it's a really small place, single row along the bar and people sitting tightly next to each other, so u can imagine the waiting timeThe food is ok, not worth the waiting for sure. Just because I've been craving for omurice and this seems to be the "Go to place". A bit disappointed, for the dessert too The service is friendly however way over-whelmed They have 2 waitress leading seats,taking order, sending food, take bill and make tea.... we got our bill before our dessert was served, that's how busy the waitress gets
David N.}New York, NY}82}138}46}18}5}3/25/2017}Eggs fluffy in Omurice - a step above runny. Tomato sauce is a very good sweet. More egg than rice. Hot cakes are on point - harder on outside, soft and moist inside. Aeropress Iced Coffee (Hana) had a thick, flavorful taste without sugar. Coffee Zenzai was complex with red bean, coffee, and mint. Staff is friendly. Portions are right for the price.With that said, I wouldn't wait in line for it - no brunch is worth waiting in line for in my opinion.
Yuanhong S.}New York, NY}31}10}22}-1}4}3/24/2017}Cozy place only with few seats,usually have to wait in a line. If you don't like noisy bar and just wanna chill, this is the spot that you'r looking for. Before I went there, I thought they only have premier sake,but it turns out they have nice beer too. I also had the grilled dry stingray fin, it goes perfect with the sake cocktail.
Sarah S.}New York, NY}33}11}3}-1}4}3/21/2017}This is one of my favorite places to eat by myself or with just one other person. As mentioned in other reviews, there is very limited seating. I recommend coming at an off-peak time. Bonus points (or just basic courtesy points) if you (1) come with no more than one other person and (2) don't dally. That means don't spend forever and a day taking a million pictures on your phone, browsing the web, etc. while your food has already been eaten and there is a line of waiting customers. It's discourteous to the waiting patrons and the establishment. Don't. Be. Those. People.With that said, the Katsu Sandwich is one of the must-orders, if you can get it. The balance of textures in the sandwich is on point (soft bread, crunchy panko, and bouncy pork cutlet). The homemade tartar sauce provided pairs well with the tonkatsu sauce that's already added. I personally add a small dollop to every bite.The Omurice is also great. It will certainly satisfy you if you're feeling peckish. The egg is perfectly fluffy--sturdy enough to keeps its shape but also moist enough to add a certain softness to the dish.  The original sauce is a bit sweet for my taste, so opt for the demi-glacé if you're like me (preferring a savory flavor to go with the ketchup-rice). I usually don't order extra toppings, because by itself, it's already too much food. If I had to recommend something, I'd go with the katsu or sausage. With an extra protein, I could take half of my order to-go. They have a honey lemon tea that I like to get that's soothing. The milk tea is also delicious and can be sweetened to taste with the sugar provided. I keep telling myself that I'll try the fruit enzyme sofa but always end up in the mood for tea. I cannot vouch for the coffee, but judging from the amount of people who just come by for coffee to-go, I would presume it's pretty darn great!Finally, let me just say that their hot cake is THE BEST. This is coming from someone who typically hates pancakes, waffles, and related foods (I know, I know, I'm a monster). My main complaint tends to be that the starring food has no flavor, has a usually bad texture (overcooked and rubbery), and tends to be supplemented with a ton of toppings (which I view as covering up a bad product). This. Hot. Cake. It's just so fluffy. And perfectly sweetened all on its own. Add toppings if you want. Add the syrup if you want. But know that the hot cake by itself is heavenly. Everything else is just bonus.TL;DR: Don't be those people who take up a lot of time. Let's maximize the amount of people who can enjoy the space. Food and drink are delicious. Hot cakes.
Michi S.}Honolulu, HI}19}140}328}18}4}3/19/2017}Retro Japanese cafe/restaurant. This place makes me think of the little mom and pop places (hidden gems) back home in Japan. They get very busy and service can be slow, but they are   very friendly. It's mostly because of their limited space (a very long counter, only counter seating). More than anything, amazing comfort food! My favorite Japanese pasta dish is Mentaiko Cream Spaghetti and Omu Rice...and they have it both here! I'm not much of a coffee drinker but enjoyed my cup of Hana coffee here. Definitely will be back for more. I hate to reveal this secret and let others know about this place. But I want to give them credit for the quality of their food and drinks!
Alexis P.}New York, NY}280}173}38}-1}3}3/19/2017}I'm.... sorry. This place is overrated.I can make better omurice at home. What is that?!I must say that the ambiance is right. Small, a bit cramped, a bit intimate, it'd be a great place for a quiet nightcap/late night date.As far as brunch/lunch goes, it was not worth the wait.
Kevin C.}Queens, NY}204}121}1262}18}5}3/10/2017}Came here today for a quick lunch and it was absolutely amazing. First of all I love the design and decor of the restaurant. It's more like a bar really- there's a long golden table with about 10 seats. They seem to be known for their sake and coffee, but I came here for the beautiful looking food.I got the omurice with Demi-glacé sauce, a sausage, and the pork katsu sandwich. The omurice looked absolutely stunning, like the food you see in anime LOL. A perfectly cooked omelette sitting on top of rice drizzeled with sauce. The egg was so creamy on the inside when you cut into it. I was not a crazy fan of the sauce, but that's totally dependent on your tastes. The sausage I added on amazing as well! But at $2 for a tiny sausage I don't think it's quite worth it. the rice was okay as well, but the dish came together really well.The pork katsu sandwich was BOMB. Like I'm pretty sure it's the best pork katsu I've ever had hands down. This place only uses Berkshire pork which is a super premium cut of pork, which explains the price. The pork cutlet was a nice thick piece, but it was perfectly fried! Inside was super moist and tender. The soft bread was a perfect compliment to the crunchy exterior of the pork cutlet. There's a sauce on the side which you add to the sandwich which was so good also. There are a few pickles on the side to cut through the fattiness of the dish. This might be the best sandwich I've ever had actually... the pork was just that good. But at $13 for a tiny sandwich, I can't really say it's worth the price. My lunch came out to over $30 for just these two items.Next time, I'll get the omurice with a different sauce (I saw a lot of people getting the cream sauce, but just ketchup looks cool too). Also I'll add on the pork for $5 since it seems like a reasonable tradeoff considering the sandwich is $13.. overall a really solid place to get tasty and beautiful food, but it is quite pricey.
Nina R.}New York, NY}13}5}0}-1}5}3/10/2017}I love, love, love this place for its siphon coffee, Japanese pancakes, and omurice!  Alas, I am saddened because it seems the international students from NYU love it too...
Will M.}Floral Park, NY}2}19}0}-1}4}3/6/2017}I came here for a terrible date.  Like she was so damn boring.  We connected on nothing.  She started talking to me about her acne medications and I was like, "Whoa.  Just stop.  Let me just focus on this delicious-ass buns and katsu and shit."So yeah, food was good.
Monique N.}Pleasantville, NY}32}24}11}-1}4}3/4/2017}Great intimate (v v small) bar for catching up with an old friend or sharing a drink with your boyfriend! I discovered my love for plum wine here, and it was well worth it.
Hadley H.}New York, NY}98}93}118}18}4}2/25/2017}This bar felt exactly like bars/kissaten cafes that I've visited in Kyoto.  The bartender spoke in Japanese with guests.  Except for a few of the other guests speaking English, I was transported to Japan without the price of a plane ticket. Hi-Collar has intimate bar seating that made me feel a little self conscious while catching up with a friend, because everyone else was drinking alone or having quiet conversation.  This is not a great place for a noisy reunion!  The plum wine was fantastic but a bit overpriced. You're better off trying something from their sake selection.I can't wait to revisit this place again during the day to try their coffee!
Julian G.}Miami, FL}0}3}1}-1}5}2/24/2017}Deliciois omurice and hot cakes!! Traveled from midtown just to try this plate i found on fb.
Tanner L.}Saugerties, NY}13}55}4}-1}5}2/20/2017}The coffee is great, the food is great and the atmosphere is great. What's not to like. The place is small and you will be rubbing elbows with whoever sits to your left and right but that's ok, we're all here for the food. I will definitely come back for more.
Jess J.}Brooklyn, NY}227}112}227}18}5}2/19/2017}I've only been here at night for sake, not the day time desserts. We had a memorable pre-dinner drinks here on Valentine's Day. The space is small and intimate (only one row of seats in front of the bar), likely not great for bigger groups. He gave us a free tasting of sake because we had trouble sifting though the large selection. I really liked the aged sake, which is somewhat of a new trend. I also enjoyed the pickles that helped clear the palate between sips. The Katsuyama Ken, which was smooth and fruity, is great and easy to drink. The kenbishi kuromatsu was lighter than the Ken and also great.The bartender was very knowledgeable. We had a fun chat about changes to the neighborhood, aged sake and how the owner of Hi- Collar also owns other popular restaurants in the area.
Marina X.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}25}0}-1}4}2/18/2017}tried their omurice! it was great! feels like japan. one of their server/owner(?) had a cool hair style
Karen C.}New York, NY}219}59}291}18}5}2/17/2017}Arrived at 11:15 for early lunch/brunch and the tiny space was pretty empty so there was no wait. By the time we left around 12:15, the entire place was filled so I definitely recommend coming before 12!I got the mizudashi cold brew - delicious on its own. Chocolate and caramel notes. It was probably even more delicious because it was served in a metal cup! One of my fave cold brews in the city. To eat, I got the original omurice. Cutest, roundest, and plump lil omelette that's perfectly gooey inside that topped off the addicting tomato/bacon rice. The sauce isn't just ketchup, btw, it's probably mixed with some other things (in case you feel like it's just ketchup rice topped with an omelette topped with more ketchup). This dish was more than enough to fill me up. Every bite was so good. Didn't feel the need to add any additional toppings. My friend got the pour over and our server was very informative on the kinds of beans you can choose from, according to your taste. To eat, she got the hot cakes with added strawberries, served with syrup and yuzu butter. Denser than it looks, the hotcakes were not your average pancakes. Also very yummy! Definitely recommend adding any additional toppings.Love the little intimate space. Doesn't feel squishy at all even when the entire place is full because of the steel countertop and the mirrors against the wall. The cutlery they used for the coffee and food made everything taste better somehow. Service was kind! Will definitely be back. Curious about their dinner fare :)
Madeline P.}Manhattan, NY}377}61}22}-1}5}2/17/2017}Amazing Omurice!! The dish is simple, fluffy, balanced and expensive but worth it. Altho unless you usually cant eat much ya wont be full after. It's more for the experience eating at an authentic japanese place where the waitress and everyone sitting next to you is speaking japanese. I've seen those famous omurice videos from japan where the fluffy and round football shaped egg splits open on the rice and they smother it with the brown sauce. Altho ive never had it and just always watch the video in hopes that someday I will go to Japan and eat that omurice.. for now I'd like to think Hi collar does something similar. The omelette is definitely impeccable quality. If you order the katsu on top for +$5 it comes in three little pieces. But still overall dish is amazing so thats forgiven. They take card
Joseph K.}Manhattan, NY}110}100}229}18}3}2/17/2017}Very cute restaurant with only bar seats. They have an impressive omurice and pan cakes but they aren't the best quality you can get in NYC. The portion of food is relatively small for their price. I liked the interior of the restaurant and the food but I wasn't amazed by them.
Urszula P.}Manhattan, NY}42}142}448}18}5}2/15/2017}I wanted dinner but I found a great sake bar with some good food. They only have two entrees but a great list of appetizers (including sting ray). Their selection of sakes is vast even with by the glass options. I can't believe that after all these years in NYC I never visited this place when I hit others on 10th. I will come back and hopefully with others because it's worth sharing. This place is tiny so groups will need to wait.I sampled two lovely sakes and tried the hot noodle dish. It really hit the spot.
Kirk S.}Washington, DC}214}677}24}18}5}2/6/2017}Absolutely superb in every possible way.Hi-Collar is a Japanese cafe, but that's under-selling it - it's a little slice of the best, most mature, most classy part of Tokyo right in the middle of NYC.  It's extravagant but understated, small but cozy, and delicious but not overwhelming.  Even the bathroom is perfect.The food and drink here are to die for.  Omurice isn't exactly high-end Japanese cuisine, but they did it perfectly here - it literally tastes like it does in the best, homiest places in Japan.  The teas and coffees - made by absolutely beautiful bronze siphon coffee makers - are superb.  Hi-Collar is worth any line and any trip.  Check it out.
Catherine K.}New York, NY}157}86}241}18}3}1/24/2017}Pros- eggs for omurice was reeeeally fluffy and I liked it- this restaurant is really pretty and cozy - the restaurant was clean and the interior design was petitCons- there is not many seats. Only table at the counter is available - the katsu for katsu sandwich was too oily - compared to the portion, every menu is pricey
Kritti S.}Brooklyn, NY}120}59}406}-1}5}1/23/2017}I always had a great and amazing experience here, great Sake and great traditional service. Staffs are very friendly and knowledgeable in Sake and other drinks. Worth your $$$ to try out this place.
Mina C.}Berkeley, CA}34}16}7}-1}5}1/22/2017}OMG amazing! So I will preface by saying it was pretty expensive, but I guess maybe not excessively so by NYC standards (?). But worth it!Anyway, my friend took me here for brunch & coffee. I love coffee but I have pretty low standards... but I could really taste the high quality of the coffee here. I got the Japanese iced coffee & katsu sandwich. As stated in the menu, the iced coffee is super clean and refreshing. The katsu sandwich (only 10 per day!) was simple, delicious, & perfect for brunch - not overly filling or greasy, but enough to keep you satiated. I also got to try the omurice (done well, but also hard to mess up), the siphon coffee hot (missed which beans, but the flavor was well extracted), and the aeropress coffee iced (iridescent beans from counter culture, which I liked so much, I bought).It's cute, small, and narrow. If you don't come right at opening or during the weekends, I can imagine it getting super packed (maybe 10 bar seats?). As it was, there were only 5 or so of us there on a Friday at 11:30 am. There were quite a few people coming in and out just for coffee. Will definitely be back for the coffee & to check out the sake bar it turns into at night!
Wendy H.}Phoenix, AZ}77}117}37}18}5}1/21/2017}Beautifully made food with a perfect balance of flavors. Love this place!! Everything I have had has been so tasty.
James L.}Reston, VA}347}6}0}-1}5}1/21/2017}I think I just found my new favorite bar in NYC. I am a fan of sake so I enjoyed the selection there. We got two sakes from Fukushima and a stingray dish. The bartenders were stylish, the presentation of food was great, the ambiance was classy. 5*s!
Chloe C.}New York, NY}7}41}11}-1}5}1/11/2017}Came at night for sake. Good selection, nice presentation, and you get to choose your own sake glasses. Bar menu is pretty good and reminds me of Japan.
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}5}12/25/2016Updatedreview}Better come here early for the limited katsu sandwich (only 10 available everyday), as well as other you can't miss items: siphon coffee with beans at your selection and the omrice. Siphon coffee is a bit pricy but you will get a coffee with all delicate flavors well presented. The chicken katsu is hearty and delicious! A thin layer of fat wrapping the juicy lean meat under the crunchy bread cuts--well done! The side dishes are good compliments to the sandwich: egg salad as a spread adding richness and creaminess; the pickled veggies refreshing your taste buds! Loved every bite of my lunch. Recommend this place for a hearty Japanese lunch with good coffee. Will come back for other items on the menu!
Ciel C.}State College, PA}168}46}112}-1}5}12/18/2016}My friend took me there because they have good coffee. And they do. I'm a big coffee drinker and they exceeded my expectations. We ordered hot cakes (Japanese pancakes) and Omurice original with sausage. The omurice came with a relatively small portion and the flavor is great. I think they put bacon bits into the rice. The omelette on top is very fluffy. Yum. Hot cakes are okay. They do look fluffy than American pancakes but they taste basically the same.
Tiffany L.}Brooklyn, NY}302}532}429}18}5}12/18/2016}my new favorite spot.super small, bar seating only but LOVE the vibe. japanese matchbooks line the top edge of the bar. their coffee is SUPERB. came here for brunch with my buddy. we shared the fluffy hot cakes and omurice with katsu. YUM! of course, we indulged in the coffee parfait; coffee jelly with chocolate ice cream and red bean. excited to try their katsu sandwich next time!
Timothy H.}New York, NY}3}78}102}18}5}12/17/2016}I finally made it here after reading about Hi-Collar many months ago. I was here for the katsu sando and anything else was an added bonus. They only make 10 of these a day and I was worried I had missed out on all of them. Thankfully I was reassured by one of the people at the counter that there were a few left. The space itself is really delightful, but very very cramped. Only 11 or 12 seats so you might have to wait a little to be seated. The employees speak to each other in Japanese and adds to the feel of a tiny kissaten in Japan. They have all sorts of apparatuses to make coffee in fancy ways but I don't know enough about coffee to pay the extra money for those. The katsu sando was absolutely spectacular, the sauce is bursting with perfectly measured saltiness and umami. The bread they use does not come with crust and it's great, doughy white bread. Highly recommend, only came for lunch but very interested to see what it is like at night when more alcohol is flowing.
Joyce H.}New York, NY}466}546}272}-1}5}12/16/2016}What a gem! We came here for brunch and had the best hot cakes. The omu rice and the katsu sandwich looked amazing too. I had a yuzu cocktail which was perfect, refreshing and tangy. Great date spot, limited seating so you may have to wait.
Jinny P.}New York, NY}776}146}501}18}1}12/13/2016}I had an utterly unpleasant experience this weekend at Hi-Collar. My friend and I arrived at this place much excited to try their brunch and highly praised coffee but we ended up leaving the place in just 5 minutes and irritated because the woman working at the counter on Saturday was rude for no apparent reason. It quickly deflated our excitement for this place. When we got there, there were couple people standing by the door but no line. We didn't see a host or anyone taking down names so we waited for few minutes by the entrance. When we noticed open spots at the bar, we asked one of the waitresses if we could take those spots. She told us no, then demanded that we go wait outside instead, unapologetic it was only 30 degrees outside. When I asked her how long the wait would be, her answer was, "I don't know". I didn't know what to say! lol. She was brusque and impatient during the whole conversation. It was as if she was mad at us.  There was absolutely no need for her to act hostile about these legitimate questions and her attitude was completely uncalled-for. Maybe she was stressed out or maybe it was something else entirely but whatever it was, I think she needs to remember that she works in the hospitality industry. And as much as I wanted to check this place out, I didn't want to stay at a place where the waitress was letting her personal problems out on her customers. It's just bad vibe and creates this very awkward situation. It is unlikely I'll be returning to this place or recommending it to anyone.
Beimeng F.}New York, NY}72}33}1}-1}5}12/11/2016}OMG, this place is all my manga-dream-come-true Ikemen-run sake bar. Speechless. I'll come back as often as I can.
Happy C.}San Francisco, CA}0}17}0}-1}1}11/29/2016}Absolute frauds. If I could give negative stars, I would. Yelp--please create an option for special cases such as this. I am not a very wordy person, so I'm going to cut to the chase and provide the summary of the horrible night I had at Hi-collar. 1. Came to this place with my date, and it was my first time. The reviews were great, so I wanted to give it a try. 2. Two people working the counters that night: a younger girl and an older lady. 3. We sat at the bar and waited for what seemed like FOREVER and neither of them acknowledged us. The older woman looked at me and walked away, and the younger girl was standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF US but refused to look at us. 4. The younger girl proceeded to attempt to seat other people, even though we had been trying to get her attention for literally 20 minutes. 5. We finally got her attention and asked for two coffees. She pretended like she did not understand what we were asking. 6. The worst part was this---the young girl and the older lady then looked at each other and said (in Japanese) "20 minutes before kitchen closes" and then proceeded to chuckle amongst themselves. Little did they know that I AM FLUENT IN JAPANESE AND UNDERSTOOD THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION. They were basically pretending to not be aware of us to avoid any orders to the kitchen. Frauds. And this was on top of the generally unfriendly and terrible service throughout the entire night. This happened on the evening of Sunday, Nov 27th. I will never come back here, and I urge others to do the same.
Anna N.}King, Canada}78}37}28}-1}5}11/28/2016}One word. PANCAKES! They are a must order! So fluffy and delicious. It comes with orange flavored butter which compliments the pancakes so well!. Their coffee is also delicious. Would definitely return to try more items.
Kayoko Y.}Queens, NY}27}6}2}-1}5}11/23/2016}great coffe in daytime!!  In night time,, all staffs are so helpful and friendly, know about all sake they have!! i always have a good time drinking sake here!! you should check this out!!
Diana N.}New York, NY}8}10}15}-1}5}11/23/2016Updatedreview}Returned to Hi-Collar in Nov 2016. Got the same dish(omelette w sausage add-on). This time around there was a little wait, it starts right outside. I didn't realize the group on people outside was waiting, thought maybe they were just finished eating and chatting outside, nope, that was the start of the line. The lady told us, those people where waiting and wasn't able to give us an estimated time. But my boyfriend and I were find, and decided to give it a few mins. The line went fast . My boyfriend got an omelette also, but w the katsu add-on and both were yummy. I remb that the rice wasn't too ketchup-y, which we both liked. We both got coffee also, him a cold brew and me a hot one, but I don't remb which brew I got, but it was an additional +2.50 on top of the $4.00. So be careful of that. Aside from the pricey coffee, which wasn't bad. I would come back here again, just not often cause of the minimum seating(prob about 8ish bar side seats) and price in coffee.But I love their omelette and the adorable experience, each time that I've come.
Ginny L.}Cupertino, CA}194}11}1}-1}5}11/17/2016}Came here with a friend visiting from Boston! It's an adorable little hole in the wall with very few seats, all at a little "bar" set up that basically makes up the whole restaurant. The ambiance here is fantastic! It's very cozy and quaint. There are matchboxes from an immense matchbox collection lining the walls, along with china and other cute decorations. The service here is quick and friendly.My friend and I ordered the Spicy Cod Roe pasta and an omurice with demiglace sauce. Both so good. The pasta had just the right amount of cream, and the flavor and texture of the cod roe worked fantastically with the just slightly al dente pasta. I personally couldn't get enough of the omurice, though. Sweet tomato fried rice with bacon bits, topped with a fluffy, just-barely-cooked-through omelette, and drenched with demiglace sauce. So good. I'm getting cravings again just writing about this. I would definitely go back just for the omurice. And the meal was fairly reasonably priced, IMO. My friend also ordered an iced black coffee, which she said she really enjoyed. Overall, a great experience.
Danielle W.}New York, NY}108}93}107}18}5}11/16/2016}Love the atmosphere of this place! The restaurant is relatively small, with only bar-style seating (one long bar table and stools), but cozy. I've never had to wait too long to get seated. It's so elegantly and intricately decorated. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go for a non-typical brunch. Last time I was here, I opted for the original Omurice and iced Royal Milk Tea. - Omurice: Surprisingly filling! Traditional omelet over rice with light tomato sauce and bacon mixed in. The egg was cooked perfectly - it was moist and fluffy. The rice was also flavorful, without an overpowering amount of tomato. The original sauce on top reminded me a bit of katsu sauce. This dish definitely gives a homey and nostalgic feel. - Royal Milk Tea: I love the fact that it comes unsweetened. They give you simple syrup on the side to add as you please. It's very light and refreshing. As far as milk teas are concerned, it is a bit on the pricier side at $5.80. Though I'm not a big coffee drinker, it was nice watching the staff prepare the drip-style coffee. All of my friends speak highly of their coffee too. Will definitely be back to satisfying my Japanese brunch cravings!
Inga C.}New York, NY}276}134}412}18}5}11/6/2016Updatedreview}This review is for their brunch, which also gets five stars! We were lucky and came on a Sunday during brunch and didn't have any wait. There's only 10 seats in the house and you sit bar-style but there happened to be two open seats when we arrived. The brunch food was amazing:1) Daily pasta: today's was Spicy Cod Roe which was amazing. Creamy, fishy (in a good way) - like a carbonara but instead of bacon/egg it's cod roe. 2) Omurice with demi glace and sausage: Yum!! The omelette on top of the tomato-y rice. I would get the katsu as a topping instead of sausage next time!  Drinks: 1) Iced siphon coffee with San Pedro - these are some Copenhagen prices right here. $9 for siphon coffee + $2 for the San Pedro beans. I don't think I'd pay $11 for cold brew again no matter how good it is..... but damn it was good coffee. 2) Hot royal milk tea - I was expecting Asian style boba but it's more of a darjeeling black tea latte (foamy milk). It comes without sugar and there's a rock sugar bowl to put as much sugar as you want. Perhaps the only thing I wouldn't get again.This place nails it as both a brunch spot AND a bar. Five stars for both.
Dan A.}Baltimore, MD}204}405}114}-1}5}11/5/2016}I came here on a recommendation from a friend.  While I knew during the day it was a coffee shop, I went at night when it gets converted into a sake bar.  And I am so glad I went.  Hi-Collar was a fun and engaging place with a very cool and unique atmosphere.What I liked most about Hi-Collar was it's old-school Japan vibe.  There's no tables... just one long bar and little room for much else.  The decor inside (down to the restrooms) fit so well and the bartenders were friendly and helpful.  I can't put into words just how cool a place this is.I came a little before Halloween and they had a special going on.  Get a sake and snack set and you get to keep the masu (the wooden box/cup).  There were different types of sakes to choose from and the bartender did a great job of recommending one to me based on my preferences.I also decided to try their pasta of the day, which had mushrooms, fish roe, and cream.  Wow.  That was a really good dish.I absolutely loved this place; it's a definite to-go place the next time I'm in NYC.
Jillian Y.}San Francisco, CA}224}31}20}-1}5}10/28/2016}Came here because of a recommendation from a friend to try the Siphon (which is the only thing I had, so the only thing I can really review). The whole method is pretty interesting to watch and definitely why the price for a cup of coffee was like $7 lol. Still, it was something I've never had or seen, and I love coffee so I gave it a try. Once you order the Siphon, you can choose which bean you want. I chose the San Pedro, one of their limited beans. The coffee itself was good, nothing to write home about, but still good. It was a cool thing to get once, but prob would pass getting it again just because of the price. Using the Siphon method also makes the coffee more acidic and milder, two things I'm not really about. But all in all, glad I went. The staff was super nice too. It's a small space and was really busy when we got there, but the two women were friendly and fast. They know how to work well with each other in such a small space.
ChingWa C.}Manhattan, NY}136}157}222}18}5}10/27/2016}Came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend and two of my other friends. It was a sweet little spot, perfect for date night (day)! One of my friends doesn't drink alcohol, so I found this place on Yelp, and based on the pictures they serve tea and cocktails, which was great! I got there and learned that they stop serving tea after 5 or 6pm. We arrived at around 8:45p, and the bar was kinda full. Keep in mind that the bar is really small, probably can has only 15 seats from what I remember. The bartender was very polite. I got a sake mojito and my friend got this non alcoholic I forgot what it's called drink. They don't do virgin cocktail. My sake mojito was amazing!!! I couldn't taste any sake in it and I am not a big fan of sake when drinking by itself. I later got a carafe of sakegria - that, my friend, is stronger than my mojito. I regretted getting the carafe ... but was able to finish the whole thing with a friend! Everything was fantastic! I didn't get drunk after half a carafe of sakegria and a full glass of mojito! The friend who shared the sakegria with me also got a glass of fruit wine, which was also exquisit!
John G.}Union City, CA}125}83}7}-1}5}10/25/2016}Come here. This place has some of the best service I have ever experienced.We came in and didn't see any seats for our group of five to fit. but the bartender helped move everyone around at the bar to accommodate us. Good first impression.We were looking at the menu and we had no idea what to get. Sake is Sake as far as we knew. But I didn't realize Sake has so many different characteristics just like wine. The bartender helped us by explaining those differences and suggested Sake based on our preferred tastes. The Sake we did try was really good. I used to think Sake just had one flavor. But the bartender schooled us, and I'm glad he did! I'm loving it.There was so much attention to detail and the bartenders there exercised a level of hospitality and discipline I Have never experienced before in my life. I've gone to places with great service, but at Hi-Collar they go above and beyond here. There was a great sense of pride in everything they do. I didn't see the bathroom first hand, I wish I did. But those of us that did, said that the bathroom had to be the cleanest bathroom they have ever seen. Not just clean, but so comfortable that you didn't even want to leave. The vibe in this place is really cool, it didn't just feel like another bar in there. Again, attention to detail. I've never been to Japan. I don't know anything about the prohibition era. But it just felt like this is what a Japanese speakeasy run by samurais would look and feel like.I will make this place a necessary stop every time I come to New York.
Flora T.}Philadelphia, PA}6}23}0}-1}5}10/25/2016}Love this place! Coffee during the day and sake for the night. BOTH are great with the right atmosphere.
Anna O.}Washington, DC}0}18}3}-1}4}10/14/2016}Very unique little place that has done an outstanding job of transporting you away from NYC. Everything is beautifully served - one of those perfect insta-worthy spots. I got their siphon coffee, as it was an interesting concept and I was curious to try it out. Overall the environment, decor, and quality of ingredients is there. Only downsides were the wait time for seats to become available, and the higher price point. Overall, definitely recommend it.
Andrew C.}Las Vegas, NV}441}529}1809}18}3}10/8/2016}We were looking for a place to eat for lunch before we flew out of NYC on our last day. My friend had came across this place on Yelp and sounded pretty good. I had looked at their menu online and had long craved some good Omurice, since the place I had in Las Vegas (Cafe de Japon) was long gone. Seeing they had a omurice with demi glace sauce, it reminded me of this YouTube video i saw of this super popular omurice place in Japan with a nice egg that gets cut open and folds out with half cooked eggs running out and topped with a demi glace sauce. After a short walk from the L line, we had arrived at the restaurant. Small and quaint little place with only bar chairs, seating maybe 10-12 people at a time. My friend had went inside to notify the waitress of our party number. She came back out stating the waitress looked at her and continued what she was doing without saying much. So our party of 3 stood outside waiting for like 15-20 minutes for available seating. 2 parties of 1 had entered and seated during our wait but we thought, eh probably easier if you were a stand-alone person at such a small establishment. Later after waiting 20 minutes or so, a party of two had entered after asking us if we were waiting, and got seated. I totally had a WTF face. Promptly entered the restaurant and spoke to the waitress wondering why they were seated while we were waiting for at least 20 minutes without any notice. One thing that kind of ticked myself off previously in the past is at least give the waiting party an option to sit separately, even if they decline, not just assume they do not want. After telling the waitress we were willing to separate, and her acknowledging and asking if it was ok to have the 3rd person wait until there was a seat, i told her yes and she said ok. Over the next few minutes, we saw that couple come back out while seeing people move around inside the restaurant, and two others leaving. I had briefly overheard the same waitress apologizing and stating hope they would come back another time. I am not too sure what happened there. After the few minutes, there was 4 open seats at the close end towards the front door, and we were seated. Despite the previous troubles, we were served water and had our orders placed promptly. Their lunch menu is served between 1100AM and 400PM (last order) with a minimal menu of either omurice, katsu sandwich, tamago sandwich, or hot cakes. Apparently the katsu sandwich has limited servings per day. They also have a small menu of desserts, hot and iced coffees. As stated previously, i wanted the omurice with demi-glace sauce. $2 more expensive than the original omurice but worth the try. Additional toppings include sausage for $2, cheese for $1.5, kinoko (mushroom?) for $2, or katsu for $5. One of my friends got the original with sausage. And the other got the daily pasta, which on that day, was a mentaiko (spicy cod roe) cream pasta? Despite it being a japanese establishment, we were only given forks. Lol? The food had arrived all at the same time. Different presentation even between the omurice. Original had its ketchup drizzled in a wavy design. Demi-glace sauce was poured over the omelette with two small pools, one on each side of the rice. The rice was nice and light with a nice not overpowering tomato sauce. Menu states it had bacon but i couldn't tell. I tried slicing the omelette open with the fork like i had saw in the youtube video. It did split like the video but not as runny as i had hoped (well duh.. what was i supposed to expect LOL) The demi-glace sauce was rich and flavorful. Not too heavy either. aromatic sauce made from espagnole and a stock. I can taste hints of red wine as well. As said, not too powerful and worked well. The sausage, for $2, is not worth it. Lol small tiny sauce, probably the size of my pinky. It had a good firm texture and flavor but for the size, totally not worth. LolMy friend stated she loved her pasta. I tried a few strands of it. Had a hint of the spicy flavor from the mentaiko. Cream sauce was not too heavy as well. I could probably eat a nice serving or two of that easily. XD om nom nomMy friend had saw on the menu the previous night that they had a seasonal fruit parfait which includes fresh fruits, vanilla ice cream, homemade granola topped with whipped cream. The strawberries used were yummy. The vanilla ice cream was very yummy and reminded me of a french vanilla ice cream flavor. The home made granola was very crunch and delicious with the ice cream. Not too sweet itself so matched well. There was a layer of mandarin oranges as well beneath the ice cream which gave it a nice off-set from the sweetness of the ice cream and flavor of the strawberries as well. What was weird was the few slices of banana on the bottom of the cup. Not complaining personally but taking up space much? HEHEOverall, the food was good. Nice to try. Hope they figure out their seating arrangement/order/whatever better.
Joanna M.}Brooklyn, NY}150}26}45}-1}4}10/2/2016}Small intimate place. It's a place where'd you go with a friend to talk over some coffee and quick bites. I went in the morning and it was practically empty. The katsu sandwich was heavenly. Go early to get them because they only serve 10 per day! The daily pasta was pretty good too.For drinks, i could've went without the fruit enzyme. My friend had the cold brew mizudashi iced coffee. It was exactly what the menu stated, a refreshing and non-acidic cup of coffee that didn't compromise the rich flavor. Sadly i forgot to take a picture of the coffe :(
Yiwen Z.}Honolulu, HI}160}224}604}18}4}9/26/2016}small Japanese quick bites~fruit sandwich is light and not overly sweet (just like most Asian sweets )they only have a bar so be there early~ good place to have a quick chat/date, if you run out of topics at least you can stare into the row of match boxes on top of the bar
Jennifer H.}New York, NY}73}9}13}-1}5}9/25/2016}Went the first time for brunch with a friend. We found this place on Yelp. It was great! The place is small however the food is amazing! It's a family owned establishment with very friendly staff. I will definitely be back!
Eric G.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}0}-1}4}9/25/2016}My fam loves this place.  They don't allow dogs inside, so I had to watch my family enjoying their brunch through the window.  They seemed to have a good time, or so it seemed from a distance.
Amanda C.}Brooklyn, NY}336}98}198}-1}4}9/21/2016}Every time I visit Hi-Collar, I feel like I took a trip back to Japan. The experience is super authentic. I was ecstatic when I saw fruit sandwiches on the menu; a popular food trend in Japan. The sandwich was good but it could've been better; the bread was unusually dry. The Japanese are usually very good with bread. Perhaps, they should get their bread from a different bakery... The mentaiko pasta, on the other hand, was AMAZING! For $10, I kind of expected a larger portion but then again, authentic Japanese food don't come in large portions. I would highly recommend this dish for those who have a taste for savory foods. I'm definitely coming back to try their Japanese-style pancakes! They just look so fluffy! P.S. They have a clean Japanese-style toilet! Come in the winter and you'll feel the heated seat!
Cynthia Y.}SoHo, Manhattan, NY}250}121}12}-1}5}9/20/2016}Honestly my favorite bar/brunch place in the entire NYC! It's tucked in the middle of E 10th st with a bunch of other Japanese places, but this is a true gem. Brunch food is amazing, order the fluffy pancakes or omurice!! Their coffee is definitely one of a kind because you pick the style of coffee you want and then also your bean. Love it when you get choices.For their bar menu, their fish cakes are so good I'm literally addicted to it. The monkfish liver is good as well and I always order the yuzu omoi to go with it. If you aren't sure what kind of sake or drink you want, they allow you to taste. Bartenders are also extremely knowledgeable and friendly.I hate that this place is so close to where I live because I come way too often. I just can't get enough of their food and liquor. Not good on my wallet though.
Kurt J.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}9/18/2016}There is no better place to have a great Mizudashi Cold Brew or a cold Japanese beer to name a few. Cozy atmosphere and exceptional customer service. Let the hustle and bustle fade away as you dive into this diamond in the rough.
Bryson L.}San Jose, CA}513}951}232}18}5}9/16/2016}If I lived in NYC I would be coming here so often... Not only is the food fantastic and authentically Japanese, but the atmosphere really transports you to another world...The inside is really calming and relaxing, it really makes you feel like you've gone back into another time.  There's only bar seating here along the counter.  The lunch menu is pretty extensive in terms of drinks.  There are a lot of meal options too, but not quite as many.  For my food, it was an easy choice, the katsu sandwich.  It was made so meticulously by the workers that I was wowed in amazement by their attention to every detail.  It was hot, fresh, and perfectly cooked.  This alongside the egg salad was a really nice lunch.  It also came with some pickled veggies that had a nice kick of spiciness to them.  The drink I had with my meal was also superb.  There were so many choices though I think back to whether I should've just ordered 2 drinks or something!  But I ended up going with their Homemade Ginger Lemon Soda.  It was picture perfect and had a lot of fresh ginger in it.  I really enjoyed it, but make sure you enjoy ginger as it really stands out!  I really wish I could come here again.  This place offers great authentic Japanese food, drinks, and desserts.  Everything is done so well and the atmosphere is outstanding.  I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in NYC!
Annie C.}New York, NY}178}80}35}-1}4}9/8/2016}My friend and I were in a search for a great brunch place and she suggested we check this place out. The walking distant is short from the train station. The door sign is fairly small so u might miss it so look around! As you enter its a small bar type seating the place is very small. So NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS. As we sat down they gave us a menu. I got the ice drop coffee "cold hearted" very citrusy. One of the best cups of coffee I've had. My friend had the regular ice cold brew coffee. We also ordered the hot cakes &I the omelettes. The food was mediocre nothing special. Two cups of coffee two snacks/meal? For $40 including tip not bad for high quality coffee!This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee and catch up with your friend. Great atmosphere great service.
Leslie L.}New York, NY}88}164}308}18}5}9/8/2016}What an experience!Have you walked into a place and felt like you were completely transported to somewhere else? Well I have, and this was the place.Having been to Japan earlier in the year, I left that experience with a feeling of nostalgia, one where everyone is very kind, people cared about their food and the craft of their drink, and one whole shares laughter and cleanliness.Perhaps it's a bit strange to say but I absolutely felt that here!The boy and I came here to meet some of his old friends who recommended this place. The cocktails were incredibly delightful. The summer cocktail - Yuzu Mojito was incredibly refreshing. Think hot summer day and you just want to cool off with something cold and delicious - this is your drink.I also tried the milky ginger beer which definitely packs a punch in the ginger! I'd definitely recommend if you love the taste of ginger (real ginger, spice and all)! The bartender also pulled out a ton of sake to have us all taste. I loved the level of attention here to see what we liked and allowing us to taste to see what we'd want more of.I'd love to return for the cocktails! (I also saw there was food, next time it is!)
Eunice Y.}New York, NY}5}88}95}18}5}9/3/2016}Finally we went here! Cozy + comfortable atmosphere sake bar in east village. We ordered one of sake bottles that was recommended by a bartender. It was a blue bottle (forgot the name but you can see it in my pictures), very refreshing, smooth and not too strong. You get to try 4-5 bottles before you choose one. Service here is so great! They even brought me a complementary birthday cake with a candle. so cute and very nice!!! Oh and you get to choose the shot glass as soon as you order sake. We also tried their mentai spaghetti which was my favorite!!!!! I can eat it every single day. no jokes. It's a must!
J C.}New York, NY}6}117}2}-1}5}8/26/2016}What I would consider a hidden gem, tucked away in the east village. Come here for a quiet lunch, or with a friend or two to share in the experience. Lovely and charming atmosphere with a quaint and humble feel to their service.
Ms. F.}New York, NY}0}91}0}-1}4}8/25/2016}Really classy, charming spot. Tasty Japanese style light fare and desserts and they seem serious about their coffee. Loved the style (not stuffy!) and the Japanese style sundae. Yum. Good service.The only downside: I was looking forward to chillin and enjoying my snacks while the place was almost empty late this afternoon. But it was like I wasn't there - the employees were talking  really loudly! Not what I expected  and I was a little bummed.
Simon R.}Sunnyside, NY}291}67}162}-1}5}8/25/2016}Absolutely love this place!The food here is authentically Japanese and just sitting at the counter makes you feel like you're not in NY anymore - it's like you've been transported to a small shop in Japan especially with the delicious food that they serve.I was never a big coffee drinker but I've become somewhat addicted to GOOD coffee.  They have a great selection of amazing coffee and I can't get enough!We've been coming back here and will continue to. One of the things you can't miss when going here is the bathroom - they have a bidet!  Use it and enjoy!  You're welcome in advance.
Pete T.}Bellmore, NY}5}25}49}-1}4}8/18/2016}Small place but real nice sake selection.  Couple nice beers. Staff is always friendly.
Christine Y.}Manhattan, NY}216}90}251}-1}5}8/16/2016}AMAZING!! This place is now my favorite place in the city. I came here right when it opened at 11 am on a Friday. We were lucky and got seated right away. There are only about 10 seats in total. The interior of the restaurant was bright and cute with an authentic Japanese vibe. I tried the omurice and it was SO GOOD. I instantly fell in love with the ketchup rice and the fluffiness of the egg. I also got the cold brew muzudashi iced coffee. Normally I don't drink black coffee but it was so smooth I didn't need to add any milk or sugar. I also enjoyed their mentaiko pasta (marinated roe) with nori on the top. The portions were on the smaller side though. Basically, this place will be my to-go place for yummy Japanese food. I love it!!
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}8/13/2016}Intimate place for some casual cocktail drinks and/or light food. So sad that they did not offer dessert after 4pm so we would have to satisfy ourselves with some signature house-made cocktails.Really small space inside with at most 12 seats; nevertheless it was surprisingly not that crowded on Saturday night. I do suggest to come and visit earlier to secure a seat.Their pork sandwich was one of the best-sellers - make sure you get a bite and enjoy it! Too bad I was already way too full!
Natalie Z.}Manhattan, NY}1}109}13}-1}3}8/13/2016}It's so Japanese I wanna say, their staff, food, decor, and ever the restroom lol. Bar sitting, narrow but comfy enough for a casual conversation. The food is great and in the light side
Pech T.}New York, NY}0}4}5}-1}5}8/1/2016}Classy and authentic. I highly recommend this bar for those who want to avoid busy/crazy east village neighborhood
Josh L.}Manhattan, NY}11}82}0}-1}4}7/31/2016}Sake bar at night : attentive bartender and delicious appetizers Daytime cafe: good tonkatsu sandwich and ice coffee
Sharon Z.}New York, NY}484}114}158}-1}4}7/22/2016}Cafe by day and bar by night, I have yet had the chance to visit during the day but the bartenders made the tiny space feel like home. Although they didn't speak perfect English, they were hilarious and cracked jokes with us the whole time we were there. They were really young as well but still quite knowledgeable about the sake selection. I would recommend doing a flight and just letting them know your preferences for either dry/sweet/aromatic/smooth sake. The atmosphere was so chill that I'm dying to go back!
Alexandra S.}Boston, MA}34}17}7}-1}5}7/21/2016}I stopped in by change with my sister and instantly fell in love. The inside looks like you're in a train car. We came in the afternoon, so she got a green tea that she loved and I got a hot Royal Milk Tea, which was amazing. Also the guy working there at the time had this amazing hairstyle- his whole outfit was so cool. He looked like the movie Grease and New York fashion week had a baby. I can only aspire to reach his level of coolness.Also apparently the place becomes a sake bar in the evening. Just a cool place. I can't recall being in a cooler place.
E S.}Rowland Heights, CA}2}85}7}-1}5}7/16/2016}Love! Turn back the clock decor, excellent Japanese food, what more can you want? We had the omurice, sausage pasta, and katsu sandwich. Bomb bomb and bomb! Next time, we'll try the hot cakes.
Victoria M.}New York, NY}2}88}74}-1}4}7/12/2016}Awesome Japanese deco and service. I tried the milk tea and katsu sandwich, like them both. My friends tried the omurice, Japanese iced coffee and iced tea, they all have positive comments. Will come back and recommend it to more friends. Want to try the sake as well.
Zhiming H.}Flushing, NY}0}2}2}-1}5}7/7/2016}pork sandwich,iced coffee,fruit ice cream,that's I ordered ,all of them are awesome! If you wanna go, I recommend them for your brunch!
Mich S.}Manhattan, NY}2}46}2}-1}4}7/7/2016}The food was absolutely amazing!!! They are Japanese size portion so be aware, not your standard American version hahaha...but it was perfect for me because I can enjoy desert without any guilty feeling!
Adam F.}Manhattan, NY}34}96}10}-1}4}7/5/2016}Aside from being really cute and well-decorated, this place serves fantastic coffee brewed using your choice of fancy, scientific apparatus. Their Mizudashi cold brew is also smooth and delicious. The Katsu sandwich and pretty much everything else are very very good and presented with care and attention to detail. For a fun experience, use the restroom while you visit (trust me on this one). The baristas are also really nice and know what they're doing.
Jing F.}Queens, NY}61}14}1}-1}5}7/2/2016}Interesting spot! Matcha beer and Okinawa Umei are great taste!!!!Also Omurice!!!
Vivienne S.}New York, NY}43}7}9}-1}5}6/19/2016}The omurice was super fluffy, I got the original ketchup which also added onto the taste and freshness of the mushrooms. Mizudashi coffee has a great, refreshing, and the aftertaste is not harsh at all. The Ohagi is a must try if you like salty desserts.
Angela L.}New York, NY}16}28}51}-1}4}6/18/2016}Food: Omu rice is Sooo good the egg was perfectly cookedInterior: Love it's detail and character Cleanliness: A+Service: good and smooth Price: worth it
Jennifer H.}New York, NY}12}147}331}-1}4}6/17/2016}I've been waiting to come here for a really long time so I had extremely high expectations for this place. I wanted to try the omurice with ketchup since every picture of it on Yelp looked amazing. It definitely didn't disappoint - good amount of food and tasted great! I plan to return when the craving comes back. Keep in mind that the place is extremely small - the shop only consists of a bar with seating for less than ten people so you have to time when you go very carefully.
Christopher C.}Hong Kong}69}106}446}-1}4}6/12/2016}As you walk in you'll notice a narrow bar/walkway for seating, and that's it. You sit at a high top bar with your companion(s) next to you and the servers across from you.  The kitchen is at the other end of the bar.  There are only about 16 seats along the bar so be prepared to wait if you come during lunch/dinner hours. Atmosphere is chill and staff is friendly. They prepare the beverages and put the finishing touches of dishes in front of you, so you're bound to see some minor unhygienic behavior (eg. No gloves when putting together my tonkatsu sandwich).Tonkatsu sandwich - this takes about 10 mins to prepare.  It is literally a piece of fried pork cutlet and tonkatsu sauce between two pieces of bread with the crust taken out.  They will provide a side of potato salad as well. Overall I give this a 4/5. Hot cakes - they will warn you that this takes a long time to make (15 mins), as it appears they are baking it fresh.  You can ask to add fruit in, they'll bake it into the pancake, which was pretty cool. I'd give this a 4/5 as well.
Elaine W.}New York, NY}299}264}26}-1}5}6/12/2016}This is one of my favorite places in the city, and I haven't even had their sake yet. Uh, that says a lot.A coffee/brunch place by day and a sake bar by night, Hi-Collar is your quintessential Japanese bar with a jazzy vibe. It's a longish restaurant with only bar seats, so if you are with other people, you gotta get there early or wait for seats to open up. The seating is snug, so be prepared to literally rub elbows with the person next to you.I'll tell you that the Japanese drip coffee here is stellar with 99% confidence because every smug coffee expert in my life has said so, though I'm not a drinker myself. However, I will tell you *not* to get the milk tea. For $6.50, it was not the drink of the century I had hoped for and not even one of the better milk teas I've had. What gets me going about this place is their spicy cod roe pasta. It's fricken delicious. If you love spicy cod roe (mentaiko) pasta, you need to get this asap. They make it with mushrooms, and it's more creamy than other varieties I've seen. The berkshire pork sandwiches look amazing, though I've yet to try it. Skip the pancakes--they're good, but not as fluffy as Japanese hot cakes should be.Prices are not cheap, but justified by the quality and service. Also, they use monopoly pieces to hold the check in place (that has nothing to do with the price, but just sayin'). If memory doesn't fail me, they have a bidet in the restroom. Watch out for the step up.
Andrew C.}Toronto, Canada}55}284}478}18}5}6/8/2016}Hi Collar is a really charming Japanese Cafe with really good coffee. It's fairly small with bar style seating only so it'll be a bit difficult to seat a large group (3-4 people would be the maximum I would recommend). The decor is fairly old time-y but cozy. The bathroom deserves a thumbs up for being clean and having a Toto Washlet. For food and drinks, I had a siphon coffee which was delicious. It's a bit lighter than coffee brewed by other methods but the flavours are pronounced. It's also cool watching the boiling process. I also tried the iced coffee Mizudashi which was great - it was neither bitter nor acidic. For dessert we had the Baumkuchen and the Hot Cake / Japanese pancake. The former was nice slice of sponge-like cake with a smooth whipped cream layer. The pancake was thick with a nice crispy outer layer. The whipped butter with orange zest was a nice touch. Overall this was a really nice place to unwind and relax. I saw some others order the Katsu sandwich which looked delicious.
Jeanie C.}Chicago, IL}42}215}3}-1}5}6/6/2016}A favorite in the east village. One long bar to sit at, and the ambiance is wonderful. It'll transfer you to a different time and place. I've been here for fluffy pancakes for breakfast, tonkatsu sandwich for an afternoon bite, and drinks late at night. High quality with great service. Fancy poured and siphon coffee. A gem in the EV!
Stephanie L.}Brooklyn, NY}13}5}28}-1}5}6/3/2016}Hi-Collar is my secret getaway place! If you are looking for a small romantic hidden spot and wanting some light food and desserts, this is IT!
P A.}Toronto, Canada}14}77}83}-1}4}5/23/2016}Tiny, cute cafe specializing in yoshoku - western influenced Japanese food. It has the look of a nostalgic, antique bar and has a pretty calm, relaxing ambience. Came in for a weekday lunch and was able to get a spot easily. The Omurice (original) was perfectly presented and as fluffy as the menu promised. It may not look significant but it's definitely a good portion. Would recommend their Ice Coffee as well!
Bee W.}Manhattan, NY}1}44}3}-1}5}5/21/2016}Really great atmosphere and coffee.I had the Mamuto AA Siphon, which is definitely worth trying if you are a coffee lover!
Christina S.}Santa Ana, CA}70}18}1}-1}5}5/6/2016}I've been to Hi-Collar multiple times just for the cold brew. It's one of my favorites out of the numerous coffee shops I've popped into (Cups app user ;)). You won't regret it!
Tabe A.}Jamaica, NY}1}12}18}-1}5}5/5/2016}I love Tokyo blend coffer. It is exactly kitssa ten in NY. Also, nice design especially sink in Bath room. Love it.
J W.}Elmhurst, NY}2}28}76}-1}5}5/1/2016}I came here for three times already! Love this little place.Although you might need to wait for the seats. The ambiance is great! People work there are nice.I have tried tea, sake and omurice. They are all ok. Nothing too fancy. Not really into alcohol, but they do have a nice selection of sake. Can't wait to go back and tried the sandwich, pancake and parfait!
George C.}New York, NY}0}7757}14306}-1}4}4/28/2016}The katsu sandwich was far better than the $3 matcha rice krispie, so can't throw 5 stars at 'em.
L T.}New York, NY}1}63}32}-1}5}4/26/2016}Best iced coffee. Nice little cafe style coffee house that offers a few Japanese breakfast items. It has a quiet ambiance. I had the omu rice and pork cutlet sandwich. A very quint place for a weekend morning coffee and books.
Mark C.}Brooklyn, NY}318}272}1550}-1}5}4/25/2016}Did brunch Sunday I got the steamed milk coffee you can get it either iced or steamed and I got it hot and it was very very good!They have many options for coffee it's pretty cool and the desert menu so good just look at the pictures I wish I would have got dessert!The Omurice with sausage is an omelette over rice with tomato sauce and the eggs were perfect!I love places like this that have something unique going on if your with two or three people just be prepared to wait a little bit until people leave it's busy crowded!
Ria Lalaine R.}Briarwood, Queens, NY}23}39}12}-1}5}4/21/2016}Went here on a sunny Sunday afternoon with my sister and nephew. Had to wait for about 20mins outside. The place is really small, can probably seat around 10-12 people. It's like a cocktail bar converted to a coffee bar. We ordered Omurice with Katsu in cream sauce, japanese hot cakes, royal tea and coffee. The Omurice was really good- rice was flavorful, the egg was cooked perfectly, the katsu was really good but it's too small for my liking. :| The hot cakes were TDF. Served hot and fluffy. The special buttercream was really the highlight of this order. The creamy texture of the butter, the orange flavoring, it's already sweet so you won't need to put a lot of syrup. I had to ask for an extra serving of the butter. :) The royal tea was good, refreshing and just perfect to pair up with the japanese hot cakes. You can adjust the level of sweetness to your liking since you'll be the one to put the sugar syrup in it. It tasted like jasmine tea with milk foam. Coffee was good, too. No fuss. Just simply coffee. It was kinda pricey. $60 for the 4 food items including taxes and tips.
Mendy Y.}Austin, TX}508}527}420}18}4}4/16/2016}This is one of the cutest coffee/dessert bars that I've ever been to in the city. The space is very small: it's just a medium-length of table with bar stools that can seat about 10 people. The baristas are very friendly and accommodating. During the day they have lunch items, dessert and coffee. At night they have drinks. I tried the fruit enzyme (pomegranate with some sort of soda). I thought it was refreshing but definitely really pricey (around $6) for how small it was. Because I really liked the vibe and the staff, I'm tempted to come back and try the food as well as the sake bar at night.
Iole Marie R.}Carroll Gardens, NY}75}33}4}-1}5}4/12/2016}Omurice was soooo good oh my goodness. My two friends and I loved this place. The place is small, personal style eating setting, with a bar that can seat about 12-ish people, I liked that a lot. The counter and behind the counter is very beautiful too, you get to see the people make coffee/prepare things. I also had the milk tea warm, very yummy and big too. My 2 friends and I got the chocolate ice cream thing in a cup, and I am so sad I did not take a picture, but the cutest and considerate thing that they did was that they gave us 3 chocolate chips on top instead of one. That added care and attention, because they knew we were sharing was really sweet of them. Overall, will eat her again for sure and hopefully multiple times as well. Friendly staff and there is this guy with awesome hair, owner maybe? Idk but either way, dude has some badass hair and he said goodbye to us when leaving. (I will am now Omurice dreaming yummm)
Annabelle M.}Manhattan, NY}26}143}119}-1}5}4/10/2016}I crave Hi-Collar's pork katsu sandwich and omurice quite frequently, but I don't go as often as I'd like because I know I'll have to endure a queue. Today luckily I showed up by myself and the group of three in front of me decided to go elsewhere, so I was seated after just 10 minutes of waiting. I sat at the very back of the counter and ordered a Japanese green tea and the long-awaited pork katsu sandwich. I could see everything being made in action. They work really fast and hard behind the counter. It can feel a bit crammed inside but that's part of the charm of this place. I love the atmosphere and the choice of coffees and teas on the menu.
Jae L.}JAMAICA, NY}2}19}27}-1}4}4/10/2016}Cute Japanese cafe, came for the coffee. More like a sit in coffee spot. Kinda pricey but nice selection of beans and brew methods. Worth the visit
Jaci N.}New Haven, CT}5}36}5}-1}5}4/2/2016}Pricey but totally worth it. Really nice bar tenders. Beautiful cozy environment. We went on a Friday night and it wasn't so crowded even there are only ten seats. I really want to go back for lunch one day!
Vicky F.}Tampa Bay, FL}136}455}284}18}4}4/1/2016}Heard so much of this place so we finally decided to try it out. Around 1:30 for lunch the shop was basically empty which was fantastic. Because they only have about 10 seats by the bar (and that's it). Gotta try the coffee because that's what they were famous for- everything is super cute but i might have chosen the wrong bean (and btw most of the beans need extra $1/1.5 on top of the coffee which is $4-6). The food was amazing, there aren't that many options. My friend had the omerice and I had the daily pasta. They were tasty! But the portion is a bit small for me  i wasn't full after so I guess you were supposed to get dessert as well?!The check came out $20+ per person which wasn't so bad but would need to spend more on snacks/dessert afterwards...
Jenny S.}Pasadena, CA}2064}2481}6739}18}4}3/27/2016}Went to the cafe during lunch and it wasn't crowded for Friday afternoon. 4 stars for the experience and 3.5 for the foodBar seating only and if you sit on the inside end they make all food in front of youThey serve Japanese Food that's simple but still good, Although the price isn't really worth it --pork katsu sandwich (10 servings per day): made with white sandwich bread & served with a tartar sauce...good--hot cakes: yummy little fresh cakes! Although pretty plain Jane, I liked the special orange butter served with them --seasonal fruit parfait: it was so warm in the cafe that the ice cream melted instantly! Def not worth the priceThe Bar is cute maybe it'd be better if we came for drinks
Polly A.}New York, NY}37}246}310}-1}5}3/23/2016}Love their coffee (barista's choice is always yummy) during the day and love love love their sake selections (and I get to choose my sake glass) and any food item off the menu.  It's just a wonderful spot to hang out any moment of the day
Regard T.}Fremont, CA}11}32}43}-1}3}3/20/2016}Over priced and pretty disappointed!! I was looking at coffee menu once we sat down. Their coffee menu is very confusing. It has three different prices based on the brewing methods. I was going to get pour over for $4.5, then I have to pick the beans and every single kind of beans is $1.5-$2.5 extra. So the regular coffee is between $6-$7 not $4.5. I didn't get it at the end because I feel like it's a trap.Their omurice (omelette over rice) is $10-$11 depend on the sauce. My bf and I both added tonkatsu pork for $4 extra. It came with three small tiny pieces. $14-$15 for a dish isn't bad if the pork is bigger. We paid $36 for two dishes including tax and tips. Both of us weren't feeling satisfy when we were done. Would not recommended. =(
Amy L.}Brooklyn, NY}31}177}232}18}4}3/19/2016}Came here on a Friday a little before the afternoon shift was over. I had eaten a full lunch beforehand, but stopped by to hang out with some friends. Although there are only a few seats at the bar in this place, the interior feels very traditional. Paintings hang along the walls and the atmosphere is welcoming. There was no wait, however, and the servers were amiable. I shared an Omurice (no pork) with my boyfriend, and our friend ordered an Omurice with sausage. I was surprised at how filling yet not too heavy the rice was, for I have had omelette rice before at Chinese restaurants and they are always too much for a light meal. You can choose among different sauces on top of the omelette, but we stuck with the original. I would definitely come back on an empty stomach next time to fully enjoy the dish! It seems very worth it for a ~$10-$13 plate that is guaranteed to fill your stomach (and cravings :) ).We ordered dessert the same time that we ordered our rice dishes, but the server waited until we were done to start making the Chocolate Parfait. I liked that they prepare it right in front of you, although the ingredients were not as special/fancy as I thought they would be based on the menu description. The Chocolate Parfait comes with nuts, chocolate ice cream, and some coffee jelly cubes. I didn't particularly love the mix of the bitterness from the jelly cubes (not a coffee person) at the bottom of the parfait, but it did add a good twist to the very sweet top of the dessert. Our check was only ~ $40, which was definitely worth the food & service. Excited to come back!
Kevin C.}Longmont, CO}74}188}12}18}5}3/16/2016}Such an awesome little coffee shop, this place was excellent when we stayed in NYC and we hope to come back another time!
Helen P.}San Francisco, CA}84}184}766}18}4}2/22/2016}Classy/cool coffee spot that turns into a bar at night. We were lucky to beat the crowd here on Sunday morning because there are only a dozen or so seats in Hi-Collar. I LOVE the hot cakes. They're so fluffy and delicious, I could eat them for breakfast every day. $8.50 is pretty pricey for two small hotcakes, and that's not including the $1.50 you have to pay if you want fruit added. However, they're delicious and I think I can justify occasionally forking over $10 for those fluffy disks of goodness. I really enjoyed the aeropress coffee I ordered. The coffee was served in a fancy copper mug that kept the coffee nice and chilled the entire time. I don't remember the name of the coffee bean, but the flavors were described as light and fruity with hints of pineapple.The baristas were super chill and friendly. They don't try to make small talk with you but will answer any questions you have about what to order.
Renee L.}Los Angeles, CA}166}62}135}-1}3}2/22/2016}Food was aiite. Service was... cold? She was very warm and friendly to the people she was familiar with and the Japanese-speaking folks. She was indifferent/borderline cold with me. I wouldn't normally care but this place is such tight quarters it makes for an awkward dining experience when she's within 2 feet of you the entire time. I had to wait patiently for about 10 minutes while watching her pace back and forth to place my order. This stinky b.o. dude sat down next to me and ruined my palette. Cool bathroom though. Oh yeah-I spent over 20 bucks and I'm still hungry so I'm writing this at T-Kettle to fill my stomach summore. Lol! And they charge $1 for extra pickles. (First side came with 3 pieces. Like... tiny pieces. Just sayin.) I'm being generous with 3 stars for the experience. Never coming back.
AY L.}Manhattan, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}2/17/2016}Love this place!It's tiny and has only counter seats, but the decor makes you feel like in a kissaten ( Japanese-style tearoom/coffee shop) in Japan. We've been here twice, and the food has been amazing so far.Food:1. katsu sandwich -- look at the thickness of that pork chop! That's called a real pork katsu! Very juicy and tender.2. original omurice -- Japanese-style omelet over rice. The omelet on top was super fluffy, and the ketchup fried rice underneath it wasn't fancy but surely makes you feel like home.3. hot cakes -- Japanese-style pancakes. They made the pancakes right behind the counter in front of us and it smelled so nice. Drink:1.  mizudashi iced coffee - the cold brew coffee doesn't have a strong taste yet it's pretty decent. It was smooth and perfectly matched with the cakes.2. matcha au lait -- high quality green tea. We enjoyed the aroma a lot.They change the place into a sake bar after 5pm. We've only checked the sake menu, great collection. Will definitely want to give it a try.Very looking forward to our next visit!
Angela K.}Manhattan, NY}355}338}110}18}4}2/15/2016}Love the coffee here. The employees are very friendly and helpful when picking out beans to purchase. My favorite is the mizudashi iced coffee (although I've also had their Tokyo blend aeropress, and enjoyed that also).I haven't tried many of their desserts, but I didn't really love the one that I did try - the green tea Rice Krispie treat. The vanilla ice cream that came with it was delicious, but the Rice Krispie itself tasted stale. My friend said that she saw them in the back take it out of a package. Would recommend passing on this one.5 stars for the coffee, 3 stars for the dessert (may change depending on what I try in the future).
Lusvita N.}New York, NY}9}40}34}-1}5}2/10/2016}A very charming Japanese coffee shop offering a variety of coffee, food and pastries. We tried the Tokyo blend iced coffee which was done right, refreshing and with depth. We were full so didn't try the food, but some girls next to us had katsu sandwich whose katsu was freshly delivered from the curry establishment (curry ya) and another girl the cafe's famous omurice- looking fluffy and tasty. We got the delicious chocolate hot cakes, not too sweet and quite light. Highly recommended!
Cathy L.}Manhattan, NY}54}42}1}-1}5}2/6/2016}One of my favorite places to get brunch! Love the atmosphere and the food. The ladies behind the counter are always so lively and fun! Sometimes this place can get a little cramped but for the food it's worth it. At times the omelette on the omurice can either be a hit or a miss. When it's good, it's really moist and runny good that falls and draped over the rice when split with a knife. When it's not, it's like a huge spongy block of egg. I'm not sure why there's this inconsistency but either way it's still good.
David C.}New York, NY}45}142}62}-1}4}2/5/2016}Good spot, very small, only bar seating, isn't too loud but doesn't get too quiet most of the time.Drinks- Roman - Taru Sake & Sherry Wine w/ Cinnamon Stick - Not a very strong drink but the aroma is good.  - Denshin Rin - Easy to drink, stronger than the Roman, slight fruitier taste.  Pretty expensive at $19 a glass, good but would try something else next timeFoodPasta Dinner - I didnt enjoy this much as it had a creamy taste to it that I dont overly enjoy.  Chazuka - Raw Tuna with Soup Rice, sprinkled with seaweed.  I enjoyed this dish, good aroma, good taste, bit salty in a good way.  Would def get again.Overall a very good experience, very small place, so it might get crowded.
Kelly K.}Manhattan, NY}3}34}117}-1}4}2/3/2016}another cozy place in L.E.S. (a little tight on the walking / waiting room if it's a full-house) with a calm and quiet atmosphere and lovely decor and interior (check out their bathroom!). Both coffee and food are great here. The Tokyo Blend Pour Over as well as the Hot Cakes with gelato on the side were so delicious. My friend who came with me also enjoyed the Cold Brew Mizudashi Iced Coffee, Pork Katsu Sandwich and the Chocolate Parfait.
Mandy Z.}Flushing, NY}61}149}233}-1}5}1/31/2016}Beautiful interior, small and cozy, their Japanese cold drip coffee is pretty good. I also loved their hot cakes, very fluffy, but can be a bit heavy, however it's probably the best morning combo with Japanese coffee!
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}3}1/21/2016}4 stars for the menu, 3 stars for dining comfort.This cafe is literally one counter long and four - five feet wide. The counter is large and will fit about 10 people across (comfortably), but it is definitely not a great place to meet a date or have lunch with a friend. Partially because you won't be able to sit facing your companion, but mostly because there is not enough space to have a 'private' conversation. I appreciate that they offer coat hooks behind the counter and bag hooks under the counter, which helps to maximize space and minimize clutter, but it only helps so much. I'd read up on the menu before coming in, and originally I'd wanted to try the Katsu sandwich. However, it seemed like most Yelpers recommended the Omurice, so I went with the Original Omurice instead - adding on katsu as an additional topping.The first thought that went through my head when I got my omurice was...I paid $4 for THAT much katsu?!?! (Literally, like 3 baby strips of katsu..!!) I would not recommend getting the katsu because it definitely wasn't worth the additional cost, and I actually found the katsu quite dry. Otherwise, I found the Omurice to be extremely filling, and the perfect comfort food to warm up my belly on a cold winter day. The original sauce is a mixture of katsu sauce and ketchup, which was actually really delicious and creative!Given the small space, they most likely don't have a full kitchen in the back. I think a lot of their food is prepared elsewhere (next door?) beforehand and then heated up and served. I could hear what I thought was the beeping of a microwave coming from the back, and someone delivered a covered plate of katsu midway through my visit. As for the egg topping of the Omurice, I'm assuming they probably have a portable stove top in the back that they cook this on, which is impressive considering how perfectly runny the omelette was. All in all, definitely a pricey place to have coffee or lunch. My lunch rang up to $15 and change not including tip. I might be back if someone else suggested it (and was willing to pay for my meal), but I think one visit is enough to satisfy my curiosity for this place.
Laurent B.}Brooklyn, NY}38}30}6}-1}5}1/9/2016}Beautiful decoration from the floor to the ceilingGreat serviceUnique coffees and drinks. Loved everything
Lexi S.}New York, NY}13}16}1}-1}4}1/7/2016}Good, quiet sake bar. Interesting appetizers! I hope to go back soon for lunch.
Desmond F.}New York, NY}57}91}54}-1}5}1/4/2016}The omurice here is to die for. Everything else they have is really good, but I come here for the omurice with the demi-glace sauce.The coffee selection is really cool as well, I recommend ordering the siphon coffee or at least asking a friend to do it so that you can watch them make it (it's fun). I haven't developed my coffee taste buds enough to tell if it tastes different though.
Cindy W.}Brooklyn, NY}85}19}6}-1}4}1/3/2016}Hi Collar is a little gem. It reminds me of food from Japan and is pretty authentic and fresh. It's small and cozy perfect for a date night. Everything on their menu is pretty good. You can't go wrong with asking the bartender for recommendations. They have a wide selection of sakes. Yuzu sake is always a good choice. It's different since it's only has bar seats so if you're looking for a sit down restaurant style, go elsewhere. Def would go back.
Moranda B.}New York, NY}20}161}63}-1}5}12/29/2015}My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Tuesday around 2pm. It's a small cute small, very narrow, no tables, just a bar. But I of course knew that after seeing on yelp. The decor, plates, cups, and utensils here are all quite beautiful. The bathroom is super cool too! There are stones in the sink and the walls are gold tiled. Its really quite an aesthetically beautiful place. It really brings one out of NYC for a minute.The staff is very efficient and precise. They are kind and seem to be enjoying their jobs which is nice. We ordered two siphon coffees (the prep just looked so awesome) The coffees were delicious. We both got the dark tokyo blend. For food we ordered a fruit bowl, katsu sandwich, and the hot cakes with fresh fruit (which were bananas).The bowl had clementines, peaches (which I believe were canned), fresh strawberries, and fresh bananas. It was standard.The hot cakes were so delicious. They were very similar to pancakes just thicker. Love how they trim the edges. Batter was not too sweet. The give a side of maple syrup which is wonderful and this orange rind butter which is seriously divine. These were amazing! Seriously. The katsu sandwich was so delicious. The sauce on the sandwich was perfect with the crispy tender pork. Whatever yellow sauce they put in a spoon on the side was also good and they include a (very small) small side of pickled veggies. Presentation on each dish was lovely (and you can watch them thoughtfully make each plate in front of you). It was enough food for me but I think my boyfriend was still hungry. Maybe next time we will order the omurice. I honestly think the pricing is reasonable. Maybe only the katsu is a dollar or two overpriced. But worth it.Overall, wonderful experience.
Steph Z.}New York, NY}41}108}108}-1}4}12/29/2015}Excellent coffee, made with great care! Great Japanese style cafe food. Small cozy space with beautiful flower arrangement, counter space only. Friendly and fun staff. Beautiful porcelain, pottery, glasses for the food and drinks. A very authentic Japanese Cafe experience!
Alex Z.}New York, NY}0}11}1}-1}1}12/27/2015}I ordered the Japanese pancake then while I'm eating it, there's a piece plastic sharp things (I guess it's a piece of broken plastic box)in the pancake ,, if I swallow it It could be very dangerous. I'm seriously doubt their Safty for the food. I do like their food before but I won't come ever since thisThe experience scares me off.
Robin H.}New York, NY}501}22}32}-1}5}12/21/2015}Amazing lunch/brunch atmosphere. Food isn't expensive. They have omurice, pancakes, pasta and sandwiches. The coffee selection and quality is amazing. You can choose your own beans and brewing method, and everything is done right in front of you. More than anything, I love the whole vibe and aesthetic of the place, very old school Japanese, high class. Teacups were very beautiful. Place gets crowded on weekends so don't come with more than 3 people.
S. M.}Manhattan, NY}1}27}0}-1}4}12/19/2015}Even though this is a coffee shop, I actually like the food here more than the coffee. The omurice is wonderfully creamy, and the katsu sandwich is a great balance of crispy and fluffy. The interior is really cute - it's very vintage Japan. Check out the washroom too.
Jennifer L.}Manhattan, NY}175}358}457}18}4}12/18/2015}I was hoping to grab dessert and dinner, and headed to Hi Collar after seeing pictures of delicious dessert and coffee. Unfortunately, when I arrived, I was presented with only a drinks and snacks menu. But the bartender was kind enough to show me the lunch menu and offered his recommendations. He was super helpful and let my party sample about five to six sakes before deciding on which ones to order. We finally decided on two and wasn't disappointed. There is a nice speakeasy like ambience and great to catch up for drinks or nice for a date. I will definitely be back for lunch!
Nuda T.}San Francisco, CA}0}19}13}-1}5}12/15/2015}Maybe my favorite sake bar! It's tiny! But the decoration is awesome. East meet west! Warm and chill feeling. Always take friends here. Drinks is good
K L.}Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA}51}34}0}-1}5}12/9/2015}i LOVE THIS PLACE! Visited on a short trip to NYC, and then went again the next day because it was so legit. The food is just as good if not better than what I had when I lived in Japan. Will definitely visit again whenever I'm in NYC.
CY S.}Manhattan, NY}25}8}16}-1}2}12/5/2015}Me and my friend wanted to have a drink after dinner last night, so we came this place about 10 pm. We stay only one hour, but the waiter told us to change seats twice...twice in a hour! I know it's a small place, but we moved from middle of the bar, and at the end we were next to the door.... I was not feeling very comfortable...., especially the second time the waiter told us to move, I told him "we actually moved there to here already." He was not answering or any apology but still moved our drinks... I mean I can accept if he told me "sorry for the inconvenience."... Etc. But he just say nothing but still move our drinks...I don't quit understand this.Also, I tried to order food for to go before we leave, I asked to waiter the menu about do they still have pork katsu, the waiter told me they don't have pork katsu anymore, then he recommend the rice soup item, and I told him "I want to order something for to go so maybe not rice soup." He didn't mention anything and answered "oh, yes." So I ordered sausage and fish cake instead. About ten minuets later, another waiter brought us forks and napkin, so I told him "sorry.. I think I ordered for to go..." He answered me with not very friendly tone "we don't take orders for to go."  I said "but I told the other person, I want to order food for to go....." While I was still speaking, he cut my sentence and said "it's ok, I can pack this." Ok, the story end, so the point is, I think there is a little mistake going on, I don't really mind mistakes, it happens every where, but the way he talk to me just not friendly and professional. I really like this place, small cute vintage environment, food is ok, I tried lunch couple times, they were all good, coffee is my favorite! Last night just destroyed the whole my positive feeling of this place, I think the customer service needs some improvement. 2 stars is because I still think coffee is good.
Dawn R.}South Orange, NJ}290}3}0}-1}4}11/29/2015}I loved everything about the lunch/ coffee bar. The iced coffee I had was perfect with the tamago sandwhich and Japanese hotcakes! Will definitely come here whenever I craved those soufflé pancakes.
Veronica Ashley R.}São Paulo, Brazil}44}10}23}-1}5}11/19/2015}IMPECCABLE JEWEL! My late breakfast was a feast of intricate ritual and humbleness.  Katso Sando - my new favourite (I must confess I am finding a new favourite by the hour, here in NYC) sandwich. Pork & some kind of sweet/ sour Japanese barbecue sauce on a perfectly cut rectangular white bread is the base of this simple, yet extremely tasty sandwich.  It comes with a side of pickled onions, celery and red pepper (ew. Not into red peppers, but the celery and onions were perfectly balanced), and also a little dish of mayo with bits and pieces of hard boiled egg.  BALANCED TO THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. Coffee - I had a rich blend (I am not a coffee connoisseur.  I just drink it. A lot. I also know the rituals.  I Simply cannot remember all the blends. :( oops) prepared in a siphon.  LOVEIT!  The taste seems to erupt from the freshly ground beans. The china they serve is stunning. Each one unique.  Check out the pictures to see the ones Gus and I got. Hot Cakes - Japanese style pancakes served with local maple syrup and their speciality butter. Hmmm-mmmm! Orgasmic! Service is very low profile, eloquent and exact. The place is small, just a bar that opens for coffee in the morning and becomes a sake bar at night. Enjoy!!! Don't forget to visit the bathroom while you are there! It's a golden oasis for you to get fixed up before heading out into the streets again.
Weili H.}New York, NY}248}156}134}-1}4}11/18/2015}Hi-Collar is literally a bar, aka with one bar table top featuring about 10 seats right in front of the liquor bar, served by 1-2 bartenders/servers. I've been here once at night after dinner and once for lunch, one of my very close foodie friends told me about their menu (at the time I was very into Japanese lunches), it turned out that they offer a different menu throughout the day. I had several teas here, they were ok, their desserts were also just ok, the green tea cake was alright. My friends tried their iced coffees and found them somewhat unique, like a frappuccino, or a bubble tea kind of drink. They have such good katsu sandwich and omelette rice, especially the katsu, we tried pork (I don't usually eat pork), which was so crispy on the outside but juicy inside, that completely overturned my perspectives of pork katsu. I got the omu-rice with gravy, sooo hot and creamy and tasty. Overally it's a quick lunch spot or at night a nice and quiet sake bar. It's so small that I guess you can't really sit there for too long, because you'd feel pressured to leave if there're guests waiting. The servers are extremely polite and nice though.
Fangda G.}Gowanus, NY}53}6}58}-1}4}11/11/2015}Love this bar!that is so small,just have the line of the seats.but is pretty cool!u can choice what kind of glasses u like to use to drink!
Bert N.}New York, NY}102}253}0}-1}5}11/10/2015}I love this place.  Cozy coffee bar by day and supposed sake bar by night.  I arrived five minutes after opening and it was already bustling.  The Katsu sandwich is good but a little pricey.  Coffee is great and service is on point.  I love the vibe, especially with the jazz playing.  This place will definitely be in my rotation.
Big B.}New York, NY}248}662}16}-1}4}11/9/2015}very tasty, very stylish japanese place. Highly recommend if you like japanese-style cafe. Their omurice is very good.
Daniel T.}Montebello, CA}16}98}2}-1}5}11/9/2015}A solid cold brew can be had at Hi-Collar.  It was strong, rich and bold and flavorful.  So if you want the watered down variety go hit up somewhere else.  The space is very retro and the service was great.
Jennifer C.}Manhattan, NY}196}326}14}-1}5}11/8/2015}A 5-star coffee experience.Yesterday, my boyfriend and I enjoyed brunch here.  We each had different iced coffees (I had a cold brew and he had a Tokyo blend), and they were each fantastic.  We also loved the food - I had the omelette with mushrooms and cheese (it was super fluffy, and served over tomato rice with a ketchup-y sauce), and he had the pancakes (which were absolutely perfect).  The restaurant is essentially an impeccably decorated bar, so not much room here for large groups.Definitely not your typical NYC brunch, but super tasty and very interesting.  I will definitely be back!
Alyssa Y.}New York, NY}69}240}39}18}5}11/6/2015}Gorgeous, classy gem of a space, with delicious coffees, teas, food, and best yet, sake! I love the atmosphere of this place, especially considering that the owner (he owns 10+ Japanese restaurants in the area) has a wide range of establishments, from utterly divey to this impeccably designed, chic spot. My mom, who's from Tokyo and is a tougher critic than me (which is saying a lot), said that as soon as she saw the bathroom, she knew she'd love this place. Plus all the employees are Japanese, so you can't question its authenticity :)
Janus C.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}626}458}9}18}5}11/5/2015}Came here for light lunch and catch up time with a friend at 12:30PM and was the first party here.There is only bar seating (it's a cafe by day, sake bar by night). We ordered a katsu sandwich and a tamago sandwich to share. They're both small and on the pricey side, but they're delicious. The tamago is soft and fluffy and just melts in your mouth, while the katsu is juicy and crispy. (Come early if you want the katsu sandwich - they only have 10 servings a day.)They specialize in coffee, but I wasn't feeling it today. My friend ordered the apricot tea, which was decent and comes in a french press pot. I ordered a matcha banana shake, which was super delicious (albeit expensive), and a hot royal milk tea (overpriced, average).The decor in here is minimal, but it just feels like you've been teleported to Japan. Also, all of the dishware is beautiful. It's a great place to catch up with a friend over some coffee - I watched the barista make several drinks and they provided excellent service.Definitely want to come back for the hot cakes and to try their coffee!
Kylor H.}San Francisco, CA}1}13}1}-1}5}10/29/2015}Excellent service and coffees. Very unique place with siphon, aeropress, or pourover of a coffee of your choosing.  The brightest coffee I've had in New York I had here.You'll sit and wait a bit, but it's a great experience if you really love coffee.
Rachel K.}New York, NY}0}53}4}-1}5}10/23/2015}Wow just had a great time here. Great Sake- they let us try four different ones until we found the one we liked. Then we got a bottle and didn't finish it so they let us take it home! The food was also delicious - had the octopus, tuna over rice and the miso cheese. Can't wait took back to this place.
Carlos D.}North Hollywood, CA}0}5}0}-1}5}10/23/2015}Great place for good Japanese style coffee and lunch items.  Staff is extremely cool and friendly.  Will come back for the later part of the evening.  After 6pm, the place becomes a Sake bar!
Robert M.}Southampton, NY}1}16}52}-1}5}10/22/2015}In my opinion this coffee shop with the small menu of delicacies and suites is the benchmark of Japanese class and style! From the super cool bar top vacuum press they make some coffee in. Will stop at the sister restaurants on 10th St. for either a Ramen noodle or a curry and then it's a must stop for a coffee on the way out. To sit down enjoy the ambience what assembly to coffee to go it's definitely an interesting must do in the city!
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}10/19/2015}Like everyone has already said, their katsu sandwich (limited to 10 servings a day!) and hotcakes were really good. They offer a variety of options for coffee and other beverages, and it's fun to watch the Japanese baristas with fedoras make coffee with various interesting looking tools right at the bar. The venue is well-decorated and has a cozy, cute feel. That being said, however, there are a couple of downsides to this place. Firstly, the venue is very small and narrow, which means you have to awkwardly stoop over the bar table while sitting on a rather uncomfortable, high rise chair throughout your meal and you are literally sitting shoulder to shoulder with people around you. Secondly, the portion is really small for the price you pay. My delicious katsu sandwich was gone in 3-4 bites. I would recommend that you either come here for early, light lunch or just coffee on your own, or with one more person at max.
Eileen C.}Philadelphia, PA}136}52}118}-1}4}10/18/2015}Split the pork katsu sandwich and hot cakes with my unnie. The katsu was lovely with uncrusted bread, very thick with crisply fried edges. This is pretty standard fare, but I appreciate how evenly the pork was cooked despite the thick, generous portion (this could be a challenge at times.)I really liked the hotcakes, which we got with fruit (the fruit being banana that is stuffed inside). They were soft, moist, and fluffy. The best part of the hotcakes for me was the lemon butter. It was sooo delicious to spread a small amount of light lemony cream on the cakes. They added a flavor reminiscent of lemon sandwich cookies I've had as a child.And the COFFEEE!!! I got the siphoned Tokyo blend, which really brought out the essence of the bean. I liked the complex flavors that I sipped in the coffee... with very slight chocolate-fruity undertones. Plus, it came in this fabulous flask contraption, which made the experience more awesome!
V U.}Manhattan, NY}5}82}0}-1}4}10/3/2015}Very classy place as per my wife. They know their sake and they also have really good beer. Get the soba ale and fujuku.
Liz C.}Manhattan, NY}43}147}0}-1}4}9/18/2015}Super cute Japanese coffee place with reasonable prices - $4 for a cup of coffee. Very limited space (about 6 seats to a counter), but they're not in a hurry to push you out. They serve sugar as a simple syrup in a glass container... it looks like water, but it's actually sugar water, so don't pour it into your whole cup. Would definitely come again when I'm in the area.
J J.}New York, NY}0}63}0}-1}2}9/8/2015}Nice quaint little place in the EV with a European vibe, but very small in space, only bar stools to enjoy your cup.  Not a place to linger as it doesn't have table seating.  Otherwise, they have a unique coffee technique, blend, presentation, and service.  The taste can be subtle and refreshing than your typical java, depending on your selection.  Overall, a nice place to visit once
Teresa V.}New York, NY}144}155}736}18}4}9/6/2015}QUICK POINTERS* Counter service [1]* Narrow and small space; limited seats* Slightly pricey but definitely worth for the qualityFOOD (experience)* Chocolate Parfait [2]* Katsu Sandwich [3]* Tamago Sandwich [3]* Hot Cakes [4]OVERALLI would recommend stopping by here if you plan on making multiple eating stops throughout the day, like me and my friends are guilty of. Perfect place if you're just looking for some place light to eat, or to grab a cup of coffee or tea. Avoid rush hour because number of seats is limited. 2-stars for food (quality and craftsmanship/presentation), 1-star for service, and 1-star for the welcoming and genuine atmosphere of the restaurant. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -[1] I'm a personal fan of counter services because they allow for more intimate conversations and relation between the server and guest.

Not at all overwhelming in sweetness nor chocolaty factor. [3] Both make for perfect light weight pairings with a good cup of tea! I'm usually more accustomed to the Tamago Sandwich pairing with tea, but the Katsu sandwich has definitely made me re-consider my favorites. So Tamago for the vegetarians and Katsu for the meat lovers.[4] "Oh my goodness it's so fluffy!" Yes! Nice, warm, airy, and very delicately made in front of you.
Connie L.}New York, NY}30}329}136}18}3}8/28/2015}This place is cute but I'm not sure if it's worth the money. I came for lunch with two friends and got the hot cakes and an iced chai latte. The hot cakes were thick, so not the typical pancakes were used to here. Presentation is for the hot cakes was really pretty and they take their time to make it. The chai was really bad. It tasted watered down, wasn't milky, and only had the faintest chai flavor.It's only bar seating here and it's nice that they have hooks for your bags.
Tom F.}New York, NY}4}322}64}18}5}8/27/2015}Hi-Collar is a tiny, narrow space that take you to a completely separate space and attitude from this East Village block. The first word that comes to mind is "classy" - very classy, but not pretentious. The attention to detail and elegance feels genuine, and the bartenders are calm and approachable while still being pretty badass. The dessert I had here wasn't particularly memorable, but I almost don't care because everything else was so spectacularly orchestrated.
Stephen K.}Manhattan, NY}94}77}7}-1}5}8/26/2015}Truly unique place in NYC. I go here for lunch often, and every item on the menu is fantastic, with cheap prices.  The interior is clean and looks pretty badass -- sort of a great-gatsby vibe. The omelets are great, and the katsu sandwich is stellar if you can snag one before they run out.  Somehow, this place always seems surprisingly empty to me, which is also enjoyable. I think if everyone knew how great it is, this would not be the case.The coffee here is also really top notch. This however, this is pricey...so don't expect a daily morning cup from Hi-Collar.I've never been here for Sake though, so I cannot attest to this.Oh yeah, and the bathroom has bidets for days.
Daniel S.}Long Branch, NJ}0}12}0}-1}4}8/26/2015}So cool!  At any moment I was expecting Uma Thurman's character from "Kill Bill" to pop out with a samurai sword.  $8 for a glass of iced coffee is a little much...but the ambiance and unique setting makes up for that.
Tyler L.}Wanaque, NJ}185}1474}1306}18}4}8/24/2015}Very cool Japanese style coffee shop that feels more like the inside of a train car than a normal coffee shop. You can either order to go or sit at the long bar with your drink. If you stay, you can have some sort of strange lab equipment in which your tea is brewed, or go for the Japanese style pour over coffee. Because of the technique, coffee takes some time, but is worth it for the great taste.
Sumito A.}Manhattan, NY}299}418}1032}-1}5}8/23/2015}Get to the Chase:Pros:1) FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE!2) Took my friend to sake-tasting for the first time, and they gave a sampler flight on the house! (Maybe it was because it was Wednesday or the bartender saw how thirsty we were)3) They attention to service was undeniably brilliant! My glass of water was always topped up, the tables and floors were sparkly clean, the bathroom smelt like a leprechaun farting rainbows and butterflies in my face, and the bartender provided asian shrimp-flaovred chips to go with our sake for free. 4) Kodai is a new member of the staff, and he is absolutely the best! He gave us conversation, an explanation of 6 different sakes, and great recommendations. 5) We had 1 cocktail and 1 bottle of nigori shared among three people (which was more than plenty), which came out to $100 after tax and 25% tip. We were there for 3 hours6) Weekdays are the best to go except for Friday, as this place is extremely popular and has limited seating)7) You get to choose your own fancy cup to drink out of (and no you don't get to keep it :P). Cons:1) Very few seats2) Can be extremely busy with hour long waits if you leave it to the weekend.
Shamah J.}Manhattan, NY}4}34}14}-1}2}8/18/2015}Too expensive for normal japanese food. Only had the katsu sandwich and smoothie (x2) with my bf. Wasn't worth the price.
Ruggy J.}Manhattan, NY}4940}2328}4801}18}5}8/18/2015}If you're a coffee dork, you have to put Hi-Collar on your short list.Coffee bar by day, sake bar by night... the high ticket item here is the siphon coffee scientifically created just inches from your seat at the bar. It's much pricier than your average pour over method, but the flavor it yields is unmatched. You can really taste all of the olfactory notes when prepared this way.They also have a fun menu of small bites. The pork katsu sandwich is not to be missed. This is the sort of place you need to sit and stay a while. You're doing yourself a disservice if you're just grabbing a cup to go.
Bell S.}Boston, MA}204}31}51}-1}5}8/14/2015}Best Katsu Sandwich I ever had! Crispy and juicy, served with egg salad and pickled celery - perfect! Also had Coffee Zenzai - good refreshing wrap after the sandwich. And Tokyo blend brought them all together. Love love this place.
Joey L.}New York, NY}131}269}484}18}1}8/7/2015}Seems like if you're coming here for late night dessert, you better not. At night this place is a sake bar and if you're not here to drink, they're going to give you attitude about it and charge way too much for just dessert. The reviews for this place was impressive so my boyfriend and I wanted to check it out after a night happy hours and speakeasy. At this point (11 pm ish) we just wanted some desserts. There were about 4 people at the bar and we were seated at the end. We asked if they had a dessert menu and the guy stressed listed things off. We picked the deluxe, but he made it a point to tell is that this was a sake bar and that we should be ordering drinks. It took them about 15 min to assemble this plate that consisted of two rolls, some ice cream and canned fruits. Most expensive dessert that wasn't even that spectacular. Extremely disappointed. If you didn't want to serve us dessert, just tell us it's not available.
Alexandra C.}Brooklyn, NY}91}18}18}-1}4}8/3/2015}My friend and I were willing to splurge on $6 tea (what can I say, we're broke college students) for the uniqueness of this joint. My matcha green tea was nice and bitter. My friend enjoyed her iced tea. We loved the relaxed service that allowed us to chat for an hour or so without feeling super pressured to leave. We didn't get lunch here; maybe next time! (Also, the bathroom is really gorgeous)
Raul V.}Brooklyn, NY}6}23}1}-1}4}8/1/2015}5 stars for the awesome barista, coffee and food. 4 stars for the level of service that was provided, not by the barista, but by the waitress. Not once did she smile to customers. She gave off this rude, and pretentious attitude. I hope they change her, or even let her go.
Car W.}Shore Acres, Staten Island, NY}0}2}1}-1}1}7/28/2015}I came in this restaurant with high expectations after reading the reviews on yelp. The place was very cozy with only bar seating. My main purpose in writing this review is to express my disgust with the customer service here. Thirty minutes in to being seated, we were told that the kitchen and cash register was closing so we had to pay before we even received our ordered desserts. A young woman with heavy eye makeup handed us our check. Noticing that she handed us the wrong check, she quickly grabbed it out of my friend's hand without even apologizing. I thought that this was extremely rude. I read other reviews on here and another yelper seemed to experience similar customer service from the same waitress. When we decided to pay using card, we left the tip area empty on the receipt. I intended on leaving the tip on the table when we left. The same young woman received our receipt. She came back to us with an awful attitude, "You no pay tip?!" After I told her that I intended on leaving the tip on the table instead of having it charged to the card, she left us alone. Aside from the awful awful awful customer service here, I have to say the overpriced dessert here didn't meet my expectations. Should've went to Chikalicious.
Patcharaorn T.}Manhattan, NY}112}39}378}-1}5}7/25/2015}Let me start by saying "Wonderful"!!!This is the kind of place that will make you feel so right at home. During lunch, I went to get some parfait and tea with my sister. And yes, it was DELISH!!! I personally enjoyed the coffee, I drink everything black and let me tell you, it was delightful.I went there again at night, after 7pm, the converted from a little cozy coffee shop to a nice small bar that served good sake. And yes, I have parfait again. I was so good I couldn't resist not to order them.
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}5}7/15/2015Updatedreview}Actually nevermind... I've come here way to many times to even count.First off, you want coffee? OK! Yuki-san can make the best aeropress, pour over, and even siphon coffee you'll need in your life. Personally I love the Tokyo Blend coffee, It is a little bit acidic and stronger but that's not a bad thing at all.No espresso, NO NO NO espresso. Vietnamese latte is to die for.6pmGo in and sit, let one of the amazing bartenders serve you.One of my favorite sakes would have been the Dassai 50 nigori, it is still one of my favorites.But now, I will also suggest my top favorite(besides the ones at Decibel)1. Shinpaku2. Dassai 50 Nigori3. Fukuju4. And the Yamahai varieties.One of the things I would suggest is to get a sake flight:Dassai Nigori, Shinpaku, FukujuThat's my most sincere recommendation.
Johnson B.}Manhattan, NY}2}342}10}-1}5}7/13/2015}Excellent Japanese Sake bar. I love the atmosphere, the people are very nice, and the food is creative. I wish they had coffee/tea in the evenings, would love to have tried it.
Andrew T.}Queens, NY}104}14}8}-1}5}7/3/2015}Mmmm the omurice with the gravy and katsu. The place is a little small just counter seating. It's cute that they do specialty coffees also. I need to come back to try their sandwiches and desserts
Leo L.}New York, NY}118}375}1200}18}4}6/24/2015}What is a Coffee shop during the day, turns into a cool, laid back sake bar at night. One long counter and about 10-11 seats fits this place. Snugged and barely any standing room. I enjoyed the tako wasa. Everything else I ordered foodwise was less than memorable. If you're new to sake and can't decide, ask the bartender. He'll recommend you something based on your flavor preference. A good choice if you're looking to catch up with a friend in a somewhat quiet place.
Masa T.}ASTORIA, NY}10}56}405}-1}4}6/21/2015}You can get real/local Japanese food in SoHo. Their omelet over rice is awesome. I should have ordered in large size. Green tea parfait makes you feel that you're eating it at 喫茶店 (a local and kinda old Japanese style cafe). 雰囲気最高です。日本に帰りたいけど帰れない人、行きたいけど行けない人、来る価値めちゃアリです。
Ellie H.}Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA}10}61}162}-1}5}6/21/2015}Oh my god, it's definitely the best Omurice!! A really traditional Japanese style cafe. Nice place for lunch, coffee and dessert. Definitely come back again.Small but cozy.
Teresa C.}New York, NY}149}452}1630}18}2}6/15/2015Updatedreview}Came back to try their LUNCH MENU.PROS:- No wait on Monday Afternoon. Place was empty when I came in.THE OKAY:- KATSU SANDWICH $13- the highly acclaimed katsu sandwich was MEDIOCRE. Yes it's moist but the sandwich was kind of cold. I would have expected the katsu to be hot as it should have just came out from fryer but it was not.- MISTY VALLEY MIZUDASHI ICED COFFEE $5 (coffee brand: 1000 faces from Ethiopia) [blueberry cobbler and dark chocolate] : This was alright.  I am not a coffee expert so I had the barista recommend me a flavor and she told me most female customers liked Misty Valley for its fruity taste but I did not taste the blueberry and dark chocolate flavor as the description said it should taste like. I like that Mizudashi Coffee is NOT ACIDIC OR BITTER but the coffee in general tasted WATERED DOWN.NOTE: $10 Minimum per person and to use credit card.
Gabby S.}Brooklyn, NY}437}207}92}18}1}6/8/2015}Merp .My best friend and I came here last night. I was super excited about trying it maybe it's better during the day. When we came in at 10:00  guy said they were still serving food so we decided to try it .We had the raw octopus with wasabi the portion was super small . But it was really good this was the best part of the meal.We had the pork katsu jeez man it was so salty and I am the queen of salty. It was just so salty that even 2 cups of water didn't help. Speaking of water he would walk past us and not refill our cups even though there was no one else really there  . It wasn't crowded he wasn't busy he just seemed like he didn't wanna help out.We had the potato salad it was alright.The last thing we had was the dessert deluxe and my best friend was super mad because for 20 dollars you get one strawberry roll which was really dry , a scoop of ice cream and this walnut? Pound cake .Overall it was a pretty shitty experience it took waaaay too long to order.... Waaaay too long to get a water refill.. Food was waaaay to salty:((
Stephanie L.}New York, NY}486}126}494}18}5}6/4/2015}Five stars hands down. Cute cafe in the morning/noon, bar at night, and I love them both. The staff is super cute and nice. They're all Japanese! There are not many seats (probably 10 max?) and they don't take reservations. But I would come eat again and again and again. Will never get sick of it. Plus it's just a great place to chill and talk with friends~I ALWAYS get the omurice. The egg is SO FLUFFY. And who doesn't love ketchup? But if you actually don't like ketchup they have other sauces as well. You can also add toppings to your omurice now such as mushrooms and katsu. YES PLEASE. TO EVERYTHING. Their drinks are also lovely~ especially because their cup sets are beautiful. Link:stefoodography.com/hi-co…
CS B.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}5}5/23/2015}Stepping into Hi-Collar, you're instantly transported to early 20th century Osaka. This cozy spot is a Coffee bar by day and Sake bar by night. The coffee is great, made to order with quite alot of choice of beans. No sulking, hipster baristas at this place, you get a very high level of service from friendly Japanese servers. And if you never eat anything else the rest of your life, you must have a Katsu sandwich here. They only make 10 a day, they're so good, you'll order all 10 of 'em.
Brian N.}New York, NY}223}28}1}-1}5}5/22/2015}This place is a coffee / tea shop by day and a sake bar by night.  The sake is amazing, the bartenders are willing to help you choose / taste exactly what you're looking for, not too many seats (10-12) and well kept.  My new go to date spot late night.
Dennis L.}New York, NY}77}196}1}-1}4}5/18/2015}Cute cafe.  Only ordered a cup of coffee to go from here, and just from that, realized I probably want to return.  Dedication to quality, and not caring for just high volume turnover is evident here.  The price of a cup of drip coffee is pretty standard, but each cup is painstakingly made by the (barista?), rather than batch-made by some machine and just poured for you.  Seating here is rather limited, as it is just one bar.  Hopefully I don't end up waiting too long for a seat when I come back to sample their other offerings.
Leonard L.}TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY}746}1405}3931}18}5}5/14/2015}Hi-CollarNY Manhattan East Village1pm Thursday 14th May 2015Five StarsThis is a cool experience. It reminds me of an old fashion ice cream/coffee counter owned and operated by actual Japanese people. I ordered a Japanese Ice Coffee ($3.8) with Fordenza Brazilian Coffee Bean ($1 extra). She personally measured and ground the beans. Then she did a pour over. The coffee came in a copper mug with cold draft ice. The coffee was strong and enjoyable. The 6 Japanese girls sitting to my right ordered food which looked delicious. The pasta of day, the tobiko omelette, and Katsu Sandwich looked amazing. I will have to return.
Cristina F.}Weehawken, NJ}18}164}44}-1}4}5/5/2015}Stumbled upon this place by accident when looking for a bar to grab a drink before dinner at Buenos Aires. Boy were we pleasantly surprised and transported toTokyo.  What a cozy spot with only a smallbar with about 8 seats. We had some sake ( they had many different types and the kind bartender let us taste first before deciding on one ). The couple next to us were grilling stingray which seemed kind of cool. I give Hi Collar an A+ for presentation as we were served our drinks on little trays with a vase of fresh flowers.
Kiki P.}Raleigh, NC}2}28}49}-1}5}5/3/2015}I LOVE hi collar. If I lived in the area I would make this my regular hang out. Their Demi glaze omu rice was so amazing I can't stop thinking about it. 10/10
Rena Y.}Calgary, Canada}124}158}765}-1}4}4/23/2015}Hi-Collar gives you a glimpse of historical Japan. True to the original form of Japanese coffee houses, Hi-Collar embraces Dutch style in its interior design and has an impressive offering of coffees, teas, and kissaten (Japanese cafe) food.Japan was introduced to coffee at around the end of the 18th century by the Dutch living in Nagasaki at the time. By the end of the 19th century when coffee could be imported in to the country in bulk, drinking coffee became widely popular.Historians say the first coffee shop opened its doors in Tokyo in 1888. The well-to-do romanticized North American culture, so at the time, coffee houses were the place to be seen, much like when Starbucks first embarked on establishing its coffee empire. Donning North American clothes and being coifed accordingly was a status symbol.When at Hi-Collar, be sure to try their coffees. Prepared cup-by-cup using one of several filtration methods - be it siphon, cold-brew or pour-over, the cafe has you covered. And the variety of beans?! Endless. Consult the brew master should you get lost in the sea of options. To go with your beverage, try their katsu-sandwich, which sells out early in the day, or the mentaiko-pasta. These are my favorite dishes in the restaurant. For dessert, you can't go wrong, going with one of their daily specials or their "hot-cakes", which is what the Japanese call the pancake.
Nancy W.}Marina del Rey, CA}41}12}3}-1}5}4/16/2015}Really chic place~~perfect presentation of sake and food, love the bartender who reminds me my Japanese friend. ^_^
Doreen L.}Queens, NY}1116}894}5594}18}4}4/13/2015}What an adorable Japanese cafe! A matronly Japanese woman greeted us on a sunny Sunday. Beautiful cherry blossoms were perched on a vase behind her. Slim East Villagers filled the narrow bar, sipping their afternoon cup of joe.There were two empty seats in this 13 stool cafe. Our group contained 6 people.We opted for the Hi-collar take out menu. At Hi-collar, they offer hot drip coffee or cold brewed hand dripped coffee. The beans are ground per order- which makes the wait slightly longer but oh so fresh!The cup of hot coffee on this breezy Sunday afternoon was wonderful. The quality could rival one of my favorites- Blue Bottle.Will definitely be back!
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}120}252}27}-1}5}3/16/2015Updatedreview}Katsu sandwich as good as they say.Egg salad sandwich more like an omelette sandwich, but the best one you'll ever have because of that wasabi sauce.No crust = cherry on top of a cherry.
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}5}3/14/2015}What a gem! I've passed by this place a few times before but finally decided to stop in and have lunch after seeing it listed as one of the best coffee houses in America. And truly, us New Yorkers are fortunate to have this authentic Japanese style 'kissaten' right in the East village. One step inside and I immediately felt like I was back in Japan. Even more so when I examined the menu. They serve classic dishes like mentaiko (spicy cod roe) cream spaghetti, omu-rice (rice stuffed omelet), tonkatsu sandwich and thick fluffy pancakes. Yes, for the uninitiated this menu sounds bizarre but I ordered the mentaiko cream spaghetti and I went straight to foodie heaven! It's exactly how I remember it. This is definitely a cafe that banks on the nostalgia factor. The barista, with whom I chatted with in Japanese, told me that they get a lot of patrons who used to live in Japan as well as Japanese born New Yorkers. And as for the coffee, they definitely take their coffee seriously. Try the siphon method or the airopress if you've never had your coffee made that way before. I tried the aeropress for the first time and I liked it. At night this place stops serving coffee and becomes a sake bar. I'd have to check then out for that as well.
A L.}Manhattan, NY}5}11}4}-1}5}2/23/2015}In a neighborhood that never seems to be in shortage of Japanese places, Hi-Collar is a refreshing choice that stands out amongst other boring and generic Japanese places scattered all over the area. Came here for lunch and ordered their popular katsu sandwich that really blew me away. The katsu was tender while still crispy at the same time and was incredibly tasty. We also ordered the omurice, which is basically an omelette made with fried rice and served with ketchup. It was simple but satisfying. Tried their brazil aeropress along with our food, which was fantastic! It totally hit the spot with a strong peanutty taste and heavy body. Their apple crumble cake was surprisingly underwhelming and disappointing; the cake was cold and I would steer clear of it. Though Hi-Collar can be cramped at times due to its narrow interior that doesn't accommodate that many seats, it's a solid place to get coffee and light food. It's also a great place to get drip coffee to go in the day. Their coffee is incredibly rich in flavor and has a subtle nutty taste. Service is always extremely friendly and their coffee is possibly my favorite in the neighborhood!
Fanny W.}Syosset, NY}77}53}135}-1}4}2/22/2015}Very interesting experience! Seating is limited and only at the counter. Was entertained watching the waitress make the siphoned coffee behind the counter. Coffee was very rich and smooth. I normally do not like drinking coffee black but the coffee was smooth and flavorful enough to drink by itself. We also had the aeropress coffee which was good but does not compare to the siphoned coffee. We also had a slice of apple crumble pie which was delicious. Overall very nice experience although a little expensive.
Jeff M.}Somerville, MA}185}765}24}-1}4}2/12/2015}Come for the personal siphon.  Stay for the toilet.
Meng X.}New York, NY}16}11}53}-1}4}2/7/2015}Very cute and elegant bar restaurant. Food is delicate and delicious. Nice quite place for close friends to hang out.
Kevin C.}New York, NY}272}533}221}18}4}1/8/2015}This is a super cool Japanese spot which is a coffee shop by day and a speakeasy by night. I've only visited during the evening so this review is just about the bar experience.Hi-Collar specializes in Japanese spirits. They have a wide variety of sake and they also have some rare Japanese craft beers. I don't know much about sake, but the staff is very helpful and will let you try a few different types before you order. Once you order they'll serve your drinks on a fancy platter with a flower vase. It's a picture perfect opportunity to take a snapshot and post to social media so you can make all your friends jealous. A word of caution: they don't have any non-Japanese liquor. I once saw a group of four who came in and promptly left after they realized that the bar didn't serve traditional cocktails.If you're looking forward to trying some Japanese liquor that you'll be hard pressed to find elsewhere then Hi-Collar is the place for you!
Dani P.}Arlington, VA}78}746}573}18}5}1/5/2015}My friend absolutely needed this stop to be part of her NY trip. It's a tiny place with a counter that extends from the back of the place to the front. It's very narrow.  Random: they have a really nice bathroom with a Japanese toilet. If you've never experienced a Japanese toilet before, you might be intimidated by all the buttons and the fact that the seat is warm.During the day, they're a japanese cafe. At night, they become a sake bar. We stopped in and ordered coffee. They are serious about the coffee with different methods and blends; they served ours in Japanese tea bowls instead of the expected mug. These coffees are high quality, and though they offer cream and sugar, it isn't really necessary.They have small food dishes. We ordered hot cakes and egg sandwiches, which reminded my friend and I greatly of Japanese cafes when we were in Japan. We topped off the meal by sharing a great fruit parfait.If you're really hungry, you probably should go to one of the places next door. This place is great for an intimate social hour with a friend and/or for the coffee enthusiast.
Ethan A.}Boston, MA}0}57}1}-1}5}12/29/2014}Beautiful old style Japanese Coffee and Saki bar. They offer nice small plates of japanese style tapas, desserts, teas and coffee and a great selection of saki.When you oder your saki you get to pick from a collection of really cool looking glasses.The place is really small and can only fit around 10 people but it is very cozy and a nice place to visit
Yan L.}Manhattan, NY}122}22}162}-1}5}12/28/2014}Delicious food!!!! I tried the sandwich with fried pork, it tasted delicious, only 10 servings per day !!!! I also tried the omelet with fried rice, it was delicious as well! I strongly recommended
Micco W.}New York, NY}33}44}46}-1}5}12/22/2014}This place is amazing. I ordered the hot cake with seasonal fruit in it( banana) and its soooooo good! My boyfriend ordered the katsu sandwich and it's amazing! The katsu is perfectly tasty and crunchy, and the bread is even cut out without the crust. The only thing is the proportion is kinda small, we need to go to the desert shop next door to get more to eat, we could have ordered the dessert here im sure they will be pretty good too. I'm definitely going to come back here and order their spaghetti of the day and the omelet fried rice next time
Katrina L.}Manhattan, NY}175}378}98}-1}2}12/22/2014}Venue - Very cute vintage cafe/bar. The space is small and narrow, with only bar seating and about 10 stools.They serve different things throughout the day:11 - 4 breakfast/lunch4 - 6 afternoon coffee/tea and desserts7 - 12 sake barFood and Drinks:- Coffee is slowly brewed in unique bunsen-burner-like-equipment.- Vietnamese iced coffee is on the bitter side. I would try their other coffee selections.- The seasonable apple crumble cake was just cold apple pie. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expected. I would skip it and order something else.- Chocolate parfait was nice and light. You can taste the coffee in the jelly.- Sake - wide selection, about $15 a glass on average- Salted fish bar snack (not sure what its called) but omg it was so salty it was inedible- Overall, overpriced mediocre foodService.- SLOW.- Inattentive and forgetful.So I go in with a friend. They take my friend's order but not mine. There are two servers for a small bar of only 10 people. Even with that ratio, trying to get one of their attention is surprisingly difficult. And once I got to order, they forgot my order. And after reminding them of my order, I had to remind them again and finally received my drink and food after much confusion on their part and after my friend was more than halfway done with hers (and she was trying to be slow to wait for me).3 stars for the food and pricing, 1 star for service.
Jill R.}New York, NY}498}91}479}-1}4}11/23/2014}Went here for lunch and got the daily pasta. It's a very small and narrow place just like Curry Ya. The pasta was creamy with roe and dried seaweed on top. I recommend it! Ate it pretty fast. Definitely want to come again to check out the dessert! :)
Takako T.}New York, NY}69}268}180}-1}5}11/6/2014}Love love love this cozy little joint. I don't understand why we haven't had this kind of sake bar till now. With only 10 seats or so, you always get full attention from the bartender and get a good suggestion about what to get even if you are not familiar with sake.The location itself is really convenient too. Surrounded by sea of restaurants, you can use this bar for the start of a nigh or after dinner chat. I'd rather come here with my date than loud group of friends.
Deirdre L.}Brooklyn, NY}293}441}143}18}4}11/2/2014}Nice presentation, but pretty basic food for a large price. And the coffee was made special (siphon) but it was not spectacular. Very cute date place experience, but i seek places that have other than basic food.
Thomas V.}Manhattan, NY}74}45}40}-1}5}11/2/2014}Hmmm I would say this is probably the best coffee I had in NYC (maybe one other place that contends, still debating).  Things are just really fresh and real. Wifey and I had 1 iced (cold brew mizudashi) and 1 hot (siphon w/ tokyo blend).  Both were great with a slight nod to the mizudashi.  You take a sip and can tell the quality immediately.  I wasn't sure if NYC could compare to the quality of European coffee, like those in Vienna we tried multiple times a day.  But I have to say this is pretty close, if not better in different ways.  They siphon the coffee in front of you too, so that kept us entertained (we are easily amused).We also had the katsu pork sandwich and banana fruit hot cake.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfect meal to have with the coffee.  Man, really love this place.  I would recommend to others.  Would also put it on the covenant of "must try places" for those visiting from out of town (yes that select list that all of us have when visitors ask us for reccs), if they love coffee...it's that good.We also had the chocolate parfait.  Would prob try the fruit or coffee parfait next time though.Be prepared to pay some, but it's not break your wallet kind of expensive.  Can't wait to come back! Check out the Japanese bidet. That's real.
Sarah K.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}425}265}25}-1}4}10/28/2014}This is a tiny, tiny place - but I think that adds to the charm of this Japanese cafe. Stepping in, I was reminded of the typical cafe in animes, where the counter is gold, and what not. I came here on a Saturday at around 1PM and managed to get a seat - although it did get more and more crowded as time went on. We had to shift seats more than once.For food, I ordered the omurice, since I was craving a rice dish. The rice portion was typical, but the egg was so fluffy! I don't think I've had such a silky, fluffy omelet in my life. I also had green tea, which was great. My friend had the pasta of the day (mentaiko) which also looked good. The prices seem a bit steep for such plain dishes, which is my only gripe about this place.We asked about the tonkatsu sandwich (which I wish I got now), and they said that that day they were selling 20! So, it's not so difficult to get, I think.Service was good - getting the check was a bit of a hassle since they were so busy with so many costumers. They happily greeted us as we came and went.
Jie S.}New York, NY}63}18}6}-1}5}10/23/2014}Love this place! Always come here with friends. People here are nice and friendly.They have the best 琉球 ume shu in the city. The Katsu sandwich is super good!!!!!! I have that every time. Also love the fruit parfait. Late night sukiyaki saved me and my friend from starvation. We will come here every week!
Eater O.}New York, NY}8}60}12}-1}5}10/2/2014}Feels like you're in Tokyo. Beautiful aesthetic. Excellent coffee by day and even better sake experience by night. Elegant presentation of drink and food. A favorite.
Bo C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}9}1}-1}5}9/16/2014}Very Japanese. Good authentic bar food and sake. Great service too.
Zuzzi E.}New York, NY}188}551}17}-1}3}9/11/2014}I've walked past this spot a million times, admiring the adorably vintage interior. I finally decided to come by for brekky one Sunday morning. We were the only ones there and ordered the pancakes. Perhaps they had to go out and pick up the batter because it took 35 minutes for those pancakes to arrive on my plate.They were delicious. But I was hangry and now I associate that feeling with this place.
Amy S.}Brooklyn, NY}100}485}124}-1}4}8/26/2014}I only went for dessert & coffee and it's a bit pricey, but it's pretty good. we shared the matcha pound cake and an iced coffee. there were some communication issues (they were making me tea when i asked for cake) but overall they're friendly even though it's small... heh. haven't had the food but looking at the photos, the food looks yum.
Rob N.}Brooklyn, NY}3}27}2}-1}5}8/19/2014Updatedreview}Came back and still great. Such great sake and service. Food, too. I've been telling lots of people about the place since and expect to go again and again. I'm in love.
Carmen G.}Oakland Gardens, NY}325}237}532}-1}4}8/6/2014}For a cramped 11 seater place, it exceeded my expectations. Once you step in (which brings you 1/4 way into the bar), you're instantly transported to a prohibition WWII feel era where you're just drinking and having a good time without worrying about the outside world. Definitely a cool experience. This turns into a sake bar after 7pm. Prior to that, I heard it was a dessert place. Cool bathroom!
Ting-Hsuan H.}New York, NY}1}8}10}-1}5}8/3/2014}A small, cozy place. The pancake is good but nothing special. However, the chocolate parfait is amazing. I'll come back for it.
Stef S.}New York, NY}123}724}4}18}1}7/26/2014}Came in on a Friday night trying to order coffee and desserts, because I was under the impression this was a coffee joint. It's a coffee place turned bar at night. The place had only three customers with plenty of spots at the bar. The staff was apparently not happy that we were not ordering booze, because when we tried to see the dessert menu they lied and said they did not serve dessert. (I obviously yelped the place first....). They also said they don't serve coffee at night. Ok fine fair enough, so we tried to order one entree and a dessert, and they were apparently still unhappy that we were not ordering more. They told us they were going to charge us $15 for the dessert as a "special price" for not ordering enough... just... arbitrarily. Wtf. No thanks. Your restaurant is half empty. If you want to only serve booze, then don't be a coffee shop turned restaurant turned bar wanna be. Make up your mind. Also, if you are "only" serving drinks, then tell us before we sit down. Don't seat us, ignore us, and then give us a hard time and try to charge us random prices just to be jerks about it.Oh btw, we saw the menu of desserts on a board as we walked outside the restaurant... Such a shame, I thought they looked good based on the reviews.Lastly, I'd like to point out that many of these "rave" reviews come from people who have only posted one review on yelp ever. Yeah, way to bolster your ratings with fake reviews.
Asa N.}Brooklyn, NY}18}109}165}-1}5}6/29/2014}My gf and I were waiting in front of curry-ya next door. We got there at 11nish in the morning and curry-ya wasn't open yet. We were starving and decided to try this place out. I really like their egg salad sandwich. They serve pasta, salad and sandwich for lunch and it's a bar that serve snacks at night time.
Sh F.}Manhattan, NY}0}40}8}-1}5}6/12/2014}Coffee: 5 starsThe enthusiasm, knowledge, dedication to coffee...just amazing. Wide range of bean selections and always evolving/expanding. As a customer, I love the choice of different methodologies to prepare coffee.I'd recommend anyone to let the barristers know your preferences regarding the coffee and ask their recommendations including which types of preparation is recommended for your choice of bean.Food: 5 starsIt's a Japanese 'Kissaten' menu, but has varieties of dishes from Pasta and Teishoku (Japanese-style lunch combo) for lunch. Some dishes change at daily basis so those who go to Hi-Collar as regular customer would be satisfied as well.Most Japanese in NYC who discovered this place go back to Hi-Collar to seek real Japanese cafe foodsMy recommendations:-Hot Cakes-Daily Pasta-Osaka-Style Egg Sandwich-Pork Katsu Sandwich-Omu RicePrice: 5 starsI was surprised for both coffee and food how reasonable the place is. The food menu is definitely lower than the average Japanese places, including Japanese cafes.Service:Just Excellent!!!Everybody is so friendly and we clearly can see their pride in excellent services.I assume I've communicated with most staffs by now (I've been to Hi-Collar for almost a year), but I find that there is no exception, and everybody who works there is great so far.Atmosphere: 5 starsIt's a counter only, small space but done a great job of resurrecting old-school/traditional Japanese cafeInside of cafe is so clean including the restroom, which is hard to find at cafe nowadays, so you can tell the whole place is maintained well.
Harue J.}Manhattan, NY}12}261}31}18}3}6/9/2014}Came here for lunch and it was empty.  It's tiny and has only a dozen or so seats along the bar, but it's groovy in a quiet way.  Food option is limited.  I had "omu-rice" a typical japanese lunch dish.  It was okay - rice a tad too sweet but the egg on top was nice, fluffy and not overcooked.  The iced coffee was great.  It's a tiny neighborhood gem to sit w/ a glass of something good.
Lucy L.}FOREST HILLS, NY}61}103}85}-1}3}6/4/2014}Limited menu choices. But they do have specials of the day. My Omurice was actually pretty good! Loved the bacon bits in the rice. Then cashier accused us of not paying tips when we clearly left it with the total amount.Sorry to say their water cups need to be a lot bigger than a shot glass so the waiter doesn't have to pour it over 8 times for every meal a person.Smart trick for more tips? Idk
Alex F.}Manhattan, NY}4}36}1}-1}1}6/4/2014}This place is a SCAM!!!Their yelp page suggested it was a dessert-type of place, so.. I decided to check it out after dinner... So,My date and I arrived at 11pm, the place has 10-12 seats all lined up against a bar, all of which were taken up.  So, we both waited approx. 20 minutes to ultimately get seated. Once seated, we were given a dinner menu, where their unique dish was a BBQ stingray (cooked by patron at the bar).... We had just had dinner, so... We just decided we would order dessert.... Our server said... it was still "dinner time," however, it was about 11:30pm by then, and nobody at the bar was having dinner.... Most were drinking Sake'.  What can I do? I had already waited for a seat outside, and wanted to see what the big deal was with their 4.5 stars... So... We said we would order some sake, and hit the road.A couple of minutes later, we were given a "lunch menu," which displayed 3 desserts.  The first was a "Chocolate Parfait," the second "Japanese Gelatin," and third was a "coffee something something."  Then we were told that the price on the menu was DOUBLE that displayed on it... Which was quite frankly offensive and misleading... Once again, we had already made the trip, waited for a seat, and finally given the option of trying a dessert at this place... We figured, fine... We will pay the double price.  Then we were told the only thing available was the chocolate parfait. FINE!!When it finally came, it was basically chocolate ice cream with some granola and a couple of pieces of sliced fruit.    SCAM !!! I am sorry, but I will not be returning to this restaurant, and I hope you guys can be stronger where I was weak... lol
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}5}5/26/2014}A homey joint if you love coffee and like Western Japanese. I came two days in a row for lunch. The first day I arrived at 4pm, which according to their website is last call but they moved it to 3:30pm I think on the on-site menu. Service is really cheerful - all of the people who work there obviously love working there. I tried the iced coffee Mizudashi style and the aeropress iced coffee. No acidity. Comes in a nice copper mug with liquid sugar and milk. Food wise, I've tried the katsu sandwich (portion is small, the little sides are delicious), the ichigo daifuku (it's a sliced red bean daifuku mochi with a strawberry stuffed inside and a dollop of cream, expensive but yum), pasta of the day (spicy cod roe with tons of seaweed shavings on top, yum), the hot cakes (smells great, based on all of the reviews, I expected fluffier, still very much a pancake in case you were wondering).I didn't have an opportunity to check out the blingy bathroom. Love the decor in general - paper flowers are above your head. The bar is brass-colored.Don't come with a big group - seats for 1 and 2 are much easier. Credit cards accepted for $10+.
Alezander W.}Parsippany, NJ}14}208}0}-1}4}5/23/2014}When I came in, I was immediately greeted by the manager (I think), who offered me a menu. There was another family inside, and she was so sweet to their daughter, which made the sit down experience even better. There are a couple of bar stools, and you see the cook make everything right in front of you. I had the fruit parfait, and it was decent. The fruit was really sweet and ripe, but the cake underneath was a bit dry. Either way, the cream did help in making it all a delicious bite after bite. Before you leave, definitely check out the bathroom too! There's a hi-tech Japanese toilet that has a heated seat!
Sarah L.}Falls Church, VA}145}443}530}-1}5}5/12/2014}Simple, meticulous, and effortlessly Japanese. This is the perfect spot for a leisurely breakfast. The attention to detail, right down to the decor, makes for a lovely experience. Even the bathroom (albeit a claustrophobic setting to do one's business), has thoughtful touches, such as a stained glass entryway, toothpicks to ensure one is presentable, and the quintessential Japanese heated toilet seat. The pace is slow, so pack patience and the newspaper or iPad. (Or the paper pad.) For a more substantial meal, I recommend the omurice, otherwise, expect light fare. Hotcakes seem to be the popular option among fellow patrons. Try the siphon method if you haven't experienced it before. Though pricey, the coffee was outright flavorful and the preparation method had a mad scientist or steampunk vibe. It makes me want to buy my own siphon to replicate at home, even though I already own a Chemex and Melitta, so it's not like I need another coffee gadget. On a second visit, I tried the pour over, which was also excellent. For non-coffee aficionados, the loose leaf tea according to a friend, was just as good, and was presented in a dainty bone china tea cup and saucer. Come, sit, and linger.
Yi Z.}Astoria, NY}10}13}18}-1}5}5/9/2014}Scrambled eggs ticks all the boxes in my fat, pretentious head. I had the aero hot coffee, the flavors were robust: fruity and dark cholcolaticiousyish.The ambiance is cozy and the decor is really cute, so bring your girlfriend(s). The prices are great when considering the care they put into their products. Also, they are super friendly, which is a huge plus. The washroom is refreshingly clean, neat, comfortable, and actually quite beautiful. I think I'll go back just to see that gilded restroom once more. Try the bidet, its buckets of fun!
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}4}5/8/2014}i love this place!don't make the mistake of others by bringing coffee into a place that specializes in coffee brewing...hi-collar is awesome because it is bar seating only. it is a coffee/breakfast place during the day and a sake bar at night. what's not to love? as far as coffee, it is always nice to sit and experience the process of what i am often too lazy to do at home (sticking to my espresso machine most mornings).as far as food, i will say the katsu and egg sandwich are underwhelming. i can make better katsu and therefore a better sandwich. the japanese hotcakes, on the other hand, are exactly what i order every time. it is fluffy and the accompanying butter infused with citrus is delicious!come here knowing that you want coffee and a small accompaniment and be sated. come to expect a hearty meal and be sad.
Peter C.}Salisbury, MD}66}151}72}-1}4}4/24/2014}Cool little place! The coffee selections were awesome but over sold - subtle notes of chocolate? Meh. Still, a unique breakfast joint with decent, light food. The sake bar is a great idea and I hope to try it.Btw - the bathroom was also a must try....
Maki Y.}New York, NY}293}244}358}-1}5}4/21/2014}I remember spending a few long, empty afternoons during summer vacations in my paternal grandparents' kissaten staring, mezmerized, at the drip coffee as cups clanked against saucers and feet shuffled around me. A kissaten to me has a very nostalgic and particular definition to it: it's a combination of a restaurant and a cafe, with a relaxed vibe, various coffee brewing techniques, and food that's Western with a Japanese flair. There has to be an omelette (omurice) with tomato-flavored rice underneath, and crustless - always! - sandwiches with Japanese fillings. Hi-Collar, a small and charming 11-seater kissaten in the East Village, is exactly the kissaten that fits my definition. I want you to go, dear reader, so you can understand my excitement, but I also don't want you to go because I don't want it to get over-crowded. Dilemma.They serve breakfast 10am-11am daily with set items that start at $4, and lunch service 11am-3:30pm daily. Each of the food items is $2 less when ordered with a drink, so do yourself a favor and get a drink here. You'll be missing out otherwise. More on that later. -Katsu SandwichTwo pieces of white bread (with the crusts cut off!) softly covered a juicy piece of Berkshire pork katsu. I was surprised at how juicy it was.  The spoonful of tartar sauce was served on a cute clam-shaped plate on the side and added the perfect amount of sourness and creaminess to the sandwich. Loved.-Hot CakesThese were Japanese-style pancakes meaning they were incredibly fluffy and already sweetened (the sugar and vanilla were already added to the batter). It didn't need to be doused in maple syrup, though the whipped orange butter was a delightful addition - the orange rinds were crunchy and the honey made it easier to spread. -Daily PastaThey were serving a really wonderful mentaiko (spicy cod roe) spaghetti with enoki and I'm so glad J made us order this in addition to our two plates. The spaghetti at Hiroko's Place in SoHo has got nothing on Hi-Collar's spaghetti! The sauce, a combination of mentaiko and olive oil/butter, was so creamy and flavorful and really just the simplest, but most elegant, sauce to mix with enoki and al dente spaghetti.-Mizudashi Iced Coffee (cold brew) and the Japanese Iced Coffee (hand drip brew over ice with choice of bean)It was a warm day so we opted for iced coffees. The Mizudashi, a method of brewing coffee over a really long period of time (24 hours at Hi-Collar!) to eliminate bitterness and acidity, was incredibly refreshing and easy to drink even for a non-coffee drinker like myself. The Japanese iced coffee was much darker, bitter, and complex, so the milk and syrup helped.The staff members were so friendly and accommodating, and their positive energy infectious. I love this place so much. Likelihood of another visit:SO likely. I'm not much of a coffee drinker (my taste buds can't handle the bitterness), but since Hi-Collar offers drip, aeropress, and siphon methods of brewing hot coffee, I'd love to try one of those next time. Plus, the bubbling siphon just looks so cool! This kissaten turns into a sake bar at night, which I'd love to check out, but I am already more than happy with this as a kissaten.
Ann L.}New York, NY}9}150}0}-1}3}4/17/2014}Servers are nice, attention to detail nice, but man, do they have a lot of rules (each person has to buy a drink, $10 minimum, can't bring in outside foods). At night, prices are kind of on the high side, no non-alcoholic drinks but tea for the pregnant lady available, and limited food menu. I had to order fish cakes for $5 to meet the minimum... seven pieces of thinly sliced processed pink/white fish cake that I recognize from every other Asian supermarket. Wow. I thought they'd at least make their own fishcake.  A beer, basic tea and fake fish cake for $25... steep for my taste. Not sure I'd go back.
Cheryl L.}Los Angeles, CA}831}290}5025}18}2}4/15/2014}Was super excited to come here because i love love asian sandwiches but sandwiches here were only okay... thought i would enjoy it more but it was kind of bland and the bread wasn't as fluffy and yummy
Thi T.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}4/13/2014}Cute coffee bar by day and sake bar at night. Great service and very attentive staff. First time having raw octopus, not sure what to expect but surprisingly really good. Nice texture, good flavor, would get it again.
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}3}4/3/2014}I was so excited to come here, but the food didn't meet expectations, sadly. I had the sukiyaki (tapas of the day). $13 for miso soup, salad (mine was kabocha squash), rice, and a bowl of sukiyaki. The eggs and beef were well cooked, but the flavors were far too strong and and there was a thick sauce enveloping the tofu that made it a little difficult for me to eat. I'd come back to try the ice cream or the sandwiches, but definitely disappointed.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}4}4/1/2014}Small, counter-only spot in the E. Village, this japanese/western coffee place serves up high quality drinks and eats.   This place is owned by the Curry-ya ppl and as soon as you walk in you see an interesting decor that blends west and east.  On the ceiling are cherry blossom-esque decorations that are fake but still looks good.  To the left behind the counter are various western style coffee machines.  Firstly the coffee, you get to pick the beans and how you want it to be served they have drip over coffee, aero, and siphon.  Aero is $1 more then the drip and siphon is $1 more then the aero.  The barista didnt have a favorite but stated that the drip over is stronger and the siphon is smoother and not as strong.  Ive never had my coffee siphoned so I opted for that, it was really smooth, didnt need milk/cream or sugar.  It was good!  Now comes the food.  We ordered their fried pork cutlet sandwich, it was really good comparable to the ones Ive had in Japan.  Also ordered the Omu-rice which is essentially seasoned rice covered in egg with some sauces.  This particular omu-rice had probably the best egg ive had in an omu rice.  The rice was fluffy as was the egg.  My only complaint is that they added a tad too much ketchup on top.  This place is pretty awesome, kind of wish it was bigger, probably seats 10-12ish.
Michelle C.}Los Angeles, CA}450}64}9}-1}3}3/31/2014}This place is really whatevers. First of all, I don't know why they wouldn't let us bring our coffee in the shop. Okay fine, this place is a coffee shop, but we already bought our coffee, you can't really expect us to throw it away now? I don't get what's the big deal. There was literally no one there, and the lady made a fuss about it.We ordered a parfait. Took 20 mins to make a fucking parfait. Okay fine the parfait was good and it looked pretty. BUT STILL. and it was like a $12 parfait.....
James L.}New York, NY}49}31}0}-1}1}3/28/2014}food was just blah, tonkatsu sandwich nothing special, egg sandwich was nasty i thought, pancakes are pancakes just like ihop but ihop is cheaper and gives u more...food came out at different times...wtf had to watch my beautiful date eat alone while i stared and watched...tap water gross...staff was very nazi like
Noa L.}New York, NY}6}61}12}-1}5}3/24/2014}I am IN LOVE with this place! I can't believe I lived right around the corner from it for so long and it took me until this week to discover. Since I did, I've been here 3 times! It's this super cute Japanese coffee shop (fits around 12) with amaaazing coffee and a few really yummy food items - serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. From the moment you walk in, the entire experience is very different... I've never seen coffee being brewed the way it is in Hi-Collar. The menu lists 3 different brewing methods (I recommend the Siphon) and a selection of coffee beans with different blends and strengths. I love the fact that you are able to see the entire process.... To top it off, they have a great friendly staff and extremely decent prices! Definitely my new coffee spot.
Michelle M.}Seattle, WA}252}98}113}-1}5}3/22/2014}Amazing and innovative coffee! We stumbled upon this place after having sushi next door and noticed the coffee being boiled in what almost looked like test tubes! This elegant Japanese cafe pours you individually brewed/air pressed coffee in delectable and adorable coffee tea cups. The coffee was amazing, the service (by the bar tender right in front of you) was on point, the food was small but tasty, and the location really does take you to another little piece of the world!
Stephanie T.}Manhattan, NY}3}36}3}-1}5}3/17/2014}My partner and I went a few months ago. We loved the atmosphere and food. My partner like the food so much he ordered two meals! The atmosphere is a cross between a hip bar and cozy diner. The food is comfort food. We ordered...Katsu Sandwich- The pork was crispy and juicy.  The not bread was soft but mushy or fall apart soft. It was a nice contract to the crunchy porkBeef noodle soup set-  I am not sure they have this anymore. It might have been a special. It was a simple soup of beef, noodles, and some veggies. The set also came with pickles and rice. It was a bit salty but overall good for a cold dayTamago Sandwich- This is the item we ordered because the first sandwich was so simple yet so good. This was equally amazing. I was really full but ate half the set. The eggs are fluffy and simply flavored. The soft bread went nicely with it. I don't drink coffee but I really like how they have drip coffee. Also I ordered a tea which came in a nice ceramic tea cup and spoon. It felt homey. All the items were really affordable 10 dollars and under.
Neal N.}Chatham, NJ}420}393}651}-1}5}3/16/2014}A small, real classy joint. They really pay attention to detail. We ended up here when the shabu shabu place nearby gave us a 90 minute wait. So glad things worked out the way they did!Well lit, with beautiful tissue paper flowers dangling from the ceiling. Gold bartop matches the gold in the bathroom. The bathroom which, by the way, has a sink bottom lined with smooth stones and a toilet with deodorizer and dryer functions!The bartender was well dressed and very polite. He let us try a few different types of sake before letting us choose which bottle. They had many different types to choose, from good to excellent quality, as well as different mouthfeels.For some reason we really got a kick out of the flowers in the ice bucket. Oh the little things that amuse us!We also tried the hot pot. Quality of beef was amazing! It was even better than the prime ribeye of the nearby shabu shabu place. Mostly onions, tofu and enoki mushrooms flavored the broth.All in all, this is a great little spot if you like a light, refined atmosphere and a good selection of sake.This place is also a coffee spot during the day. If it's anything like the sake bar service, then I'm definitely going back!
Keith P.}San Francisco, CA}6}217}1}-1}4}3/14/2014}almost 5 stars, but i didn't care for the pickles. the fish guts with daikon were salty and good. and the raw octopus with wasabi sauce was sublime. and salty. definitely a place to visit again.
Ben P.}New York, NY}3}15}0}-1}5}3/5/2014}I really love the feeling and cool look of this place. Don't expect to speed through, its the sort of place that you should go to when you just want to enjoy the Japanese atmosphere and unique coffee. I believe the owner also runs the noodle shop a few doors down.
Amy S.}Manhattan, NY}107}126}144}-1}4}2/10/2014}Came here with one of my best friends to just relax and enjoy brunch over some fancy gourmet coffee. The place is really small but very well maintained and adorable. The seating is only by the bar where you can watch them prepare your drinks. We came for brunch so we each ordered a coffee prepared in ways we've never had before. It was really cute and the coffee was delicious.I had a pork katsu sandwich what was cooked perfectly. My friend had the pasta of the day which was made of plum sauce with a generous pile of seaweed on top. There were notes of uni in the pasta, but maybe that was just us? We also shared the Japanese pancakes in the end.The service was a tad slow, but we didn't mind since we were in no rush. PS - the bathroom is beautiful - make sure you check it out.
Paul A.}New York, NY}241}395}450}18}5}2/7/2014}I came to this elegant little bar with my brother on the day of the Superbowl and absolutely every single person inside was speaking Japanese. The woman behind the counter carried on a soft conversation with a tired businessman while two young ladies that looked like they could have just stepped out of Ginza giggled over a story. Retro Japanese tunes played softly.Having been to Tokyo a few times, I can safely say this is the closest feeling I have ever experienced in NYC to being abroad in Japan. Beautiful decor, surprisingly authentic and traditional food (Umeboshi!!) and really excellent coffee. Sit back, order some siphon coffee (They have two varieties) and maybe a Katsu sandwich, and watch as they prepare your drink from a really stunning set of gold siphons. I think this is where the old Rai Rai Ken used to be and, now outfitted with cool Japanese screen doors and cherry blossom branches, I can safely say this is a pretty awesome next step.I almost didn't want to review this place because it is so chill and so small and I am worried it will be overwhelmed in the coming warmer months. But, whatever, that would just be selfish.  Anyway, enjoy Hi-Collar people, this one is definitely a keeper.
Mike T.}Manhattan, NY}0}9}1}-1}5}2/6/2014}Beautifully restrained interior. It's a small spot but you can tell that it's been designed with care. Makes me feel like I'm a character in one of Murakami's books in a quaint little Tokyo spot. The coffee was marvelous and watching it being prepared meticulously in front of me was a nice touch too. Had the katsu sandwich and the Japanese tapas dish. They were both fantastic. Made with so much care; simple but delicious!!
Alexa W.}Midtown East, Manhattan, NY}4}9}0}-1}4}2/1/2014}Came here for breakfast. Wonderful food for the price, the plating makes it even cuter and classier. The staff are very warm and helpful and make small talks with customers which is totally sweet! It's almost as if you are at a friend's place for breakfast. The only downside is the place is TINY. I'd say if you come as a group, a party of three is max. Will definitely come back to try out their lunch/dinner.
Kia H.}Brooklyn, NY}72}110}142}-1}4}1/30/2014}This is an amazing, tiny, gem in the east village. I enjoyed a great glass of nigori and the grilled sting ray.  The sting ray was nice. I was surprised that we got to grill it ourselves at the bar, a great shabu shabu pre game.The sake is great, the food is interesting and delicious, the ambiance is peaceful, and I hear the toilet is nice too...I will definitely visit again.Fyi: Hi-Collar is very small with a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Don't come here expecting party music and bar tricks, it's not that kind of place.
Carrie L.}Pittsburgh, PA}285}240}570}18}4}1/30/2014}Came here for dinner on a Friday night, and found out their popular coffee was sold out earlier in the day.  Hi-Collar is a narrow restaurant.  I'm even hesitant to call it a restaurant.  I should probably call it a sake bar with a few food items on the side.  The only seating they have available are the 10 bar spots.  The bartender/server was extremely friendly and helpful.  I am not a big sake drinker, so he gave me a mini tasting to help me choose.  Kizan sake is a sweet and sour sake.. and that was my favorite for the night.Their menu is handwritten, so I guess it changes almost daily.  As a tip to future goers, get tons of appetizers and don't get the entrees.  The appetizer section is where this place shines.  My friend and I got the chopped raw octopus with wasabi sauce and the grilled stingray fin to start.  We also got the entree with the berkshire pork katsu with miso cheese gratin.  The size portion at this place runs extremely small.  Despite that, we took our time to eat each dish.  The raw octopus with wasabi sauce was strange, with a decent wasabi kick at the end.  We liked it a lot though.  The grilled stingray fin was our favorite!!  I wish we got more.  We get to grill the stingray ourselves.. and the longer we left it there, the more crunchy it was.  Yummm!  The entree was typical but decent.  We were still a bit hungry after this meal, but given we were in St. Marks, there was a lot of after dinner snacks and desserts to be found.Overall:  Great service.  GREAT BATHROOM!  Excellent selection of sake if you are into that.  Delicious and atypical appetizers.
Gaetano S.}Avellino, Italy}1443}75}187}-1}5}1/19/2014}If you want to relax.. this is your place!!A real Japanese culture is here.. you choose your favourite blend of coffee (Tokyo black, I took the Holiday special !).They have great sandwiches (and also Japanese Tapas if you come before 3pm!).The service is amazing (always saying arigato!!!)
Laura R.}Manhattan, NY}9}22}5}-1}5}1/18/2014}Went for breakfast on a Saturday and the food, coffee, service,  and ambiance were great. Very cute spot. Few options for breakfast but the pancakes are filling and delicious. Presentation is beautiful.
Christine C.}New York, NY}21}50}0}-1}5}1/16/2014}Loved this place. Excellent food, service and most of all, coffee. I really appreciated that every single detail was well thought out -- the cups, syrup bottles, creamers, and decorations were all so beautiful, making the entire place that much more aesthetically pleasing. The servers are very nice and accommodating, and you can really tell by the way the food is presented that they really invest their time to bring out the best product possible. Everything seems so clean and classy -- it's a great place to bring someone you want to impress. As for what I had here, my roommates and I ordered the katsu sandwich, daily pasta and the omurice, and I got myself an iced coffee with soy milk. Everything was incredibly delicious and clean (not too greasy or buttery), but my favorite was the pasta. It was a Japanese-style pasta with a very sweet and tangy tomato-based sauce with bacon, green peppers and onion on spaghetti. I would highly recommend this, though Idk if they'll always have it (may have been a special). Would definitely come back, especially to try their desserts!
Deb L.}San Francisco, CA}85}97}40}-1}5}1/6/2014}Hole in the wall. Light Japanese breakfast was perfect.  Awesome coffee, coming from a coffee addict.  Ambience is very cute.  I have to comment on their bathroom, super fancy and came with a Japanese toilet (yeah - one of those!)
Mr. C.}San Francisco, CA}1}113}1}-1}4}1/5/2014}Darling of a place - a hole in the wall place but quaint and nice.   We just had siphon coffee and tea.  Service was pleasant  and amiable.  I need to go back to check out the other stuff.
Shirley Q.}Brooklyn, NY}85}22}3}-1}5}1/4/2014}Although this place only have bar seating, it has a nice cozy feeling. I ordered the hotcakes along with iced Japanese coffee. The hotcake is made when you order & it came out very fluffy and moist. It came with honey on the side for you to drizzle over it. As for the coffee, it is in a metal cup which keeps the the coffee in an icy temperature and syrup + milk is on the side for you to adjust to your taste. From what I see, people who come here to eat are very friendly. The owner, herself, is very friendly and interactive with customers. She will asks about your meal/your coffee just to make sure everything is good.
Sandra S.}Brooklyn, NY}178}495}269}18}5}12/30/2013}Excellent food and service here. As a person who has gone to Japan 5 times, I praise the food & drinks here as it is truly authentic! My sister and I were so happy to try the things here that we ordered to share: 1) Cold Brew Mizudashi Iced Coffee, 2) Katsu Sandwich w/ Today's Salad, 3) Tamago Sandwich w/ Today's Salad, and 4) Chocolate Parfait.The pork katsu sandwich (made with berkshire pork) was so delicious, and my most favorite. The katsu was crunchy, and full of flavor. The tamago sandwich (osaka-style egg omelet w/ cucumber sandwich) was also very tender, smooth & very tasty, but if you are not a fan of horse radish you may not like this. The mizudashi iced coffees were awesome (did taste like chocolate). And, the chocolate parfait (coffee jelly cubes, vanilla & chocolate ice cream & crunchy granola topped w/ whipped cream) was orgasmic!  Delicious!!!We both enjoyed our meals very much, and will be coming back here again. Gochisou-sama!*Tried their hot cakes, and man they are one of the best Japanese hot cakes I ever had! Truly delicious! The place is getting very popular, that the line seems to keep getting longer by the minute. But no matter the long lines, it is worth the wait! The food here is worth the wait.
H. N.}New York, NY}21}33}3}-1}5}12/27/2013}Hi-Collar is my fave spot for a coffee + lunch combo in the East Village. This quaint Japanese cafe/bar is a counter with a small number of stools only. If you are lucky enough to snag one of the seats, you are in for a treat. Their coffee menu offers an array of beans from around the world and from various roasters, including a roast of their own (Tokyo blend) via Porto Rico Importing Co. Coffee can be prepared iced or hot with different brewing options: aeropress, siphon, french press, and drip. It's all prepared well and tasty. As for food, you cannot go wrong with the pork katsu sandwich. It comes with a super delicious salad/sauce on the side, and they even cut off the crust on the bread for all you crust-haters. Their shokudou set is a good amount of food and well-balanced. Pasta of the day is usually great too - especially the spaghetti with roe sauce, which is as amazing as you'd expect. At night, Hi-Collar turns into a bar with a chill vibe and large variety of sakes. The folks working here are cool, friendly, and not pretentious. Don't expect to get coffee or food quickly after ordering though... perfection takes time :)
Ichigo C.}Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY}21}13}9}-1}5}12/6/2013}My best friend brought me here the other day and I fell in love with the store!The store's atmosphere is the best~ It's incredibly small so there's only bar seating but I think that adds to the atmosphere! Their coffee filters are super retro and the decor behind the bar is really cool! The store has coat hangers behind the seats which is a huge plus for me since my coats are extremely heavy and inconvenient (especially in the winter)!I've only tried the Omurice but I'll definitely be back to try everything else on their menu!
J-Ha a.}San Francisco, CA}43}26}74}-1}5}12/5/2013}The pancakes were delicious! Each pancake is about 3/4 inch thick and very fluffy. The marmalade butter was a highlight.
Irene K.}New York, NY}80}16}31}-1}5}11/24/2013}A small and cozy bar where they have a variety of rice wine. The ambiance was nice with jazz music and good for small group of 2-3 friends to hang out.  We came in to grab a drink while waiting for our table for the next door restaurant. They have some Japanese bar snacks for you to choose from to go with the drinks. If you are up for adventurous food, takowasa (wasabi marinated raw octopus) is pretty good with rice wine!
Merideth G.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}11/23/2013}Sake bar at night and coffee shop/cafe during the day.  Had the sake experience at night and this was really relaxing and intimate.  There is only one bar table that fits like 10 people.  My favorite was the coffee infused sake.  My BF had the Gentlemen's Sake bomb, which was essentially a beer with ice made from sake.  A bit pricey though but a place worth going to at least once.
Allan D.}New York, NY}520}40}1}-1}4}11/18/2013}The coffee is pretty damn good. Hand drip coffee for 2.50. My only issue with this place is that it's 2.50 for a small coffee. sigh. I think it's good if you don't care how much you spend on coffee but I won't be frequenting this place.
April Joy C.}Brooklyn, NY}359}69}161}-1}5}10/21/2013}This place makes me happy.  I wish I could just leave my review at that but that doesn't really say much.  Been here twice.  The first time was for brunch the second for drinks and a little snack.Brunch here was perfect.  They take the art of making coffee very seriously and though I'm no coffee connoisseur, I can appreciate a good cup of java just like the rest of them.  The tamago sando here is unlike any egg sandwich I've ever had.  Not sure what magical hen lays these eggs to create such a soft fluffy creamy omelette but if meat ain't your thing, this is definitely the way to go.  Now if you're a carnivore, as other posts have mentioned, the katsu sando is the way to go.  Not oily and not soggy, the sandwich is just perfect.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but there's definitely an art to how these sandwiches are made so precise and symmetrical. Also, they have what I consider Japanese style parfaits.  Granola and ice cream and coffee jello/jelly.  Each bite is heaven to me. Not too sweet but just sweet enough.Around 7 o'clock, the place reopens up and turns into a sake bar.  The sake selection is great.  Takashi, who works there knows what he's talking about and can recommend a sake to your liking.  Though the beer selection is limited, they have hard to find beers on the menu and they're definitely worth a taste.  Had a yuzu type beer these evening and it was great. The place isn't overly crowded (yet, I have a feeling when word gets out this place will be just as hard to get a seat at) and the atmosphere is cool but not pretentious.  If you're ever in the area after work, I recommend grabbing a seat, ordering one of the sakes or beer, and enjoying the fact that you made it this far into the day.
Harumi U.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}44}134}1815}-1}4}10/21/2013}Just opened in June and their business has been doing just fine!  Hi-collar in Japanese was used, although there is no direct translation, "fashionable" "trendy" or something like that in the past.  Hi-Collar definitely offers that feel - high "fashion" in retro sense.Baristas are very knowledgeable and friendly. While I was there, the barista who served us was from west side of Japan which made our conversation even more fun!Usual method of drinking coffee is either pour over or espresso (or variation of them), right?  This shop has a very unique method of making coffee - Those who are interested, you should visit the shop yourself to find out.  They make their iced coffee mizudashi style (cold brew) which is fantastic.  They are also very selective about the beans they use - they may have only 5, but these 5 really do the trick.I am giving this place 4 stars only because I only had coffee.  However, this is a place that serves Japanese kissaten style food (if you have been to Hiroko's Place, the kind of food you find are similar) which is always a joy.
Minnie R.}New York, NY}38}38}17}-1}4}10/12/2013}Laid back and charming coffee parlor in the daytime; sake bar in the evenings. Good selections, pleasant service, neighborhood gem. What's not to like?
Trixie L.}Wayne, NJ}17}16}73}-1}5}10/11/2013}Glad I paid this place a visit before it gets bombarded by tons of people eager to have a taste of Hi-Collar.I absolutely loved the atmosphere from the moment I went in. It's pretty small with very limited seating. But it feels cozy and intimate so I can't really complain. Most of the patrons when I arrived were Japanese, speaking their native tongue with the female bartender. (Felt absolutely ashamed of my broken Nihonggo lol)I ordered the Kissaten-style daily pasta and the server informed me that they had Cod roe spaghetti with enoki that day. I was so happy because I've been craving some lately and the dish did not disappoint. It was creamy and the mushrooms were a perfect touch! This dish is topped off with nori strips. I also got a katsu sandwich to go since everyone's raving about it. And they're right to rave! It was delish! The dip tasted like really smooth egg salad plus a magical ingredient (I don't know what) but normal egg salad doesn't taste as good as that. Just a note, they don't cut off the fat portion of the katsu so if you don't like that, make sure you don't bite into it. And they also slice the crust off, no complaints there!Apart from that I got the Mizudashi iced coffee which I overloaded with simple syrup and milk because I like my coffee sweet. That was also good. And Ms. A got the tamago sandwich which she reported was fluffy and tasted amazing.My overall food experience was pretty great and I would really love to come back to try their other stuff like desserts (or just order the same things!). Service was good and the bartender was friendly (there was only one). Perfect for a daytime date or if you're looking for some cozy alone time with good food.
Mike Y.}Brooklyn, NY}71}190}62}-1}4}10/7/2013}Hi-collar is a very cute coffee bar(and from what i understand at night, an alcohol bar) in the east village located on e. 10th between 2nd and 3rd.It has a long gold bar which seats about 10-15. It is clad in wood and japanese-style paneling. There are little japanese match books that dot the top of ledge above the back counter. The place was manned by two cute japanese ladies.We came on a saturday afternoon around 1-ish and was able to seat immediately. We were in a bit of a rush but needed to grab a bite to eat. Ordered the katsu sandwich and the omu rice. Also got the mizudashi iced-coffee.The katsu sandwich was very plain but also quite delicious. The pork katsu was fried and came between two slices of white bread with a remoulade on the side. The omu-rice, or omelet rice was also pretty good. it is a fluffy omelette on top of a mound of rice mixed with fatty pork and ketchup. a sausage octopus and a piece of garnish sits next to it. the fatty pork was unexpected and...well...actually not my favorite, it tasted a little bit undercooked. i love ketchup so ketchup drenched rice is good with me. overall, not a bad dish for $9 but i can see others being squeamish.the mizudashi coffee came in a little metal cup with a handle. i think metal cups are a bit of a novelty but presentation wise, it was cute and the coffee was good. smooth and not acidic. i drank it straight no sugar no milk. gf who isnt a hard core coffee drinker thought it a bit bitter. i didnt see an espresso machine anywhere so thought that was a bit funny to be missing at a coffee bar.all the parfaits looked delicious but by the end of our meal we were too stuffed to handle it. i think we made it in and out in an hour. longest part was waiting on the food as it took about 20 minutes for them to prepare the katsu sandwich and the omu rice, which i guess is acceptable.cute place. good for a lunch date. limited seating. great friendly service. definitely a place to come back to for me.
Janna A.}Fairview Slopes, Vancouver, Canada}3}1}0}-1}5}10/2/2013}Everything about this space, both as a coffee bar and a sake bar, was spectacular. I wish I lived in NYC so I could visit every day.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}4}9/25/2013Updatedreview}I gave 4 for my first eat-in experience but I could skip Shokudou lunch set (see photo)- Shokudou set -The homemade Yuzu dressing on the salad was refreshing, crispy and delicious. Miso soup was packed with tofu cubes and satisfying but the deconstructed Sukiyaki, main dish, didn't wow me compare to other items, Katsu-sando and Eggu-sando. If I want a set (Teishoku), I go to Ippudo.- Must dish -We were both absolutely blown away by their pancake, outer texture of the cake is nutty-crunchy-sweet and inside is fluffy soft. It was sick! It wasn't rich as Castella, a Japanese egg cake, introduced by Portuguese in 16th Century, but it was delicious. Two big guys in a restaurant, restaurant business-types, were cute. They were sharing one Chocolate Parfait. I understood why those big boys were sharing only one, it was packed and high with all the goodness. What came next was the pancake for each.- Entertainment -Chatty and charming Yuko(?) talks fast and with her Osaka dialect, Kansai-ben. The famous comedians are mostly from Osaka, She was entertaining. She is the one closer to the entrance, and Chika is the one, mostly, in the kitchen. -Other items I want to try -There were other nostalgic items like Omurice and Kissaten-style spaghetti, with a sweet tomato sauce.- About - Hi-Collar is a new creation of Mr. Shuji B. Yagi who is a founder and president of the T.I.C. Group. The company operates Soba-ya, Robataya, Cha-an, Hasak, Curry-ya and two restaurants next to HC (Rairaiken and Shabu-Tatsu) and more. Including Midtown restaurant, Sakagura and recently opened in May this year, Kiosku, Deli/ Bodega is a nice addition to Mr. Yagi owns 11 creations in the city. They are my favorite places to go except, Otafuku (old location). Their Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki are okay. Sweet things like Taiyaki and Daifuku mochi are better.  tic-nyc.com/pages/restau…
Nhu T.}New York, NY}77}70}162}-1}4}9/9/2013}Nice ambiance to enjoy sake and catch up with a friend. Great service. Great sake selection and the sake glass was really nice and classy. Will check out their morning/lunch scene soon. P.S. love the bathroom
LV C.}New York, NY}7}198}0}-1}5}8/25/2013}Great service, great food, impeccably clean space.1) Omurice-- good2) Osaka style omelet with cucumbers sandwich-- good3) Hotcakes with orange marmalade butter-- good4) Cold brew mizudashi iced coffee-- good5) Siphon coffee-- very good
Caitlin R.}Brooklyn, NY}14}58}3}-1}4}8/18/2013}Very neat, it's exactly like a coffee shop in Japan. Atmosphere is wonderful, coffee is really good. Coffee shop during the day, sake bar during the night. I'd love to check out the night scene. Keep it up!
m c.}Manhattan, NY}1}22}3}-1}5}8/10/2013}Absolutely the best coffee in the neighborhood! Quality sake served with a passion! The presentation, professionalism and product have a common theme - consistency.Its not easy to successfully function as a dual use space, but Hi-Collar seamlessly manages to transform via what I call a metamorphosis - from a unique coffee house by day into an exceptional sake bar at night.  Its become a daily routine and always a pleasurable experience.
Brian L.}New York, NY}3}32}21}-1}5}7/31/2013}Such a great place. Very simple food but done correctly. It's incredibly small but no doubt will soon grow in popularity and that small interior will be full all the time which I look forward to for the owners.When I went my first time it was for breakfast and I was the only one there which was nice as I got to relax with the great relaxing music they play. It's one long bar with about 15 stools or so on a copper colored bar. In the morning and afternoon it's breakfast/lunch service and at night, they slide back a door on the wall to shutter the coffees and teas and reveal the sakes.For breakfast I got the Deluxe Morning Setto which included buttered toast, hard boiled egg, sausage and I received watermelon with balsamic drizzled over it. Simple, something you can make at home sure, but damn it's executed perfectly. I think the fruit element varies from day to day depending on what they have. Also got their Cold Brew "Mizudashi" Iced Coffee. Presentation alone was great, but the taste; almost "chocolately" and truly a great cup of coffee. Later that day, went back for some lunch because why not!? Lunch I bought both the Katsu sandwich and the Tamago Egg Sandwich to go. Their presentation in the "to-go packages" is even done with care! Garnish and everything. The Katsu sandwich on the traditional white bread with no crust was great. Comes with what I believe is Japanese Tartar sauce which is made from hard boiled eggs. Think, creamy egg salad dipping sauce. (If you've ever eaten at Ichibantei on 13th Street and eaten their Chicken Nanban, the tartar sauce they put on that is the same.) Perfect, not oily whatsoever, and dipping the sandwich into that sauce results in a very happy individual. The Tamago Egg sandwich caught me by surprise. This is not your average egg sandwich from a deli or from a Japanese deli for that matter. One of the creamiest egg omelettes I've eaten and is also served on the crustless white bread and thinly sliced cucumber. There is also a very minimal heat element that I believe to be horseradish-based. It's certainly not overwhelming and is just barely present but is there and very appreciated as it takes the sandwich to the next level. My breakfast before tip cost me a whopping $8. My lunch cost me a even bigger, whopping $14. I don't know of a place that I've visited ever, that has given me the same amount of pleasure of consuming their food, at that price point, ever. It's insanely affordable. Be aware, their to go menu is limited, and their credit card minimum is $10.The service is very friendly, the food comes out relatively quick when taking into account the size of the place and kitchen, and the food is great. Their bathroom is one of the cleanest and nicest bathrooms I've seen too and they feature a "Toto" Japanese toilet. (Their bathroom is the bathroom I want in my apartment in the future. I want it.)
Jonathan N.}Manhattan, NY}150}97}149}-1}5}7/16/2013}I'm going to be so sad when this place gets really popular and it's impossible to get a seat here. This place is the best. I came here during the day for some coffee. Although the food menu is a little limited, the place makes up for it in quality. I tried the Mizudashi iced coffee, which was very good. I want to try their air-pressed coffee sometime. The food looks relatively good and affordable. The lunch menu is a little larger and at night they only serve "snacks" rather than full dinner entrees. Therefore, this is a great place to go after dinner if you want a nice place to chill.Hi-Collar is a little small; it only serves around 12-14 people at a time. They also do not take reservations, so try to come in at an odd hour. The service is phenomenal. At night, when Hi-collar turns into a sake bar, the bartenders are very helpful. They really teach you about the different types of sake and they help you pick out a sake that fits your taste. I would recommend the Dai Ginjo section. It is a bit stronger than the other sakes. These sakes have at least 50% of the rice polished away with some added alcohol. The drinks may seem a little pricey but they give a large serving of sake. They have a large selection of Japanese beers as well but they get very popular so they run out more quickly. Seriously though. Go to Hi-Collar.
Dana C.}Arcadia, CA}13}15}8}-1}5}7/7/2013}It's easy to miss this place as you're walking by since the place is so small. There's only one bar with around 10-12 stools I think? Hi-Collar feels really classy but is totally affordable. My friend and I came here at around 12 pm on a Sunday and the place was completely empty. More people came in to eat at around 1:30 pm. The food and coffee menus are a bit limited but that just makes choosing what to order easier. I had the Mizudashi iced coffee and the Katsu Sandwich. I'm pretty sure the Mizudashi iced coffee is my favorite iced coffee so far. I added half&half and some sugar syrup but the coffee overall was sweet and refreshing. As the description says, it had a deep flavor without bitterness or acidity. The Katsu sandwich was great and came with a small scoop of egg salad. The pork wasn't too dry and the tangy sauce and pepper had a good balance of flavor.My friend got the Shokudou Lunch Set and they even gave us an extra bowl of miso soup so I could try some. The set included miso soup with enokitake mushrooms, a sour plum, a dish of seaweed and ginger (not sure since I didn't try it but my friend said it was sour), and the main dish which has beef, egg, and tofu. The main dish was delicious but a tad salty so definitely eat it with rice. We were also given a small dish of canned oranges and peaches with cream.My friend and I were surprisingly very full after our meal but we still had some room for dessert. We shared the seasonal fruit parfait which had mango and cantaloupe with vanilla ice cream and pound cake. It was very refreshing but not overly sweet.Overall, I'll definitely be back to try more of the coffee and lunch items. I'm in love with the overall laid-back atmosphere and the classy decor. Also definitely coming back at night to try the bar. We took a look at the drinks menu and most of it was just romanized Japanese. On top of the menu they wrote that they did that on purpose to encourage conversation with the bartender (which I thought was pretty cool of them to do).
Michelle T.}New York, NY}319}971}1072}18}5}7/3/2013}We came here on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and everything was amazing. The service was attentive and friendly. The staff, although few, are very efficient and polite. The entire restaurant is only one long bar with bar stools, which is amazing because you get to see all the action. There was a very intimate and laid-back vibe. The decor was also super classy and really complemented the jazzy vibe. We had the Shokudou Lunch Set with Japanese Tapas and the Pork Katsu Sandwich and both were super delicious. The Shokudou is probably your best deal since you get a good amount of food for just $13.00. But my two favorites was the Hawaiian Maui Coffee, which was very fragrant and rich, and the Hot Cakes, which were one of the fluffiest pancakes I have ever eaten.
William P.}Elmhurst, NY}100}107}49}-1}5}6/30/2013}A friend of mine suggested I visit this sake bar after its recent opening. I decided last night would be a good time to try it, so me and another friend went to check it out. Originally my intent was to sample a few of the sakes on offer, but was pleasantly surprised by the beer selection and decided I would try one of these first. Hi collar is a classy place, but easy on the wallet, I found pricing to be reasonable. We tried the Yonayona Ale and an IPA, both really tasty. One of the things I particulary liked is that beer is served in chilled brass cups which serves the duel purpose of keeping your beer chilled and making you look cool. I would imagine its a similar feeling drinking out of a goblet of some sort, but I can't remember having ever done that. After the beer we sampled an unfiltered sake which was surprisingly smooth. When you order a glass, your sake comes in a small carafe, and they give you two shot glasses. Of course this is typical and great for sharing. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to selection. Though I didn't sample the food, it looks really good, authentic Japanese dishes. The bar tender also told me that the space doubles as a coffee shop during the day which I thought was a clever idea and use of the space. Definitely worth checking out for a drink in a laid back quite atmosphere. Also a great place for a date.
Yifen J.}Kyoto, Japan}318}356}163}18}5}6/21/2013}Classy, friendly, intimate. This understated cafe/bar sits next to Curry-ya on 10th.   As you enter, the dim interior with rich colors transports you out of New York.  Take some time to admire the glasses and kitchenware behind the bar- real beautiful pieces.They have an extensive sake list, with experienced staff who are so pleasant and willing to chat with you.  It's a top notch, classy bar, without being pretentious.  Definitely make sure to ask for the sake and food special of the day.  I had beef with uni and cod roe (and something else?);  even though it was a small portion, the dish was well rounded, rich, satisfying.  Would definitely come back to try more sake, and just relax.I'd recommend trying to get here early, as it is a small space. A great place to start the night, or have good conversation.  Note:: I think they're closed on Tuesdays, so, just fyi.
Cynthia O.}New York, NY}339}241}122}-1}4}6/18/2013}Nice cute little coffee shop with nice ice coffee! The decor is quite nice and what the east village needs on this block!
William C.}Los Angeles, CA}309}107}5}-1}5}6/15/2013}The staff here consists of some of the friendliest and sweetest people in the business. Based merely on the service, Hi-Collar deserves 10/5 stars. We had a Chocolate Parfait, which had gelato, granola, whipped cream, coffee jelly, bananas, and surprisingly, orange peels (which complimented everything else in the parfait perfectly). I would highly recommend getting this because it's a delicious swirl of chocolatey goodness that isn't too overpowering. The restaurant ambience is pleasant and fitting for its high quality and service.

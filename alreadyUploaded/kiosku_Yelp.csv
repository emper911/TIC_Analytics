Valerie C.}New York, NY}306}705}209}18}4}3/8/2018}The BESTTTT and unique Japanese snacks at excellent prices.The coffee from Hi-Collar is mediocre, and the cashier is definitely not the friendliest. Come here for the snack selection and prepared to be amazed!!!
John A.}United Kingdom}0}14}29}-1}1}10/4/2017}A woman who works there as a cashier is terrible, bad service. Obviously she is Japanese, i have never seen a Japanese female with such a poor attitude. The launch boxes and snacks selling are nice, but Â i will never visit again, just because her poor, terrible attitude.

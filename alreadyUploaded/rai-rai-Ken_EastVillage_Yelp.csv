Tiffany C.}New York, NY}122}78}231}18}4}5/2/2018}Everytime we babysit our nephews we always come here for lunch. We tend to get the lunch special, appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert. My nephew who doesn't like to eat anything almost kills the entire pork friend rice. It is definitely very good and packed with flavor. The ramen is better than the average ramen spots but not the best we had. I tend to get the Shoyu ramen which is solid, sometimes I'll get it with wontons but note that the wondons are extremely small and flat, not much filling but that's how I like it so I'm fine with it. My fiance loves the Tan Tan Men, very rich and creamy. As for appetizers, Kara Age fried chicken is really good but it is dark meat so it can be very fatty. The shisito peppers are always fantastic. The pork belly sandwich is ok not very authentic. The dessert is mochi ice cream which is just frozen out of a box. This place does get extremely crowded at times but nonetheless very solid ramen!
YS H.}Santa Monica, CA}258}26}0}-1}1}4/28/2018Updatedreview}This time, I brought two of my good friends from Germany. Food was as good as ever. But the server who handled our check was no good. First, she did not follow our request to divide the check into three, and take cash for two of us, and charge the exact amount we specified to my credit card. She had to take everything back to cancel the transaction. Then in the second time, she came up with a CC charge slip that had more than what we specified (we included tip in it, of course). This destroyed our otherwise enjoyable experience. I am not sure I want to go back anymore. She was new to me in this place, so next time, she will be gone.Now I understand what she did. Instead of dividing the total to three, she divided it to two (after taking cash for two of us). It is an IQ issue or what? Totally disgusting.
Brian P.}San Francisco, CA}179}32}15}-1}5}4/21/2018}Delish ramen and super fast service.   Doing the combo special is the best way to go.   There were other people there and the cook seemed really busy, but that didn't slow him down.  Seemed like moments after we ordered our food it arrived!
Wayne M.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}4/19/2018}I've been dining at Rai Rai Ken for more than a decade. It's one of my favorite East Village spots. I always order the same thing. Shoyu Ramen. It's generally a big hearty bowl of soup and usually does the trick. But when I came in tonight, I noticed the portion was considerably smaller. I'm not talking about a little bit smaller -- it was like a half size portion of noodles. And the pork was paper thin. Now mind you, I know this bowl of soup like the back of my hand. Have had it dozens and dozens of times. And I'm not a big eater. I'm not all about big portions generally. But when I said something to the waitress about it she said it was impossible, that they premeasure the portions. But that doesn't mean that the pre-measurement is not significantly smaller all of a sudden. With so many other noodle shops springing up all over the village it's a shame that this one has decided to suddenly cut corners in such a noticeable ways. It is after all a $20 bowl of noodles! It's such a shame, but I may not be back here. At least not for a while.
J K.}Richmond Hill, NY}0}7}0}-1}5}4/17/2018}I am in love with Rai Rai Ken. The staff are always friendly, they have beer on tap and the ramen tastes great. I have a stamp card that is almost full. This place gets filled quickly, but people eat and leave so it doesn't become overcrowded. This is my go to place for ramen. The gyoza is ok in my opinion, but my girlfriend loves it.
Michele H.}Stony Point, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}4/14/2018}Delicious! That's all I have to say. My family and I ordered 4 different kinds of ramen dishes and we enjoyed them all! Apps were yummy too!
Rachel K.}Los Angeles, CA}393}8}25}-1}3}4/11/2018}Got this as take-out. The broth was just average--salty but not too many layers of flavor. It does have a decent chicken broth option for my friend who refuses to eat red meat or anything red meat related. It's not bad by any means but when there are so many good options in East Village for ramen, Rai Rai Ken just kind of pales in comparison.
Eric A.}Manhattan, NY}72}2}0}-1}5}4/4/2018}Ate hear with my in-law with wife and daughter cozy spot friendly staff reasonable prices ..
Bryan C.}Westbury, NY}16}2}0}-1}2}4/3/2018}Broth is bland default at best and generic tasting pork. Came on my birthday expecting momofuku down the street unfortunately it was way to full so we ended up heading to rai rai ken witch was recommended by a local we randomly met on the street. Turns out we made a big mistake honestly I feel sad ramen is always such a great pick up after a long day work and to have eaten here soured the day would only recommend the pork buns they drench em in bbq sauce otherwise take the blue pill and stay away from this slop.
Cheryl C.}New York, NY}214}76}193}18}5}4/1/2018}Rushing off to the movies, we stopped by to grab a few orders of pork buns. For a quick snack it was soo filling and yummy.  I think we would have ordered more if we had more time, I think we had about 15-30 min to get to the theatre.  I would definitely come by here again, and since I'm by the area so often will do so on the next chilly day.
Brosia R.}Pleasanton, CA}271}10}0}-1}5}3/26/2018}I just want to defend the Tan Tan Men, I really enjoyed mine. The chicken AND pork broth has a soft flavor, and the sesame is noticeable but not overpowering, giving the broth a silky texture when the egg yolk starts to mix in. I added a little spice to it and was very pleased. My partner got the Mabo ramen and he said he'd wished he'd ordered the Tan Tan, only because he liked it a little more after he tasted mine. Don't let cheap people's cheap opinions sway your decision to try it!
Chris R.}New York, NY}3}26}0}-1}4}3/25/2018}Have ordered delivery and ate in as well. It's a small space so be prepared to wait. It'll be worth it. The pork buns are spectacular. The quality of the ramen isn't lost on the delivery. They break it up so it travels well.  You have a few different options with the base and can add ingredients.  I like this spot.
Christine B.}Queens, NY}78}181}270}18}3}3/17/2018}Got the dinner set for $19.75I got the kara-age, tan tan men, ginger ale and green tea mochi.The fried chicken with aoli was very crispy and good. The tan tan men ramen was not good. Chicken broth and ground chicken in ramen is not a good combo. It was actually gross. It should've been a little spicy but it was still bland. I added more spices to it but it didn't help.
Danielle C.}New York, NY}2}9}3}-1}3}3/7/2018}Ended up here after my original dinner plans fell through and was not disappointed.Ordered the veggie gyoza, shoyu wonton ramen and miso ramen. For dessert we got the red bean and green tea mochi (ate it before I could even think about taking a picture) and it was a nice end to the meal. Overall happy with my experience here and will come back to try the other ramen (especially since they have a frequent shopper rewards card and who doesn't love free ramen?).
Keays C.}New York, NY}427}35}23}18}3}1/28/2018}Decent ramen in the EV but definitely was lacking the flavor that momofuku and ipuddo have. I got the Shoyu ramen with extra spinach no pork, perhaps the meat would have added the flavor I was looking for. The service was great and the prices are awesome ($11 for ramen). If you are looking for a less expensive ramen option it is worth trying for yourself.
Natalie N.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}1/23/2018}Best pork buns and ramen! I'm a regular, and outside of the food, the service is also 5-stars every single time.
Melody C.}Brooklyn, NY}12}82}155}18}3}1/15/2018}Extremely mediocre food. Came here on Christmas eve because hi-collar a few doors down wasn't serving entree food that night. Good thing the ramen wasn't that pricey or else it would've been totally not worth it! Presentation was a bit lacking. Got the pork buns for appetizer and it is the worst that I've ever had. I think a very simple but efficient solution would be to add more sauce inside! I've never seen such little sauce for these buns before...The ramen was very meh too. The soup base tasted like boiling chicken in a pot of water and then using that water as the soup base. And no it doesn't taste like chicken broth. That might've been better than what we got. Would've preferred cooking instant ramen myself over that. However parking was easy to find on the block and our waiter was observant and welcoming.
Nadine G.}Brooklyn, NY}52}51}1}-1}2}1/14/2018}This place used to have good ramen. My post is too short for yelp so I'm just going to say it again. Thus place used to have good ramen.
Hayley C.}Portland, OR}77}2}0}-1}1}12/15/2017}Just paid $30 for a bowl of ramen to be delivered. Had to throw it in the bin it was disgusting
A S.}Manhattan, NY}82}5}1}-1}1}12/10/2017}Miso Ramen had only a few pieces of chicken. It was extremely disappointing.  The have gluten-free noodles so if that's your thing you might want to try it. if you want any protein or a true helping of vegetables with your meal, do not go there.
Karyn E.}Bronx, NY}236}4}0}-1}3}12/5/2017}It was okay. The broth was thin and the flavor lacking. If you love ramen and are familiar with really good ramen spots, you would not be happy with Rai Rai Ken. We got gyozas because it was on their happy hour special and we all loved them. The sauce was good. I went here because I received a google notification it was featured on Absolutely Best Places to Eat Ramen Maybe they forgot the word "not" before eat.
Reina C.}Los Angeles, CA}81}34}23}-1}2}12/3/2017}Their gyoza is tasty ($6) and it's great that they offer them for $4 during happy hour. The tonkotsu doesn't taste like a pork broth; it tastes more like fish. So I don't recommend ordering the dipping ramen. I don't think this place is authentic, just try a different ramen place.
Rachel G.}Hyde Park, NY}107}31}19}-1}3}11/29/2017}Was  craving Ramen and made the mistake of going here.... :( broth was super thin and did not really have any flavor but I think the other food is decent because I saw people enjoying some rice dishes if you want solid Ramen this is not the place. They should not advertise it as a Ramen place.
Zev L.}New York, NY}165}94}36}18}3}11/28/2017}I had never been to Rai Rai Ken before, but after a night of drinking with some friends we searched for some ramen! We searched all of the typical city spots in lower manhattan, but they were packed and so we stumbled over to Rai Rai Ken to give it a shot.I ultimately decided to not go with Ramen, and had a bowl of of mapo tofu curry with minced pork. It was not a bad meal by any means, but did not blow my mind away. It was something that was tasty, but not convinced that I would get it again on another visit. I was able to order a char siu on the side, but it was served cold, and so the flavor was dulled by that.As a side note - RRK has the BEST bathroom i've ever gotten to use. Its's very Japanese with a bidet :) enjoy.
Sam S.}New York, NY}229}47}6}18}3}11/28/2017}I came here on a Monday with a friend who had never had ramen before. I figured I would try this place, as it had cheap beer deals and affordable ramen bowls. I got the Tan Tan Men, and he got the Curry Ramen. The Tan Tan Men was good, nothing special, but the bok choy was the star of the dish (not complaining). My friend did not really like his Curry Ramen, as he said the curry flavor overwhelmed the dish rather than adding to the dish. The beer was fine, but the menu for drinks is very small. All in all, the place was decidely average. Did I enjoy my meal? Yeah. Would I come back again? Probably not, considering the wealth of ramen restaurants in East Village.
Karen K.}San Francisco, CA}190}71}462}-1}5}11/22/2017}Wow, this was the best bowl of chuka soba (classic shoyu ramen) that I've had in a while. The soup is done really well, so well that I thought I was eating at my favorite ramen shop in Japan for a moment. It is balanced--not just salty, not too oily, and has some mysteriously delicious dimensions to it. The wonton was also tasty; the skin was soft and thin and the filling fresh and flavorful. The noodles were done just as I requested. I was very satisfied with my bowl of wonton shoyu ramen.
Allie B.}Brooklyn, NY}248}96}66}18}4}11/20/2017}My friend and I had not originally planned on eating at Rai Rai Ken, but the inside looked warm and inviting. This restaurant has gluten-free noodles which was an added bonus as my friend is allergic to gluten and was worried she would not be able to eat it. I also tried the rice noodle substitute and it was a lighter alternative to the traditional ramen noodle. The serving size was average so we left full without feeling heavy. If you are in the area definitely consider this spot !
H C.}San Francisco, CA}158}7}0}-1}1}11/9/2017}Worst bowl of ramen I've ever had in my life, with terrible and rude service to boot. Don't waste your time at this place. Thankfully there are lots of other options for Japanese food in this area.
Shar H.}New York, NY}43}115}9}-1}5}11/2/2017}I was starving around 11 pm yesterday evening and the only thing I could find open was Rai Rai Ken.  Lucky for me that they do takeout as well.  I ordered a bowl of their vegetarian miso ramen.  The waitress who took my order was polite and quickly got my order in (even though they were about to close).  They packaged it up really nicely as well -- with the noodles and veggies (which were cold) placed into a plastic bowl with a lid and the miso broth in a separate container.  When I came home and put the ramen and veggies (broccoli, corn, seaweed, carrots, snow peas, scallions and dried garlic) into a bowl and poured the very hot broth over it, I had an awesome meal!  They don't put MSG in the broth either and that's obvious from the taste -- it's all miso goodness.  Very economical for what I got -- it was $12.  Going back there again!
Peggy W.}New York, NY}481}166}150}18}3}10/27/2017}Good enough, but not great. I got the dinner set for ~$20, which came with your choice of an appetizer, ramen and desserts from their list. If you do the math, you're pretty much only getting a free dessert, so I would probably pass on this. I liked the ramen, but there are so many ramen shops in New York that are better. The broth was lacking a bit - it seemed kind of watered down, which is a big no no for me when it comes to ramen. There's also generally such great Asian food in the area that I would rather go somewhere else for noodles or ramen. Karage (fried chicken) is another benchmark item I use for comparing ramen shops, and it was not good. It was neither crispy nor flavorful - major letdown. The service was good, and it's easy to flag down an employee because of the size of the shop.
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}2}10/14/2017}Did not enjoy my noodles...had ammonia smell in it. 2 stars because my husband did not mind it and service was okay.
Carl H.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}2}10/9/2017}Delivered near cold and tasteless ramen noodles. Worst place I ever ordered and would not do it again!!
David K.}Brooklyn, NY}2}17}0}-1}5}9/30/2017}This place was my introduction to ramen. I've only ever had the chicken miso ramen, and it's so good every single time. It was more fun to eat here in their old, smaller location, but the newer location still makes good ramen.
Lolin L.}Brooklyn, NY}3}111}110}18}3}9/23/2017}This place didn't have as long as a wait on a Friday night like all the neighboring restaurants so we decided to give this place a try. It wasn't bad, but I've also had better. We had the karage, shoyu wonton ramen, and miso ramen. The broths itself weren't too salty.. but for some reason when you take a bite with ramen it becomes salty. They do offer a no msg gluten free ramen for an extra $2 maybe this option would be not as salty as a lot of yelpers have complained? I do like that they serve the thicker ramen as oppose to the thin one a lot of places serve.The service was fine, they were quick, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come have ramen here.
Dylan T.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}4}9/17/2017}Nice hole-in-the-wall ramen place. Service is fast and ramen isn't too salty. It's pretty good for weekday lunches, but they charge $15 for ramen on weekends, which we didnt notice on the menu until the bill came.
Raquel T.}Manhattan, NY}124}2}4}-1}5}9/7/2017}I was recommended this place by a friend and boy did they not disappoint. I chose their dinner special which includes one drink, one app, one entree, and a mochi for $19.75, which runs from 6pm-10pm. The Food was amazing and speedy, and the service was genuinely friendly. All in all this will not be my last trip, A+ service.
Christine F.}New York, NY}2}29}0}-1}2}8/21/2017}I came here a while back, and there was a fly in my sauce. It didn't bother me too much because it's a restaurant, so bugs happen I guess. However, the ramen was very mediocre and it only came with one piece of pork lol (?). The seafood soup base also tasted nothing like seafood to me. Staff was polite enough, but since we are in Manhattan with a dozen other places, it is unlikely I will revisit Rai Rai Ken.
Christine G.}Brooklyn, NY}168}26}2}-1}5}7/30/2017}A pretty solid ramen place with great meal set deals! It is very clean, comfortable, and cozy inside. The menu is organized in a way where it is easy to quickly decide and choose what food you want to order. Their ramen is delicious and their side dishes are also delicious as well. This is one of the few restaurants in New York City that I do not mind going repeatedly again.
Tom C.}New York, NY}102}216}291}18}3}7/30/2017}Not the best but decent affordable ramen. Shoyu, miso, curry and veggie base; they also have tsukemen and cold ramen during the warmer months. Service is always great. Frequent customers, get stamps for loyalty rewards.
Haley F.}New York, NY}112}33}15}-1}4}7/14/2017}Rai Rai Ken is my go-to ramen spot. It's reasonably priced, fast, and yummy. I'm not a ramen-fanatic so it does the trick for me, I love the space -- they have about 10 bar seats that peak into the tiny kitchen space. They also have 4-5 traditional tables. This is HUGE compared to what it was before the renovation (many many moons ago).I usually get the Shoyu Ramen Noodle Soup and an order of gyoza and pork buns. I'm always happy with my meal because it's consistently good. Not blow-your-socks-off but dependable. I think that's worth 4 stars.There is often a wait and you write your name down on a little scratchpad but it moves quickly. This isn't a place where you have a long relaxing meal. You're in and out.They have a good happy hour deal, too!
Saba A.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}86}31}0}-1}4}7/13/2017}Great deal with the starter ( I always get the chicken nugget style things), ramen and ice cream scoop all for $20! Service is OK and the food comes out quickly. It's a place to go for a quick good bite and awesome value for money!
Murat G.}Manhattan, New York, NY}43}2}0}-1}4}7/3/2017}The service overall was fast and warm, however the food itself was nothing rave-worthy. The vegetable dumplings were great, but the non-soup vegetarian ramen was heavily drenched in oil and the flavor was quite peculiar. However, the fried chicken was good.
Wilma R.}Toronto, Canada}40}117}252}18}4}6/8/2017}The ramen was so good! I had the shoyu, which has the soy sauce broth, and it had such a good taste. This location is also really pretty due to the cool wall deco.
Cee V.}New York, NY}4}29}5}-1}5}6/2/2017}Their ramen is not the kind of ramen you'll usually find around NYC, it's not typical. I always get the curry ramen and it hits the spot, it's salted perfectly and the chachu (pork) is just perfectly cooked. I had ramen at a lot of places and this is the only place that is doing their own damn thing. It isn't the typical hypebeast as you'd get at ramen sategaya (or whatever its called)or even ipuddo. It's has a nice and friendly atmosphere and the staff does not rush you to finish.
Jesse F.}Brooklyn, NY}39}329}3}-1}3}5/31/2017}Not the best ramen, but honestly it's exciting just to have a vegetarian ramen option. The vegetarian miso broth was kinda grainy and I didn't want to slurp it up, but it comes with sweet potatoes, beans, corn, and broccoli. If you can't stand the wait for fancy ramen around the block, this will do on a chilly night. Plus, there's a toilet with buttons that do warm water things.
Jasmine L.}New York, NY}146}2}0}-1}3}5/18/2017}Came for dinner with a friend, and we both got the combo meal that included a drink, entree, appetizer, and dessert. Since we were the only ones there at the time, our ramen came out pretty quickly. Too bad my server accidentally knocked a whole cup's worth of Calpico soda onto my skirt... They offered to reimburse my dry cleaning but I didn't think it'd be worth it to make a trip down to the city just for that. I was hoping they'd knock a few bucks off our total bill but nope :( Here's to hoping I'll be able to wash the stains off my silk skirt. But anyways the food was okay, the ramen a little too salty for my taste. I think the Kara-age was the best out of the combo.
Yuki S.}Chatham Township, NJ}0}17}18}-1}5}5/7/2017}This is MY ramen place in manhattan after trying so many places. If you like a typical American favorite rich & heavy Tonkotsu ramen, do not come here. This is not the place for those. A perfectly light and flavorful broth. A perfect portion. I like to eat ramen with gyoza. I tried so many Ramen places. I am always disappointed and come back to this place and apologize in my heart that I cheated on them.
Jenny G.}Brooklyn, NY}56}340}1894}18}5}4/30/2017}Food was great!  Even my kids love it. My husband is planning to go back again. Good Service and so friendly staffs.
Lierh L.}Manhattan, NY}23}71}88}-1}1}4/21/2017}Too salty. I ordered the miso ramen. It's too salty to taste it. And the waitress is not polite. I will not visit here again. I don't understand how they got so many good reviews.
Jessica K.}New York, NY}162}329}1081}18}2}4/15/2017}Offered a good set dinner deal for only $19.75 that came with 3 courses from appetizers, a choice of entree, to dessert. We had ordered the shio ramen, the kaarage for appetizer, yakisoba as well as the sake and the green tea mochi. The soup base for the ramen was rather bland, and the yakisoba was a bit wet. It seemed to be a fusion between Chinese and Japanese food in my opinion. I didn't really fancy the yakisoba, but the kaarage wasn't bad.
Esmeralda C.}Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY}54}313}3105}18}4}3/31/2017}Been here a few times, love the vegetarian miso ramen, the pickled vegetable fried rice and the cold teas.  The space is small, yet cozy and the staff is very accommodating and attentive.The times I've visited the place is always packed, yet I've never had to wait for a table, and I'm usually accompanied by one or two friends.My favorite part of the place is their toilet system, it has a toto washlet, which basically washes your private parts and air dries it too, it's an interesting yet amazing experience for me.  I always look forward to using the washroom for that very purpose. Their ramen customer loyalty program is cool too, if you write about them in other social outlets or are a student, you get extra stamps on it.Can't wait til I visit again.
Art C.}New York, NY}156}920}43}18}3}2/25/2017}Ordered delivery from this restaurant. Their kaarage, gyoza, and (to a lesser extent) pork fried rice were absolutely delicious. Seriously. We'd order from here again just for those three items. Sadly, the ramen itself (we had the tan tan men and shoyu versions) was a bit below average. Still good, but in NYC the competition is stiff and these just didn't measure up for us...
Uni D.}New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}2/21/2017Updatedreview}WORST RAMEN EVERThe service was good but the ramen was unbelievably terrible. I ordered miso ramen and the soup I s supposed to be cooked with chicken broth but it tastes artificial Chicken flavor! The bitterness of the soup didn't go away after 15 minutes I had the ramen. Also the cabbage burnt. If the three Hispanic guys don't know how to cook Ramen please don't! I'm not here spending 15 dollars for garbage.
Janine C.}Japantown, San Francisco, CA}16}3}1}-1}4}2/17/2017}The food was AMAZING but are a star away from a full five rating because of the generic pop music that's played. I had the pork buns and the Shoyu wonton ramen. Both were incredibly delicious! I've never had a better pork bun.
R M.}New York, NY}2}18}0}-1}5}2/17/2017}Tasty ramen, perfect for a cold winter day! We had the shio, miso, and vegetable ramen, with kimchee as our starter. We've been regulars here for years and highly recommend when anyone is visiting.
Kevin E.}Brooklyn, NY}81}544}817}18}1}1/30/2017}Food was alright but service was absolutely atrocious. We came here for lunch and got the lunch specials that come with 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 drink, and 1 mochi ice cream for like $16 and change. For my appetizer, I got the pork bun and it was pretty good. I also got the Shoyu ramen which was alright. The noodles were decent and the egg was really good but I wasn't a big fan of the pork slice because it was too fatty. The broth was pretty lackluster. The mango mochi ice cream was a nice treat after the meal.Now on to where things went wrong...The bill came out to a little less than $50 and a little over $54 after tax. Calculating for the standard 15% tip, it comes out to be about $61. I gave my friend a $20 and he paid $40 (no tip) for the both of us on his card while my other friend paid $14 (40+14=54 since you can't pay more than the tax+tip) with his card and then added $6 for tip which means we paid $60 in total. When the lady came to get our receipts, she made a big ruckus about how we didn't even pay 10% tip...Uhh yes we did...No idea how she even became a waitress when she can't even do math. She then gave off a really nasty attitude and was still insistent that we were $3 short. NO. Even though we didn't pay 15% it was definitely at least 13%, which in my opinion is a gift for the (lack of) service that we got. No greeting when we walked in, no water refills, no checking up on us periodically. There's another ramen place a few blocks away where the service was absolutely amazing where I didn't mind paying 20% tip. Please go to them and learn a thing or two about hospitality before coming to me and saying I didn't tip enough. Never coming back.PS. We had no intentions of coming here for lunch. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the water system in the East Village and a lot of restaurants had to close/delay opening due to a lack of water. I have no idea where this place got their water from since literally every restaurant on the block was out of water. This place is a dump.
Clara M.}Albany, CA}1}42}0}-1}5}1/27/2017}I've been here twice and gotten the Tan Tan Men twice. At $12, it is a decent price (they have ramen punch cards to get one free after 10) for ramen in the city and it is absolutely delicious. Great broth and noodle texture, and large enough to make you either feel so full you can't walk, cry because it is so good and you can't finish it, or have a small meal to go. The restaurant is very small and seems mostly for take-out, so it could be hard to get a seat on a busy day but both times I went I was seated easily. Nice staff!
Diana C.}Brooklyn, NY}52}43}15}-1}3}1/22/2017}I came here only because Curry-ya was super packed and this was close by. I've had many a ramen, including in Japan so I can't say I would come here again--let this review serve as a reminder to myself to not come back ...I ordered the curry flavored ramen. It was basically like a shoyu ramen doused in some curry flavoring. Considering the fact that I was originally craving real curry, of course this would disappoint. The noodles are too thick for my liking and the flavor was lacking. My cousin wasn't hungry and wanted to share and lo and behold the waitress tells us about the $12 per head minimum in tiny print. I suppose they need that because the food isn't that great. The only decent dish was the negi rice which was filled with flavors. It was a mixture of some seaweed, scallions, Bonita flakes, radish combined with soy sauce and rice. Sorry if my review is harsh, but I'm picky about ramen, I can't help it.
Eileen N.}Manhattan, New York, NY}158}2}2}-1}5}1/16/2017}Food is great! I've been here about 5 times and I always get quality ramen! Always consistent! One of my favorite ramen places in the city!
p k.}Brooklyn, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}1/1/2017}Rock-solid ramen shop. Their shoyu is reliably excellent, but my favorite may be the hiyashi chuka, which is only available in summer.
T O.}Manhattan, NY}0}14}0}-1}2}12/23/2016}You get what you pay for. Rude service and soggy noodles in watered down broth. Went during lunch time and was only one eating. Too bad. Chef seemed to care and want to provide good service and quality food though
Jane M.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}12/20/2016}Love this place!  Great ramen soups and excellent pork bun too. The restaurant is small and cozy. The staff is friendly. This is my go to place on a cold day - or night!
Karen L.}Queens, NY}7}10}38}-1}4}12/20/2016}I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Rai Rai Ken. I saw a fellow Yelp reviewer's comment pointed that the staff here are not all Japanese. What does that take away from the delicious food and amazing service that is so consistent? Nada. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food, ramen has always been cooked to a perfect bouncy bite, broth is delicious, their fried rice is super flavorful and who can beat their specials?! ($17 lunch set comes with appetizer, drink, main course, and dessert.) I've had the shoyu, curry and mabo ramen, all the broth bases were packed with flavor and never too watery. Best part though, has always been their service! Ok, enough words, uploading pictures to do the rest of the talking.
Wahed K.}Astoria, NY}651}734}1505}18}3}12/16/2016}Rai Rai Ken serves lighter broth than I what I am used to but it does so pretty well. I came here on a whim and decided to try the shoyu ramen. They let you choose the firmness of the noodle and the saltiness of the broth. I went with the firmest noodle and a medium broth along with a mini chashu don on the side.I found the broth more along the lines of what I would expect at a soba place. The website says the broth is a mixture of pork and chicken while their menu only mentioned chicken. Either ways, I found the broth was slightly on the sweet side and not having enough umami.  I don't think they did a great job on the dashi. The firm noodles were ok.
Pankaj M.}Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}12/15/2016}Great ramen !! They have some of the best noodles I've had. There gyoza where super crunchy. The pork buns we had were perfect, they  were very flavorful and addicting. I had the best seaweed salad that I ever had in my life. Curry Ramen is a must have, it was with corn and mild spicy enough to swallow it all.
Kin H.}Brooklyn, NY}69}5}0}-1}5}12/3/2016}One of the best ramen I've had. I ordered the shio ramen. Cheap sake beer. The manager and severs are nice. I will come back.
Susan V.}New York, NY}6}151}10}-1}2}12/2/2016}Was excited to try the Mabo ramen. I love mabo tofu and thought this would be a meaty, tofu, spicy goodness with ramen. It wasn't. Instead what I got served was a bowl of broth mixed with a bit of mabo mix so everything tasted watered down, there was maybe about 5-6 cubes of tofu in the bowl and some pieces of ground meat floating around the bowl. Seems like it was false advertising.
Yang Y.}Manhattan, NY}77}2}1}-1}5}11/10/2016}It's really to hard to explain how appreciate rai rai ken helped me find my wallet! Thank you so much! I love this ramen shop since I was living in tokyo~ rai rai Ken provides the best 中華料理~ even in NYC they provide best ramen and best customer service~ 本当にありがとうございます
Aimee L.}Mastic Beach, NY}131}102}507}-1}3}11/10/2016}The dinner ($19.75) and lunch (~$16) sets are awesome, in terms of value: comes with a drink, appetizer, entree, and dessert! The pork buns are delicious! It comes with three spoons to add flavor: one with chili paste and the other two with unknown substances that I was not adventurous enough to try. The ramen was subpar. I ordered the shio ramen and it wasn't to my liking. I prefer heavier, more flavorful broths and this just wasn't it. The broth was too light and the toppings were also very mediocre. Honestly, even the picture on the menu looked better than the actual ramen... The verdict: Will stop by here again for the pork buns and hop over to another ramen place in the village afterwards.
Jessica M.}New York, NY}245}152}563}18}3}11/6/2016}Came here on a Friday night around 6:45 pm and we were seated immediately. Other restaurants in the area had around an hour of wait time. We were seated all the way in the back. The waiters made me feel a little rushed - after receiving the menu for a couple minutes, we were asked several times if we were ready to order. The prices are cheap compared to other ramen places in the area. We all got the Shoyu ramen for only $11. The Shoyu was just OK. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't leave a great impression. The broth was a little too watery for me. But for the price, I can't complain. The service was quick. Our water glasses were never empty. The bill came out to be around $14 for each of us including tip and tax. I guess it was worth it for the price. If anyone's in the area and is looking for a cheaper alternative for ramen with okay quality, then this is the place.
Richard H.}New Paltz, NY}57}20}1}-1}4}10/28/2016}Friday night. Busy. Needed a place to have a quick dinner before a party at a friend's house. This place totally fits the bill. Good food and a great $29.95 dinner combo. Worth it.
Jecica P.}Staten Island, NY}0}3}2}-1}5}10/25/2016}Really enjoyed this place. It is small but that's what I personally like because it feels cozy. The ramen was a good portion size and it was very good. They also have lunch specials and dinner specials . And the Sapporro beer was also very good and COLD! Just how I like it. I will definitely visit this place again!!
Benny L.}Staten Island, NY}43}159}10}-1}2}10/14/2016}Service was good. Waiter was attentive and quick. Ramen came out pretty fast. Ordered the Shoyu Ramen and it was pretty disappointing. Noodles were overcooked, portion was small and the chashu was very chewy. I was still hungry afterwards which usually never happens after a bowl of ramen.
Ken I.}River Edge, NJ}1}1}3}-1}5}9/7/2016}The reviews about this place make me sick. I feel like there are too many people in the city that benchmark quality based on this horrific trend of tonkotsu ramen that's really just cheap Tokyo college grub disguised as sophisticated restaurant fare.  Today, the classic shoyu ramen is hard to make and find whether here or in Japan. Rai Rai Ken does a remarkable job of recreating the flavor and experience of old-school ramen that is surprisingly rare in a city that prides itself as a body of refined taste.  I found consistency of this nostalgic flavor in other dishes like, most notably, the karaage which was crispy, juicy, and had some wicked homestyle flavoring that reminded me of hugging my momma. This is real ramen, period. Complaints about lack of flavor just shows how inadequate the ability to truly taste food has become. I'm hoping Rai Rai Ken will be around a long time to teach people about the wonderful subtleties that exist in good food before we become complete slaves to these "extreme" flavor trends that seem to be taking over. You will find very few ramen restaurants in NYC that have this level of care and quality put into the food. The others will drug you with gimmicks and salty experiments.  This place asks that you just pay attention to what you're eating. Dummy.
Priscilla C.}Sacramento, CA}169}302}1553}18}4}9/3/2016}This place is more like a 3.5 stars. I don't want to give 4 stars, but it doesn't really fit 3 stars either. For me, 3 stars mean I wouldn't return to the restaurant, but I would come back to this one again some day. Since this is a ramen spot and I'm a big ramen fan, there's many places I must compare this to. There's toto, minca, mu, zundo-ya, ippudo, etc. We ordered the shio and miso ramen with the dinner set ($19) which includes an appetizer, entree, drink, dessert and 2 daily small dishes. The shio ramen wasn't the worst I've ever had nor was it the best, but it was pretty good. The flavor was good and pretty light which I can appreciate. Texture of the noodle was great. I did not like the pork though because it wasn't charred with a torch like they usually do at other spots. They also gave one piece of pork, but it was a lot thicker than most ramen places. The toppings were pretty standard with an egg, bamboo shoots, seaweed for the shio. The miso ramen didn't have an egg, but had corn instead which they usually charge extra at other ramen places. The miso was a "normal" miso ramen. The fried garlic was good in it though. The kara-age (fried chicken) I chose as appetizer was pretty good. The meat was really juicy and tender and it was dark meat, which is what I prefer. The pork bun was just okay. I've def had better pork buns. Also, do not pay extra for hot chili oil if you are ordering the pork bun because it comes with the bun on a side spoon. They dinner sets also include a spoon of seaweed and another spoon of cucumbers. Dessert was mochi ice cream with a choice of mango, red bean, sesame, green tea. I would come back for their lunch set (more worth it).
Jon T.}New York, NY}169}14}34}-1}3}8/26/2016}Came here with 3 others after drinks around 1:30AM on a Sunday (so drinks Saturday night till morning). They close at 2, but were willing to let us stay and eat.Food:Miso Ramen - It was a decent sized portion with good broth and noodles. Came out quickly and hot. The only downside to the this is that the broth was alittle too salty for my taste and didn't have that distinct miso flavorings. Still a good bowl of ramen. Service:Quick and attentive, though being the last customers probably played a major role.Atmosphere:Its a small ramen shop that is a perfect place to jump in for a quick ramen fix. Conclusion:Definitely will come back with the occasion pops up. The ramen isn't as good as some other notable ramen places, but this place offers a quick and easy fix without the long wait in line. Though this is only our second time coming and the last time was also late night around midnight. So maybe its our timing...
Kira L.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}5}7/28/2016}The absolute best ramen in NYC. I eat here at least once a week. It's my go to place in the east village . Can't get enough.
Ruby S.}Manhattan, NY}384}173}330}-1}3}7/18/2016}This is a ramen place. They have other things like yaki soba (which I learned is actually NOT made with soba noodles - however yaki means fried and soba means noodle), fried rice and appetizers like pork buns. They don't use MSG and they have rice noodle options for those who can't eat gluten (sad people like me). The interior is strewn with Japanese signs and the area near the kitchen is made of (looks like) bamboo to give an authentic look. Yaki Soba (B)Expecting soba noodles, this was served with ramen noodles. The taste was subtle which may be good for some, but I enjoy really bold flavors. It was a little bland for me. I could taste the ginger and garlic but they were muted. The noodles were perfectly al dente and chewy, but I was not a fan. Vegetable Miso Soup (with rice noodles) (A-)The broth was good. It had a strong miso flavor and was thicker than I thought it was going to be. The noodles were cooked perfectly, though at the end of course they got a bit soggy. There was corn and seaweed and three snow peas. Two little trees of broccoli, strangely pink carrots and was topped with scallions and chili flakes. It was nicely presented and good but I probably wouldn't order it again. The restaurant on a Monday night was not poppin. Can't tell if this is normal or the restaurant really isn't a fave. If I was in a ramen mood Nd in the neighborhood I might go. I wouldn't travel across town on the nasty subway or uber my way here just to eat. Good but not amazing.
Kato L.}Los Angeles, CA}1}17}20}-1}5}7/17/2016Updatedreview}Authentic Ramen!!! None of the fusion stuff out there!!! The pork bun dances for joy on your palate - 5 stars. The Shoyu Ramen noodles the right Al-dente texture, broth... Yes the broth the correct amount of flavor!  Kato's 5-star!!!! You want authentic stomach filling mouth smiling Ramen?  Come to this place!
Ryan Z.}ANNANDALE, NY}19}2}1}-1}1}6/20/2016}Had dinner here tonight and the food was not bad. However, they charged more than the number I wrote down in the receipt! It's only a small amount of money but dishonest conduct is unacceptable. They kept telling me I checked the box of 18% tip but the truth is I only wrote down the total amount and didn't check anything. I called them and they didn't apologize, just kept saying I am just letting you know you checked that box. It seems they checked the box themselves and ignored the total amount I wrote. I'm so disappointed.
Nanciee C.}Brooklyn, NY}49}226}214}-1}3}6/19/2016}After walking around the area for a while and looking at the options from several restaurants, my cousin and I settled with Rai Rai Ken. She wanted to eat ramen, and we were looking for something on the more affordable side. Came in and were seated immediately. It was cool and quite clean inside. The menu was also quite easy to look at, and we did not take long to decide what we wanted. Since we had eaten something before, we were looking to share. We got a dinner set, and nom nom. Quick and decent dinner.I have had better ramen from other locations, but for a place to be quick, clean and decent priced, this was pretty good.
May L.}New York, NY}0}30}77}-1}4}5/30/2016}Mapo tofu on ramen is the way to go. Lunch set includes appetizer, main course, drink, and Mochi ice cream for dessert for 16.50.  Chicken karaage is spot on with just the right amount of crunch.
Jacqueline C.}Maui, HI}49}31}182}-1}4}5/30/2016}Tsuke-men dipping Ramen.  Perfect noodle texture, I didn't notice that the noodles come chilled...it was still very good I just prefer my noodles hot.  The dipping sauce was good but very salty.No wait.  Quick service.  Nice and air conditioned and clean.  I got a seat where I could watch the staff cook.With tip my meal came out to $18.29.  For the quality I felt this price was fair.
Shio N.}Vancouver, Canada}0}17}32}-1}1}5/26/2016}Ordered shio ramen with corn and it was way too salty. You don't realize it when it's hot but I felt like I was having salt water. Also, the people who were making ramen were not Japanese either...only the servers were Japanese.** my reply to the business manager **I am sure that they are highly trained chefs I am not doubting that but it does effect the experience. If you went to have souvlaki at a Greek restaurant and only saw Chinese people in the kitchen making it, would it feel authentic? But this is just my personal opinion.
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}3}5/20/2016}I've definitely had better ramen in NYC, so if someone's telling you that this is the best ramen they've ever had...something's fishy.We came later in the evening - around 9:30PM - because we tried to stop by at Momofuku noodle bar on the way in but the wait was too long. Thankfully, we caught the tail end of Rai Rai Ken's dinner special which runs from 7-10PM and is perfect for those who eat dinner later.For the dinner special, I ordered the curry ramen, the cha shu, hot green tea, and the green tea mochi ice cream. The curry ramen was nothing special - I ordered it only because I know my friend likes it; I actually found it too salty. I also prefer lighter broths, which the curry ramen is the complete opposite of. Shoyu for me, next time! The pork belly in the ramen also had wayyy too much fat on it..and it was bland. Fortunately, the chashu pork belly was quite delicious. The side dishes of blanched okra in a soy sauce and sesame oil dressing and the wakame-like seaweed were also simple and yummy. The green tea and the mochi ice cream were much appreciated, and helped round out the meal. I don't know if they offer refills of hot water because I didn't ask, but I'm hoping they do! Overall, I think that they offer great value with the $17 dinner specials, but in terms of ramen, there are plenty of better places in the city.
Adam Y.}Jersey City, NJ}317}153}127}-1}3}5/17/2016}I came here on a Friday and had no problem being seated. We all ordered the dinner special for $17, which came with a drink, appetizer, entree, and dessert. Yes, you can get a sapporo or sake that is included in the $17.  I got the pork bun, shoyu ramen, and mango mochi. The pork bun and shoyu ramen was good. Definitely good for the price you pay for this small little ramen joint. The mochi tasted like old school pink bubblegum. It was actually pretty disgusting and had no mango taste whatsoever. I definitely do not recommend that at all. Overall, I would come back for that killer dinner special.
J W.}Elmhurst, NY}2}28}76}-1}4}5/8/2016}The place is big and bright unlike many tiny ramen places. The ramen is good. Want to come back and try many different types.The lunch special is great with appetizer, ramen, choice of drink and mochi ice cream. Pretty nice and very hearty. They also have happy hour. Should check it out.Cash only.
Lils Y.}Manhattan, NY}191}231}175}-1}2}5/5/2016}Definitely a no. Sorry to say, but possibly worst ramen I've ever spent money on..Came here on a weekday for dinner, about a 10 minute wait for 4 ppl. CASH only.Had the Shoyu ramen which came with the toughest pork slice (with no fat or flavor), in the blandest soup, with a very soft textured wavy ramen noodle (needed to be more al dente). Basically everything was disappointing and I couldn't even finish the ramen.The lunch and dinner sets here seem like a great deal, but overall I wouldn't consider it worth it.Other options around the area - Raku (udon), Ippudo or Momofuku for ramen.
Jayden H.}New York, NY}21}24}1}-1}2}5/1/2016}My friend and I ordered delivery and both of us couldn't even eat our dishes, they were horrible! This is coming from someone who eats ramen all the time!
Sejal B.}New York, NY}341}76}377}-1}3}4/26/2016}Came here on a Tuesday night after having a craving for some soup. In short, the portions are huge, but the food is very bland and flavorless. Thank God for the side condiments which actually make it a lot better.The service is great and everybody was very attentive. The only thing with this vegetarian miso soup was that it was extremely bland. I was really hoping for something a lot more flavorful and spicy. But the only thing that I actually really did save the soup was that the condiments on the side included chili oil, Sriracha, soy sauce, salt-and-pepper as well some other sauces. After adding a large abundance of these condiments to the soup it started to taste better. Other than the bland and flavorless taste I liked The fact that the portions were huge for a pretty good price. The soup was also filled with a bunch of vegetables and noodles and tofu. It was really filling and satisfying once I added some taste to it.
Lawrence L.}Brooklyn, NY}2}49}0}-1}3}4/24/2016}Narrow hole in the wall with Japanese banners on the door, mimics a tiny traditional Japanese ramen restaurant. Situated on a block with a row of other Japanese businesses, Rai Rai serves decent ramen in the hustle bustle of the East Village without the wait.
Stephanie R.}Manhattan, NY}33}39}0}-1}4}4/18/2016}Still an East Village well-kept secret - rather than waiting in line for Ippudo, Momofuku, or Minca, head to Rai Rai Ken. Their dinner special includes everything you could possibly want for $17, and has quickly become a favorite spot of ours. As part of the special, you pick any ramen dish, an appetizer (gyoza, pork buns, shumai, gomae, etc.), a drink (beer, sake, soft drink, etc.), and your preferred flavor of mochi. It doesn't get much better than that! To top it off, happy hour ends when it normally does, but then it starts up again at 10:00pm and runs until close. So if you enjoyed your appetizer and want another bite once you're done with your mochi, you can order half-price gyoza to top off the night!
Shirley C.}Manhattan, NY}158}94}14}-1}4}4/14/2016}Came here on a Tuesday night with two other friends and we ordered the mapo tofu ramen, shoyu and the tsukemen. They gave me a HUGE serving of noodles for my tsukemen!! Those who know me know I can put it down, but I had some trouble finishing all those noodles. The dipping sauce/soup to noodle ratio seemed a little disproportionate as I definitely could have used some more soup. But no worries! My friends didn't finish their mapo tofu or shoyu ramen soups and I had fun dipping my noodles into their broths to I could finish off my noodles (and having a taste of the other ramen soups).We also ordered the gyoza and karage chicken as appetizers. The karage was piping hot and came with a side of mayo which I enjoyed! Our servers were polite and we always seemed to have our cups filled. Giving it 4 stars for the sheer amount of noodles I received (aka they were not just a cheapos). Once again, thanks!P.S. Cash only
Christina Ann H.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}0}17}1}-1}1}4/12/2016}Rai Rai Ken has been my go-to delivery order for ramen. I've hit most of the ramen places in the area in person, including RRK, but found that their ramen was the best and most consistent for delivery (even though it is definitely not the best ramen in the area). Unfortunately, I will not be ordering from them anymore as I found a large bug in my broth last night. Imagine how I felt after having a long day, trying to enjoy one of my favorite foods that I ordered to make myself feel better only to find a bug in it. I felt sick afterwards. I tried calling for a refund once this morning but apparently no managers were in so I've still yet to see how they handle this.
Tatiana G.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}4/10/2016}Always wanted to try Ramen, so I googled this place , very nice cozy place good service and food is fantastic for the price it's just fine . Desert is great. Was very pleased if I'm in the neighborhood definitely coming back.
Kevin Z.}Manhattan, NY}127}408}309}18}4}3/28/2016}Dinner special for $17 with bowl of noodle, app, a drink and top off with moche? that's a deal.Food is awesome and delicious. Don't really remember what I tired but we picked 3 noodles and they are all good. Call ahead for a seat and they will accommodate.
Jennifer B.}Woodstock, NY}2}10}0}-1}4}2/15/2016}Yum. I have been coming here for years, since back in the day when they had the property next door. Some of the atmosphere has gone since the move (hence the drop in a star) as the ambience in the old spot was second to none. However the Ramen and gyoza continue to deliver. A solid spot, you cant go wrong.
Joshua S.}Manhattan, NY}0}13}1}-1}4}2/13/2016}Great Ramen, super close to Momafuku and Ippudo if you can't get in there, don't waste your time.....just come here and you will get the same thing....really good.
Matt C.}Manhattan, NY}1370}376}352}18}4}2/10/2016}Rai Rai Ken is our go-to ramen spot in the EV. Ippudo and Momofuku are great, but the lines can be crazy long and sometimes, you just gotta get a good bowl of ramen fast.I almost always get the lunch or dinner specials here, which comes with a bowl of any ramen, an appetizer, a drink, and a mochi for dessert. I can't remember the prices exactly, but I think it was around $14.The pork buns here are amazing, rivaling Ippudo's. The housemade sweet and spicy chili sauce they serve with them is out of this world, and I am glad they give me a bowl big enough to spread all over my bun.The ramen is solid. I tend to get the shoyu ramen, but have also had the japanese curry ramen base here. Both of which are great. I like a lot of spice, to I usually dump that sweet chili oil into my broth too. There is a good ratio of noodles to broth, a well-cooked soft-boiled egg, some pork, some green onions and other garnish as well. Delicious.I have only had to wait here one time for a table, it seems that Rai Rai Ken has found a good balance of quick service, and a crowd that likes a quick turnaround. I wouldn't expect a party to come here and sit for hours, it's in-eat-out for most.The place is small and not as well decorated as some of their competitors, but does that really matter? I put Rai Rai Ken solidly in the top three ramen spots in the neighborhood.
Rosally S.}New York, NY}0}7}11}-1}3}2/3/2016}Service and atmosphere is good, feels pure East Village classic. The chasu pork was delicious, slightly thick but not too thick, perfectly seasoned and a bit crispy on the edges. The mochaccino mochi was tasty, plump and delightful. Seems like a great spot to hang out. Just know the ramen itself is not special compared to say Ramen Setagaya (same price point ~$10, consistently delicious and zero wait, just not for lingering/hanging out) or the amazing Ippudo ($15 "category defining" ramen, fun atmosphere with significant waiting time). Because I'm in it for the food more so than the atmosphere I'd skip this place next time and do one of the two other ramen spots I mentioned. However, If I just wanted to nosh on bites while hanging out with a group of friends who drink, I'd probably suggest RaiRai Ken with a couple caveats. Cash only - not a biggie but should be noted if you're eating with friends.
Megan D.}ASTORIA, NY}248}119}114}-1}4}2/1/2016}This place is da bomb.My heart will always belong to hinomaru  (if not astoria) but this place is a top contender. I love the prices, the service, the atmosphere and more importantly the ramen. Very delicious, not too salty (after ramen I usually feel close to experiencing my first stroke) and filled with great tasting noodles!The lunch special is so reasonable- and they offer mochi and the end! SO DELICIOUS!Presentation is beautiful and honestly if it wasn't for my health conscious lifestyle I'd come here more!
Lingyi P.}Chicago, IL}279}91}18}-1}4}1/28/2016}Stopped by here on a Sunday night and got seats for two without any wait. It's a cute little place that's not too fancy and has an authentic feel. I got the shoyu ramen which has pork along with loads of vegetables like bamboo shoots. I was pleased that there was plenty of ingredients besides the noodles and meat. The service was quick and the price very reasonable. Would visit again!
James C.}Brooklyn, NY}443}7}0}-1}4}1/27/2016}for the price of the dinner special, you cant go wrong. there is not always a wait, but sometimes there is. service is exceptional. would definitely go back there for ramen again.
Yannie H.}New York, NY}13}106}68}18}5}1/18/2016}Cute manager and waiter, excellent services, shio ramen was great not as salty as other ramen places. Would love to come back when I have cravings
Anita J.}New York, NY}0}12}0}-1}4}1/15/2016}Went here for a dinner on a Saturday. We got there at around 7 and it was seemed to be just before it got really busy as we were able to get seats right away and there were around 2 tables left but when we were leaving around 8 there were groups of people waiting outside. The place isn't that large and the tables they have are for 2 people so not recommended for large parties. Menu items are cheap ($10 for ramen) and tasted really good. Noodles were not soggy, broth was flavourful. Portions size was decent and I left quite full. Food came out relatively quickly (under 10 minutes) after ordering. They have dinner specials for $17 that include appetizer and ramen. I would definitely go here again!
Ned S.}Brooklyn, NY}0}13}6}-1}4}1/9/2016}Very good and reliable. I started with pork buns, which were good. Nice cut of pork and tasty sauce. Then I had the Ma Po Tofu soup to which I added some Kimchi for extra flavor. I've been a few times and had this combo, which I love. However, full disclosure, I usually only go here when the line at Ippudo is too long.
Hamilton W.}New York, NY}45}161}8}18}2}1/4/2016}Ehh... There's a reason there's not much of a wait here. It's okay if you are craving ramen and happen to be next door. A bit salty and the fried chicken wasn't that good.
Kelly E.}New York, NY}117}394}56}18}4}1/3/2016}Dinner specials = BOMB. Cute little ramen place, the noodles and broth are about standard but you'll find the sides and happy staff make the meal really enjoyable. The lines get long on popular nights (friday and saturdays) but it is a fun neighborhood to walk around so it's no big deal.No option to order the noodles firm or well done. Next time I'll stop by for a lunch special!
Caroline A.}Brooklyn, NY}1}10}7}-1}5}12/23/2015}My favorite place in NY, for years. I loved it when it was a small little bar-seated restaurant, and I love it now. The food is delicious, the shoyu ramen and gyoza are amazing. It'll forever be my go-to place. My son has become a fan too and all my friends enjoyed it as well!
Corey C.}Astoria, NY}30}117}4}-1}4}12/19/2015}I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews here, because I had a great time!I went there for a Friday night dinner, and there was only a five-minute wait. Service was very attentive - none of our glasses of water were ever empty.The dishes were very reasonably priced (~$10), had above-average portions, and tasty all around. I enjoyed everything about the curry ramen (which FYI is thankfully not spicy at all) I ordered and would gladly have it again.The music they play is a Top 40 blend that for some reason reminds me of shopping at Express. And the bathroom has a Japanese-style toilet if you feel so inclined to experience a heated seat.I'll definitely be coming back here! (And if you're looking to cap off your meal for the night, just head across the street to ChikaLicious Dessert Bar!)
Mikey H.}Manhattan, NY}27}112}1}-1}4}12/13/2015}The Lunch and dinner menu deal is tough to beat. Their appetizers are pretty great: can't go wrong with shumai, gyoza, shishito peppers. Miso ramen makes miso happy. The chicken tastes a little wonky; but the rest of the soup is very good. Curry soup ain't half bad, either. The best part? The dessert. Red bean moji all the way. Tastes like mamas baking. Go here!
Lexi A.}Manhattan, NY}1}20}7}-1}5}12/12/2015}Delicious & authentic Ramen.Great combo deals.Had to order a second veggie Gyoza Because it was that good.
Rita L.}Manhattan, NY}1497}521}5346}18}2}11/25/2015}Rai Rai Ken just isn't as good as other ramen shops in the area. I'd recommend picking another place if you're really looking for a good bowl of ramen. Their soup base doesn't have the normal thickness and actually taste a bit weird. It's a quick meal and you don't have to wait in line, but there are so many other options around that are way better. I'd say this is definitely on the bottom of my list.
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}3}11/24/2015}I like to think of RRK as several notches below even the most un-fussy ramen joints in the East Village: sling back a Sapporo, slurp up noodles with vigorous lip-smacking sounds, and, at the end of it all, when you can see the bottom of your bowl, unbutton the top part of your pants and sigh in satisfaction. Everything here is pretty casual, from the disposable chopsticks to the waitresses chatting loudly with each other in Japanese. Fine dining it's not, but you can kick back and be your most unvarnished self here without feeling self-conscious. Happy hour nets you two pork buns at $6 - though they're half the buns at Momofuku, the pork is not as tender or as fatty. Going along with my streak of not ordering the dish a restaurant is most famous for, I opted for the pork fried rice and a soup on the side. It's definitely comfort food for when it's rainy and cold. Also noteworthy to probably only me: my friend's $3 sake was poured out, a tad sloppily, into this little shellacked box on a plate. Towards the end, there was more sake on the plate than in the box, and it make gracefully drinking the dregs impossible. NEXT TIME: maybe the mapo tofu ramen - I think this is the first time I've seen the dish converted into ramen form.
Azar H.}Manhattan, NY}4}34}0}-1}1}11/22/2015}The service was kind and pork bun delicious, unfortunately 20 minutes later my stomach was twisting in pain.
Tessa M.}Manhattan, NY}258}23}1}-1}2}11/16/2015}Just OK. I ordered on Seamless (Miso Ramen + soft boiled egg for $1.50 extra) the egg didn't come and when I tried to call, I was just put on hold and then disconnected - twice. The broth was fine, nothing special, but I don't see the need to order from here again.
Kristen R.}Homer, AK}11}8}0}-1}1}11/13/2015}This was THE WORST ramen I have EVER had. They served bamboo shoots from a plastic bag and tin canned corn from Del Monte. We ordered the house favorites only to be disappointed with bland, non aromatic soup that tasted syrupy and smelled of old gym shorts. We tried to finish our meals but literally had to force ourselves and realized that was ridiculous. I asked for the manager who was one of the waitresses and apologized as I felt bad for making a complaint but was met with condescension as we were told our chef was a top chef and it would insult him. Insult him?!!!! How about insulting us with your store bought broth, canned and processed foods. If we wanted processed food, we would have gone to Mcdonalds and they taste exponentially better than the dog food passing as human food at this ramen restaurant.  We had to pay for the full bill despite making a polite complaint. I will NEVER go to this establishment for food again and certainly suggest you do not either!
Yiwan Y.}New York, NY}102}53}0}-1}3}11/11/2015}Good down to earth reman. However, I found the soup is a bit too hot and the noodle/soup ratio is out of balance.
Jean T.}New York, NY}323}3}0}-1}5}11/10/2015}Love this place! I've been going here for over 6 years now (before they moved to this bigger space, they had a very charming smaller one down the block) The ramen is delicious and the service is fast! It can get crowded, but that's to be expected; worth the wait IMO. Just don't forget it's cash only.
M. M.}New York, NY}0}217}14}-1}1}11/9/2015Updatedreview}Not sure what happen here, The first time saw a great experience which is why I craved to go back for more.The second time was a complete turn around, Service was rude and dismissive and the food was subpar.Even the soup I liked to much the first time was salty and lacking..... Not going to be returning here.
J J.}New York, NY}0}162}24}-1}1}11/3/2015Updatedreview}Checked in on 10/31/15 for Dinner.Shoyu Ramen - Not as good as the first time.  This time found a bug in my soup : ( Seafood Fried Rice - Pork flavor is definitely better.  Did not know nor was it indicated on the menu the use of dried shrimp for this dish... It would've been nice to know because some people really really don't like the taste of that. : (Customer service was not good, not attentive, and not suggestive this time.Would not go back after this experience.
tim e.}Seattle, WA}5}37}0}-1}4}10/27/2015}This is one of my favorite places in the city. A place that seems like it could only exist in the US in NYC. I think this is solid ramen at a pretty good price
Robert M.}Southampton, NY}1}16}52}-1}4}10/22/2015}I'm visiting this delicious Ramen noodle shop for years now ever since I live on 14th and second back in 1999, now we drive-in and at least stop for pork bun on each and every trip to the city I take absolutely love this place! The soups are delicious made with fresh perfectly prepared ingredients. Even when the please move from a small shop to nearly double its size, it did not sacrifice one drop of flavor!!!
Tim P.}Castro Valley, CA}55}4}15}-1}4}10/21/2015}While visiting the city I missed having my pork buns the way other places prepared it. Luckily for me I happen to come across this tucked in Korean restaurant. The presentation simple yet delicious meal met my eager and hungry expectations. Hour hour is a plus! The staff was a delight as well as the superior customer service towards their guests. Highly recommend this spot for your next ramen fix. Tim from California
Lorraine C.}New York, NY}317}118}109}-1}3}10/19/2015}It is decent for a quick ramen fix, but I have definitely had better. I only come here because my boyfriend loves eating ramen here, but I would definitely choose higher end ramen spots like Ippudo or Totto Ramen. But I do understand Rai Rai Ken is not a high end ramen joint, and it does not try to be either, so it should not be compared to places like Ippudo. However, if I am really craving ramen, those would be the places I would hit first. We only stopped by here because Ippudo and Momofuku were both a two hour wait and my boyfriend and I were too hungry to wait. It is a pretty small place, a few tables and some seats at the bar.I have tried the Curry Ramen, the Shoyu Ramen, and the Mabo Ramen. They all tasted decent. However, I felt that the broth is generally too thick and tasted too much like MSG. The ramen was very similar to packaged ramen. When I ate the Curry Ramen, it felt like too much was going on, I did not really know what I was tasting. There were too many ingredients conflicting with each other and it was not very well balanced. The appearances of the Curry Ramen and the Mabo Ramen were a little messy. The Shoyu Ramen was more presentable. We also tried their pork buns and they were quite tasty. Service was pretty good for us. Our server was very friendly and attentive, despite how busy it was during dinner time on a Saturday night. The food also came out in a reasonable amount of time. The busboy was also very attentive to any water refills we needed. Pricing is decent for the amount of food. One regular sized bowl of ramen here was good enough for me, I could not even finish a bowl on my own. Bring cash! They do not accept credit!
Brandon L.}Bronx, NY}101}49}97}-1}4}10/19/2015}I recommend getting the lunch special combo if you can, which is just $15. Comes with a bowl of ramen, mini appetizer, dessert, and a drink! Also check out their bathroom as they have a bidet lol.
Elizabeth P.}Bronx, NY}0}17}1}-1}5}10/14/2015}I love this place so very much. I am very sad to see the plum wine off the menu. Sigh. But still overall a great place. It definitely gets crowded and there will probably be a wait. This place is so awesome, their prices are reasonable. Their service is stellar. Ramen comes out quickly. RAI RAI KEN! PLEASE BRING BACK THE PLUM WINE!!!!!!!!!
Richard B.}Montclair, NJ}0}3}0}-1}4}10/14/2015}I have been here many times always ordering their spicy Ramen. I do have a number of favorite Ramen places as I do love my spicy Ramen and each place has a different addicting flavor. This one has tiny pieces of pork in it which makes for a hearty treat!
Undefined U.}Los Angeles, CA}6}114}19}-1}3}10/13/2015}I tend to eat alot of Ramen from all over, and went to visit with family and friends. The place is small, and the decor is decent. It got crowded when it opened, which got my attention. As for food, ordered the Karage, and the lunch special. The ramen was what I came to test, and try. It came within a few minutes, as the place got more crowded. I got the Shoyu ramen, and my first bite gave me a mediocre vibe. Soy sauce base is bland at times, but it was a bit too bland for my taste. The Karage was good, along with the Pork Bao. Mochi was last after finishing the meal, which was good. Overall, the ramen is decent. There are things it can improve on, since the flavor is lacking regardless of it being soy sauce base. I gave the ramen a 3.5/5, as for service= the servers seemed so out of it. They threw the food onto the table, and didn't even bothering serving it to each designated person. It was like "Here! Find your own food!!!!". Not a place I would go back to for Ramen to be honest. I came from LA, so there is plenty of better food out there.
Enya L.}Boston, MA}534}106}299}18}3}10/11/2015}My friend and I each got a dinner set ($17) which includes ramen, drink, bamboo & kimchi side dish, small appetizer, and mochi ice cream. It is a really good price for that much food. The noodles and broth were okay. The chasu was nice and crispy, but a bit salty. Overall, the food just fell flat and was not memorable at all.
Alan R.}Worcester, MA}0}35}0}-1}5}10/10/2015}Cash-only says it all.  Love this place.  Great service, great counter, great food, great price.  The trays were the way to go.  Gyoza was good on side and pork bun on side as well.  It's all sort of the same - so the difference is the service and the vibe.
Louie C.}New York, NY}288}125}82}-1}3}10/4/2015}Went here to grab ramen for lunch. It was pretty empty when we went and the lunch special was decently priced. It comes with ramen and Gyoza. The ramen is soy based.. Not really what I am expecting when eating ramen. This seems to be there highlight ramen so that's what I ordered. The problem with soy based ramen (after ordering it) is that when you think ramen you think fatty broth... This is not what you get.. So I had to add more soy sauce, chili oil, and all sorts of things to get my flavor right... One thing though is the aesthetic of the restaurant is very nice. It feels very Authentix Japan, one of the reasons I was interested to come inside and check it out.
Mallory P.}Jamaica, NY}787}149}53}-1}3}9/30/2015}Nice place with nice decor, very clean, reasonable prices. With all that said, the ramen broth was a little weak in my opinion. In comparison to Santouka in jersey or Toto in midtown, the broth at Rai Rai Ken tastes like water with chicken bouillon cubes. It wasn't the worst I've tasted, but it also wouldn't be included in my top 5. They serve a few other non-ramen dishes that im curious to try.
Ernesto G.}New York, NY}11}7}0}-1}2}9/27/2015}I would normally shy from bad reviews, but after hearing so much about this place, I was surprised to sample what can only be described as mediocre broth. I was surprised to see chicken rather than pork broth on the menu, but decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I couldn't live with the shredded chicken offered, so I added chashu and an egg. Well, the broth simply lacked flavor, as did the very fatty chashu that accompanied it.  Also, never before had I received a completely hard, dry boiled egg. I hope I caught RRK on a bad day, and so I give it two stars. PS. Service was good and location is great. I base my stars on food quality.
Van D.}Manhattan, NY}9}4}0}-1}4}9/24/2015}pros:this place is by far the best noodle spot in the East Village for sure!, and very affordable and gives you more for your buck then a lot of other over price noodle shops. I always go here when I can its a good place for winter time food cus it's nice cozy and warm noodle soup.cons:it's 2015! and it doesn't except no credit or debit cards at all. CASH ONLY!
Bankobao B.}New York, NY}41}7}86}-1}4}9/21/2015}Best Ramen lunch special !! I got the Mabo Ramen, pork bun ,hot tea and mocha icecream all for only $14.50. The Mabo Ramen was awesome. The noodle was not too soft, not too hard, just perfect. The broth was tasty with soft tofu and ground pork.Delicious!! Cash only so don't forget to go to a ATM!
Rebecca L.}New York, NY}208}5}0}-1}3}9/20/2015}I ordered from this place on seamless to help me with my sore throat. It was just ok. I'm sure it's better in person but just too salty for my taste. I got the shio but there was some depth to the broth like it was simmered with bones sort of like a tonkotsu broth. Either way, I wanted to check it out in person until I saw the strange replies from the manager on other reviews. Anyone else notice he's a bit insulting in almost every response? Lol...
Trey F.}New York, NY}3}38}4}-1}2}9/18/2015}The food is alright. I've been here twice now and both times its been okay: not totally bland but also not an explosion of flavor. Today I had the curry ramen and last time I had the soba noodles. The soba noodles were definitely, albeit only slightly, better. Overall, about 3 stars. They lose a star for the terrible customer service. I walked in with an iced tea and sat at my table. Before the waiter even said hello he scolded me for bringing in an outside drink and told me I needed to put it in my backpack. Great idea... let's dump iced tea all over my laptop and books. So I kinda just ignored him and put it off to the side, but man was that weird... I understand the whole premise of 'no outside food/drink' because, you know... you don't want someone to bring their own meal and just drink your happy hour beers. Or you don't want to people to bring their own beer in general. But come on... you're gonna be rude to me about an iced tea when I'm about to buy dinner at your restaurant? In hopes that I'll pay a $1.25 for your watery, gross hot tea? I should've just walked out, and I certainly won't be returning.
Mia M.}Los Angeles, CA}0}91}6}-1}1}9/11/2015}I tried to review on Seamless but it would not let me* Think twice about ordering from RRK via Seamless/Grubhub. Ordered with a 30 min est wait time and I called after it had been over an hour an a half wait.  Instead of trying to resolve the issue they said "do you want to cancel?" Then after a 5 min convo they said they would call me back. They never did. I called again and they promised to call me back again w/ a status update which they did, and said it would be another 10 mins. 15 minutes passed and nothing. It was too late to order from anywhere else, and yet the order was so late it made us late for an event we were supposed to attend.Finally after 20 mins my buzzer rang. Very frustrating and unreliable for mediocre Ramen (I've ordered Ramen before and it's not the best, but it was the only place delivering on Seamless within a decent time frame). Very frustrating experience. I will never order from here again. They said they would refund me, but I'm incredulous about that, since they didn't follow through with any of the other proclomations. Really disappointing and lame experience. It's fine if youre busy, but establishments need to update their status with Seamless/Grubhub  in order to retain any sort of reliability.
Stephanie S.}Washington, DC}147}145}53}18}3}9/7/2015}Went in for a quick lunch, since other places around the area was packed and had no immediately available seating. I was not hungry so I ended up ordering a small order of pork fried rice, while my husband ordered ramen. The food came out in no time, which we were very happy with. My fried rice was an ordinary standard fried rice. But his ramen was pretty disappointing. I can't exactly pinpoint what was exactly wrong with it, but it was very mediocre. Nonetheless, we were hungry, so we finished most of it, but I really wish it tasted better. I probably won't recommend this place to anyone.
Sameera N.}Cambridge, MA}220}135}12}18}2}9/7/2015}No no no. The food was tasteless and the service was mediocre, if not bad. We ordered the Shoyu ramen and the Mabo ramen. Flavorless. The Shoyu ramen didn't taste like ramen at all- maybe it's the chicken broth instead of pork broth but it was awful. The Mabo was so saturated with oil you can't really taste anything else. The pork bun was the only saving grace and even then it was nothing to write home about. Skip this place if you're looking for delicious and authentic ramen.
Aileen Z.}Brooklyn, NY}37}1}0}-1}4}9/6/2015}The chicken broth is outstanding. There's improvement for the chashu, but $10 a bowl is acceptable for the quality. I would give 5 stars if the chashu was better. Overall, it's still a solid chick broth ramen.
Mcky C.}Manhattan, NY}107}42}9}-1}5}9/3/2015}Yumm yumm yummmmmm!!! I had the miso ramen and my husband had the shio with a side of gyoza. This is in my top three of New York ramen. In a few months I might change it to number one. Delicious!! Cash only so don't forget to go to a ATM! :))
Sharon L.}Manhattan, NY}249}79}25}-1}3}8/27/2015}We came here upon a recommendation from a friend. Unfortunately, it wasn't as great as we expected. The decor was nice, and service was average, but the ramen definitely was not on par with some other competitors.We came around 8 PM on a Thursday evening so there was a dinner special for $17. This special came with any ramen, yakisoba, or fried rice, an appetizer, a drink, some small side dishes (kimchi and bamboo shoots), and one ice cream mochi.I ordered the shoyu ramen, with gyoza, iced oolong tea, and green tea mochi. My boyfriend ordered the curry Ramen, with kara-age (fried chicken), Sapporo beer in a 12oz can, and black sesame mochi. Compared with other places that we've been to recently (Minca and Zen6), this place is definitely on the more expensive side but the ramen tasted and felt subpar. The ramen tasted like the type of ramen that would come in a package, with a twist. The pork slice in the ramen was less tender than we expected, and was definitely chewier than the other places we've been to. Usually, this type of meat melts in your mouth. On top of that, every other Japanese ramen spot that we've been to, the ramen comes with two pork slices, but here we only get one! The portion of the ramen in general was also smaller than other spots. Long story short, unfortunately I don't think we'll be returning here. One, it's on the pricey side for what you get, and two, the taste just wasn't there.
Mendy Y.}Austin, TX}508}527}420}18}3}8/22/2015}3.5 stars. It's aite. That's about all you can say. The ramen here is priced reasonably but really is nothing special. The broth does not taste as rich as any of the other more reputable places in the city and the texture of the noodles is slightly off. It's an alright option if you're hungry and looking for a ramen fix in the East Village, but nothing to really seek out.
William L.}New York, NY}1}9}0}-1}5}7/31/2015}Good food and the place is clean and good ac on a hot day. It's legit.
Camille M.}Baltimore, MD}0}7}0}-1}5}7/26/2015}I love this place. I love coming here by myself for lunch or late night dinner. You can sit by the bar if you're a loner like me and just have a really great meal. I order the same thing every time: miso ramen, gzoya, and Sapporo. Try it. Do it. You won't regret it. Having just moved out of the city, I miss this place so much.
Angela J.}Brooklyn, NY}72}110}352}-1}4}7/25/2015}It's a very cute little spot in the village. I visited during the afternoon so  there wasn't any line at all. The ramen looked very delicious. The price is very fair and the staff were attentive. The only thing I don't like is the taste of the ramen. It was kinda bland, Maybe because I got the soy sauce flavored one. My friend who got the curry flavor enjoyed it a lot. Her ramen looked a lot more appetizing than mine. Next time I will try the curry flavor one. They have a Happy hour special and next time I will definitely be back for that and the pork buns.
Alison L.}Atherton, CA}101}592}56}18}3}7/11/2015}Very reasonable for a bowl of ramen ($10, compared to the ridiculous $16 dollars of Jin Ramen up on the Upper West Side... ugh).  The meat wasn't very good.  Some of the parts were tough and chewy, whereas the pork belly should usually be melting in your mouth.Cash only!
Jason M.}Baltimore, MD}132}5}0}-1}3}7/10/2015}This is my third visit. Pork buns are great, but ramen is less than mediocre considering other options available around the area.
Thomas W.}New York, NY}1148}770}510}18}5}7/3/2015}Noodles = Long Life!  This is the best Ramen I have had in Manhattan.  I loved the Char Siu appetizer with spicy kimchi.  However, I have finally found a top-notch Mabo Ramen in Manhattan.  I wish more of the Ramen Noodle places would serve this--a perfect blend of spicy bean curd with ground pork.  I wish this was closer to Bryant Park--I hope someone is listening?  It would make a killing.  Thanks Rai Rai Ken!
Patricia S.}New York, NY}0}12}0}-1}4}6/27/2015}Since becoming a vegetarian, I have not had a good bowl of ramen.. until tonight! Rai rai ken's miso based vegetarian ramen is full of flavor like ramen should be! My husband and his friend had the regular (chicken broth) ramen and also really enjoyed it. We will definitely return.
Tim D.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}0}-1}1}6/27/2015}I pathetic piece of roast pork, bland broth, and ice cold and mushy gyoza. Boo. Honestly, Top Ramen would've been better.
Woof K.}Paris, France}27}20}50}-1}1}6/4/2015}The fried rice is too salty and sour...too wet..not traditional way. Ma puo tofu rice is also taste bad...tofu is cold but the meat sauce is warm and sauce has many sticky things inside. Should be mixed well not like that.
Kristi L.}New York, NY}224}205}226}-1}2}6/2/2015}I have passed by this place so many times before I decided to just jump in and try it out. I really wanted to like this place (2.5 stars really) but everything just seemed a bit off for me. We ordered:-pork buns (2 for $4 during happy hour). I love pork buns, but I did not like these. The meat was slightly cold, and why were there cucumbers in the buns? (See pic) Kinda detracts from the rich taste pork buns are supposed to have. - curry ramen. Admittingly this dish was pretty good. I tried it for the difference factor but unfortunately I think I still like the regular miso ramen fare better. The broth was too watery for my taste (possibly shoyu based?) and there was spinach in my soup? (Not complaining tho, because I'm all for having more veggies in my soup!)- wonton soup. Ok so this is where I kind of got upset. My friend wasn't that hungry so this is what he ordered. He was maybe expecting a half bowl, especially since wonton soup is pretty easy to make, ingredient-wise. But instead he got a miso soup-sized bowl, which can be easily finished within 2 minutes. I was really expecting more, and needless to say, it was an awkward meal because he finished that soup way faster than I finished my ramen. Service was prompt and attentive; the girl who served us kept refilling our cups with water. The place is also quite tiny, but when we walked in there were a few tables empty. This place is a solid 2.5 stars unfortunately and I don't think I'll make a trip back, especially since there are so many better ramen choices around the area (Misoya, ippudo).
Yuya M.}Forest Hills, NY}63}77}241}-1}3}4/27/2015}Skeptical at first because a bunch of reviews had negative comments about the taste etc.Ordered shoyu (soy sauce) ramen and liked it a lot.  It kinda hit home versus the fat and salt heavy broths served at ippudo and other ramen joints that are catered to the American public.They are stingy on the chasiu (roast pork) though, only once slice instead of two.
Jiro M.}Manhattan, NY}24}107}305}-1}3}4/24/2015}I had the shoyu ramen.  Good old fashion shoyu.  Noodle and soup good.  Chashu okay.  I'd go back to try other ramen.
Ben L.}Queens, NY}943}947}2632}18}3}4/19/2015}Update on 4/22/15In response to the business manager who commented on my review. The manager replied with "But if you've got fresh, authentic ingredients in the hands of someone with a certain skill set and training, I don't believe that person's ethnicity is relevant to the food itself. Our team comprises a hand-picked group of extremely talented cooks who work hard. We really do value your feedback about the Shoyu, but if you're going to discuss the dishes, then we'd appreciate that you base your comments on their substance and not the race of the person preparing them." In my review, I made a mention of the staff as an observation, I never made a comment as to that being a determining factor on the food. If this was a closed kitchen and I had no idea who made the food, the 3 star review would still apply. I judged my experience solely on the bowl of ramen that was presented in front of me and it was just OK. Just OK food is still just OK food, no matter who makes it.Original Review.Overall, I thought this place was just OK. It's only good because it is quick but pales in comparison to other respectable ramen shops in the city. There were a lot of firsts here, first I have never seen a completely non Japanese kitchen and I have never seen spinach in my ramen before, both were not good signs.The food:Shoyu Ramen- Soy sauce flavor chicken broth, Chasu, egg, menma, spinach, fish cake, scallions and seaweed. I thought the broth was OK, it didn't blow me away with flavor. The noodles were made well, they had nice texture and a decent chew. The chasu was OK, the egg was nice but overall, as you eat the ramen, it becomes more and more salty. The spinach in the ramen was a mistake for me, I thought it was really weird. yelp.com/user_local_phot…
Jay M.}New York, NY}5}36}0}-1}5}4/16/2015}This is my joint. Never a wait. Walk right in, sit right down. Throw a simple nod to the Mexicans making killer broth behind the counter and get started. The shoyu ramen has what you are looking for. It's a perfect bowl of ramen. The noodles are perfectly chewy and brothy. I like to get a little crunchy spicy garlic oil, but not on your first go. On your first go, go au naturel. Occasionally the broth can be off, but when it's on, it's fucking on!Everything on the menu is good. The gyoza is on point. Super delicious loosely packed dumplings. I don't know why, but it makes it better. little bits fall in the dipping sauce, giving you the perfect excuse to fish around in there to retrieve them.Here's the secret kicker here everyone. The fried rice is out of control. Might be one of my most favorite fried rices anywhere, and I LOVE FRIED RICE. They hardly even mention it on the menu, as if you might well gloss over it, having enjoyed your delicious bowl of ramen, missing the opportunity to stuff yourself to gills because you can't stop eating this delicious fucking rice.Also, the ice in the drinks are those little round crunchy ice-ball things. And honestly, who doesn't love that?
Serena A.}Calgary, Canada}845}205}3597}18}4}4/14/2015}I woke up with a sore throat and stuffy face. I was sick, so someone who cares about me took me here. We started off with the oolong tea. It was perfect. The waiter brought me a glass of water with ice. I asked him to bring me water with no ice, to which he kindly obliged. TThe soup came out. It was great. My soup had half an egg with a soft yolk, a large to medium size sheet of seaweed, spinach, shrimp wonton and some Ramen noodles in chicken broth.The broth cleared my sinuses well. I felt better after the tea and the soup. I think my favorite part though, was the toilet. This toilet was a Cadillac of toilets. It had heated seats, two speeds of butt washer and a dryer.This was a great little joint. Had a great time. The service was good and so was the soup. And the toilet.
Anna K.}Manhattan, NY}121}73}138}-1}5}4/5/2015Updatedreview}Great price with great food for a maximum value! It's worth your money and mouthwatering! It's a small place with most of the seating being a japanese style ramen counter- top. If you stand you can watch the cooks make your meal with grace and ease. The smell of the combinations of broths leaves you mouthwatering as you wait for your food. They're gyoza which is a pork and garlic filled dumpling is the best thing you'll ever eat there. The chow-Han - I get the vegetable version is full of flavor although a bit salty. Finally they have about 6 different ramens- based upon the flavor or type of broth. And yay to vegetarians! They have a vegetarian ramen! It's full of flavor, components such as vegetables and meats, it contains the authenticity of ramen made in Japan as well as the large portion which fills your belly leaving you warm, content and makes you want to fall into a food coma. The average price for a ramen is 10-12 dollars! It's worth the buck!
Yuan Y.}New York, NY}425}56}113}-1}5}4/3/2015}their pork buns are great!!! you get 2 small ish ones but worth during happy hour. I also got the wonton soup side and it was okay but could be better. my friend got the shoyu ramen and it was pretty good too
yuwi s.}New York, NY}7}128}2}-1}2}3/25/2015Updatedreview}Good ramen, very clean & flavorful broth. All broths are chicken-based. Noodles are a good texture, and prices are great!  It's a classic, good, Japanese ramen place. But the service is AWFUL. I am at the restaurant at 10:30 on a Wed night, and there are maybe 5-6 people here w/ me having a late-night dinner. (The restaurant closes at 11:45 tonight). There are two waiters and it takes 5 min for my order to be taken. The food comes quickly, but I have no chopsticks. Once I'm done, the wrong check is delivered. I alone definitely did not have 2 bowls of ramen, and 2 appetizers. Seriously, how do you mess that up. And THEN, 10-15 min pass before they take my cash. This is infuriating. I am insanely disappointed.
Tom R.}Plymouth Township, MI}1}5}0}-1}5}3/22/2015}I have tried the Miso and the Shoyu Ramen and they are both outstanding.  Both have  flavorful stock, and with great body.  Every thing is fresh and delicious, and the roasted pork is particularly good.  This is a lot like one of the better Ramen shops in Tokyo.  And it's the best Ramen I have ever had in the States.  I stop here every time I'm in New York.
Brian G.}Los Angeles, CA}49}56}4}-1}5}3/22/2015}Great neighborhood ramen spot. But if you ask me, it's the pork fried rice that steals the show.
Nilsa L.}Brooklyn, NY}56}262}285}18}3}3/16/2015}I had walked by here with a fellow elite yelper on a cold post-birthday celebration and said we would come back to try the place out. There were two we were interested in (Rai Rai Ken and Iron Sushi) and decided on Rai Rai Ken. Although, not busy, we decided to sit at the bar which they conveniently had a coat rack by the wall and hooks under the bar for bags. We soon got the menu and my friend got the plum wine. The waitress emphasized that the plum wine is sweet. So when it was my turn to order, I decided to get the plum wine too. I figured it would like sweet like moscato but just with plum flavor. Hmmm, I was wrong. It tasted like really bad cough syrup. My antibiotics for strep throat last year tasted better. I took a few sips hoping that the taste would settle in, but it never did. That's $3 (happy hour price) down the drain. Thankfully, my dinner partner asked for water for both of us. Water never tasted so good! Haha.I remembered really good review for the pork buns so we got an order of that. It came out pretty quickly and true to the reviews, the pork bun was very good. The meat was fall apart good. We then got the Shoyu and I think it was $10 which was not a bad price and it came with half a soft boiled egg. The only thing is that there was only one piece of chasu. I would preferred at least 2 pieces with a regular order. Otherwise, the noodles were cooked well and wasn't too salty. I had wanted dessert but the only dessert they served is almond tofu. Since I'm not a fan of almond extract, I skipped it. One thing I did notice is that the people who did the cooking were mostly Mexican/Hispanic. There were two Asian looking people (Japnese/Chinese?) coming in and out of the kitchen, but I think they did minimum cooking. Not that it's a deal breaker, but I guess it's a NY thing.
A J.}Manhattan, NY}118}20}3}-1}4}3/13/2015}Came here on one of the COLDEST days in NYC. We were seated immediately, the server was super nice and helpful!Had some happy hour beer ($4? I think?) which was very affordable.We had miso ramen, soyu ramen w/ some pork buns. DELICIOUS! Miso ramen was a bit salty, but it depends on your tastebuds...Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back.Personally, it just feels more of a Chinese place to me for some reason, but ramen tasted excellent, so who cares the owner is Chinese or Japanese ;)
Victor R.}Brooklyn, NY}33}49}1}-1}4}3/7/2015}The curry ramen is the only thing keeping me warm this winter. It's the East Village so expect a tight space.Come here for the happy hour and get gyoza dumplings & pork buns for under $10.Hit the bank first though. It's cash only and the ATM outside is always broken.
Tiffany L.}Brooklyn, NY}302}532}429}18}4}2/25/2015}decent broth, i had the shoyu ramen with added corn. noodles are bouncy and the pork was nice and fatty. we also had pork buns to start with which was pretty good as well. overall, a pretty great ramen place that's laid back with quick service.
Louis R.}Jersey City, NJ}2260}2003}789}-1}4}2/20/2015}Back in college, I spent all my hard-earned cabbage on food.  And by food, I mean cases of Natural Lite cans.So for food, I bought 4-5 tons of ramen...for like $0.15/ton.This ain't college, and ramen be like $10-14 ballz up in hea.WHAT?!  Yeah, y'all yuppies be feelin this sht.Thank goodness, my gangsta' roll can choke a donkey...because the curry ramen and miso ramen were OFF THE CHAINS.  Def worth the money.  Ish be spicy as hell...like my boxer-briefs were soaked from sweat.  Yeah, I'm classy like that.Of Note:  I heard a patron say, "Damn, look at all the cute white chicks, eating, up in this bissh."Wait....that was me.
Mayla C.}WOODHAVEN, NY}21}4}4}-1}1}2/18/2015}Not the worse ramen place but it could get better. Soup was very salty. I had the soy sauce chicken broth and it was drinking hot soy sauce. My husband had the me so soup which was extra salty. So be prepared to drink a gallon of water. You've been warned!
Jamie S.}Manhattan, NY}0}20}0}-1}1}2/16/2015}Waited over 2 hours for delivery.  Food arrived freezing (of course), greasy and disgusting.  NEVER ordering from here again, should have listened to all the bad reviews.
Ting S.}Manhattan, NY}155}26}24}-1}4}2/9/2015}People complaining about the service and sloppiness of the appetizers need to get out and go to shitty, mediocre places like Ippudo. Rai Rai Ken is designed after a kind of "fast food"/relaxed ramen drinking atmosphere. Don't expect anything exceptional in terms of service. I've come here multiple times and they've never disappointed. Their chashu is amazing, fatty grilled pork that I throw on top of my oily mapo ramen. Anyone who hadn't had their mapo ramen also hadn't truly experienced Rai Rai. I've had mapo in MANY places, and theirs takes the cake for Japanese mapo. TONS of meat, perfect consistency tofu, and truly spicy sweet flavour. Their noodles and wontons are super yummy as well!Tl;dr Step 1: Get the mapodon or mapo ramen (soft noodles for me) Step 2: Thank me. Step 3: Indulge in the addiction.
Jun Y.}Queens, NY}116}33}0}-1}1}2/4/2015}Not good... There are better ramen nearby... I'd rather eat instant ramen.. Or even wait 2 hours for better ramen.We waited half an hour for this place.
Monica H.}Philadelphia, PA}98}183}585}18}1}1/31/2015}I'd skip this place. I asked if there was a table other than being seated by the bar because it was cold by the door. The guy says no.. We sit down by the bar. Another couple walks in, same thing. She asks for a table other than the bar.. She gets--table in the back.. WTH?On to the food. Pork bun was poorly made. One of our buns had such a small piece of pork, I literally thought it didn't have one!!!! And that dipping sauce? Could they be any more skimpy?? I couldn't even dip my bun in it nor could it be poured onto the bun! (Pls see pic)Wonton ramen. At first i thought it was some sorta super size wonton given the size of the skin that was floating in my bowl. Wrong... It was wontonS that didn't even have a full bite of meat (Again, see pic. And no, i didn't break the wonton.. What you see in the pic, was exactly wat i got in my bowl). Ridiculous!Would I be back? Absolutely not. There's way too many ramen shops to eat at in NY.. This one? Thanks. But no thanks.
Mike D.}Manhattan, NY}0}46}0}-1}4}1/25/2015}No ramen in soho. Little if none in west village. Not a huge fan of the one near NYU. This spot is probably my favorite takeout joint for ramen. Good for casual, quick dine in too
Mary F.}Brooklyn, NY}104}452}935}-1}2}1/11/2015}Food: Eh, the ramen is decent. It's a bit better than Momofuku, which isn't good as well. I ordered the Mabo Ramen and the Veggie Ramen. Mabo ramen tasted like mapo tofu (spicy grounded beef broth). The idea is genius but the outcome failed. Tasted weird and it didn't match. Veggie ramen is the better of the two. There's nothing noteworthy about it. Wished they used fresh ingredients instead of canned stuff (like the corn).Ambiance: Noisy. Service: Service wasn't great. Waiter was hardly there. I had an empty cup most of the time and it's not because I drink fast. Also, TEA IS NOT FREE. REFILLS ARE NOT FREE EITHER. Can you let us know that it's not free waiter??The Bottom Line: Won't be back even if they have stamp cards. There's better ramen places around here even if it's a longer wait.
Susanna L.}New York, NY}312}67}144}-1}3}12/29/2014}We came here for a "Ramen Social" event for a large group of 20 or so and food came out pretty quick. Service was top-notch as well! The ramen is decent but can't compare to higher end joints like Ippudo or Hide-Chan (the latter still #1 in my book) because it is not striving to be one of those ramen places and it would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.However, for the price point and almost no wait time - quite wonderful if you're looking for a quick ramen fix. Appetizers were also tasty and the ramen broth was a bit on the salty end but overall passable in my book. Toppings were great as well. Overall, a good place to get a quick ramen fix but as a reminder, this place is non-comparable to the other ramen locations.
Wenfan C.}Columbus, OH}271}63}4}-1}4}12/27/2014}Small but lovely Ramen place! Loved their Mapo Ramen and Pork Buns! They are also probably among the most popular ones in the house. Rai Rai Ken has a small menu but menu items are refined and classic. This place would be a great place to grab your dinner in a rush after a whole day of work!
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}2}12/25/2014}This was on my ramen list, which I would like to think is very extensive as it's compiled from cheap lists, best lists, must go lists....So I can only give this place 2 stars based on the fact that I have had so much ramen to count and this has been one of the most disappointing places I can think of in the city. I usually get miso and so I got the miso with bamboo shoots here. The only reason why it is still open is purely due to convenience in its location. I could make better ramen than this myself. I almost wanted to send it back after the first bite. The broth tasted like leftover soup and the ramen bland. I felt like I was eating plastic....I really don't mean to be harsh but have the ppl in the kitchen tasted what they put in front of customers? Although the ramen was terrible I would suggest trying their buns. Oddly good and comparable to Bassanova or Chuko. Only reason why I gave it 2 stars.
Peter H.}Berkley, MI}98}104}0}-1}4}12/24/2014}Really solid little ramen place.  Not a lot else to get on the menu (the gyoza were pretty good), and the space is pretty basic, but they have some good ramen.The shoyu I had was very good, and the shio tastes nice and clean, too, but the curry ramen really seemed particularly flavor packed.  I'd probably go in that direction if I came back.  And the noodles had that nice chew that every solid ramen place should be able to produceThe toppings were all well executed, too.  The chashu/pork was fall-apart-delicious, the egg was nicely marinated, the fish cake was delicious, and so on.Overall, definitely the kind of place that everyone wishes they had in their neighborhood.  I'd advise getting there early, but obviously a lot of people seem to feel that way and the place (while bigger than it was down the street at their last location) is NOT large.  There was a pretty big line forming when we left around 1:00pm on a Saturday afternoon.
Jasmine S.}New York, NY}10}66}8}-1}4}12/24/2014}My husband and I went here last week just to get out of the house while our 2 year old was away and I have to say that I'm in love. The prices are great, the portions for ramen are excellent. The staff is very welcoming and attentive, it is a bit of a tight squeeze but we made it work. I had the Shoyu ramen (without egg) which tasted delicious and the broth is sooo full of flavor. My only complaint is that the pork buns were overpriced in my opinion, you get two medium sized pork buns for $8 bucks, I've had better at Bao.
A Z.}New York, NY}62}404}26}-1}4}12/18/2014Updatedreview}Hi rai rai ken. Thank you for your comment and reminder. I gave you 3 1/2 stars but I HAVE tried your pork buns and they are SO good. I admittedly order pork buns every chance I get and yours are perfectly cooked with great sauce. Highly recommended.
Amanda I.}Manhattan, NY}652}129}72}-1}2}12/17/2014}Overall meh ramen. I got the shio ramen with roast pork and it was just unimpressive. The roast pork was the best part, but Ramen Takumi's on University is leagues better. Otherwise, the broth was not so great-- it tasted like chicken soup instead of ramen broth, and the additions, particularly the bamboo shoots, were subpar as well. The service was fine, but it was not the classy and professional service I've come to expect with Japanese places. The decor is cute though, I'll give them that. All in all, I left feeling like I could've done my wallet and belly one better. If given the choice, I'd choose Ramen Takumi over this place any day.
mollusk h.}New York, NY}0}91}0}-1}4}12/14/2014}An East Village classic.No frills, good and cheap.The staff are attentive and quick.The happy hour(4-7) rules: $3 drafts/$4 pork buns
Mike T.}New York, NY}558}184}164}18}3}12/5/2014}Food is good but they have to do something about the front door.  The interior space is not very large and the door is heavy glass and closes very slowly.  Customers and the delivery guy are in and out of the door constantly.  I never took off my coat!  Constant gusts of freezing cold air.
Elisabeth C.}Summit, NJ}341}377}37}-1}4}12/3/2014}This place is really small and it tends to fill up on cold days around dinner time, so go early. The ramen is very good. I have had cold ramen and regular hot ramen there in the past but now that I am gluten free I was happy to find that I can have rice noodles instead of ramen. It's really just as good- I did not feel like I was missing anything! This time I had miso ramen. OMG I was so jazzed because it was incredibly delicious. Regular ramen is good, but the miso ramen was really something special- it was really different and I especially liked the pieces of crispy garlic and shredded chicken! They both added such a nice flavor and texture. DELICIOUS. Also they have a really weird japanese style commode in the bathroom and the wallpaper in the bathroom is awesome also.
Kevin M.}FRESH MEADOWS, NY}3}20}0}-1}4}11/26/2014}Shio ramen was pretty good =] Pork buns where pretty nice 2 =D, if only they take credit cards = / id go there everyday
Chyna S.}New York, NY}188}16}13}-1}3}11/15/2014}Ended up going here b/c Ippudo was a 2 hour wait. I ordered gyoza which was delish  but shio ramen was just ok. Great deal if you're here for happy hour specials til 7pm. $3 sapporos and $6 large sakes. Otherwise, I rather pay a little extra for Ippudo. Servers are friendly!
Erin M.}Seattle, WA}417}596}1806}-1}3}11/14/2014}My aunt and I got two bowls of ramen:  Shoyu Ramen and the spicy pork ramen. The spicy pork ramen has broth that is on the thicker side. If I were to go back I would get the Shoyu ramen because the broth is tasty and not thick. The bowls are a generous size. I visited the restaurant two days ago, and the highlight was the dessert. The almond tofu dessert was sweet, but not too sweet. It was the size of a cup and a great way to end the meal!
Matt V.}New York, NY}4}2}0}-1}5}11/12/2014}The miso ramen is the go to dish here. Packed with vegis and optional chicken. Its delicious and they give huge servings. Well worth the $11.
Andrew T.}New York, NY}19}67}5}-1}2}11/4/2014}Verdict: Not as good as the good old days.So this place moved a few years ago, from a charming hole in the wall that was practically the alleyway between two East Village brownstones, to its current, rather festive location. And I think their chefs have not passed on their ramen skills to the current crop of cooks.Their broth used to be practically unctuous in the most appetizing way imaginable, when a diner might lift the noodles out of the broth and find it glistening beautifully in the light, a deep and thoroughly rich aroma. Now? They just put a few squeezes of oil into the finished dish and serve it up. No nicely coated noodles. A much thinner aroma and broth. And to top it off, the pork gyoza is practically a joke (where is the pork in this thing?!).
Tom G.}New York, NY}1}31}0}-1}5}10/30/2014}My Girlfriend & her parents have been coming here for nearly 10 years. And jesus christ - I can see why. Fantastic ramen, I had Shoya Ramen with Pork and it was to die for. The iced tea is also very mellow and nice, a perfect accompaniment for a salty broth.Atmosphere is tight and cosy, and is everything you'd expect. Staff are fun and friendly.
Laura O.}Queens, NY}288}499}23}18}4}10/29/2014}Why is it that when I write reviews about ramen places, I always, without a doubt, end up craving ramen? I am doing so now. This thing of yogurt that I'm eating just isn't cutting it.My friend brought me here for an impromptu meal last Saturday evening. We were seated immediately at the counter, although the small spot was otherwise pretty crowded. I opted for the shoyu (Soy sauce based noodle soup topped w/ bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed, and scallion). My friend, who is a bit of a Rai Rai veteran, correctly ordered the curry ramen. She said she also got the shoyu during her first visit but got food envy when she tasted her friend's, and thus has ordered the curry ever since. I, too, experienced this food envy when trying it... it was so good. The broth actually tasted quite like Indian curry to me and I got to have quite a bit of it since my friend generally doesn't finish her broth. I did have the noodles, the pork and some of the broth from my shoyu bowl and thought it was pretty quality stuff. But the curry was definitely better. Have I mentioned the curry?We also both ordered some plum wine since it was like $3 per glass for happy hour. It wasn't bad but was extra sweet, even for plum wine.I'd also like to implore you to check out the extra exciting Japanese toilet in the bathroom, even if you don't have to go. Its presence is a nice "touch".
Harue J.}Manhattan, NY}12}261}31}18}2}10/14/2014Updatedreview}This place was not better at all.  We only went there since our go-to place closed :-)The broth of our shio ramen was so salty without much flavor.  The crammed tables, spotty service and less than mediocre ramen.  It's not terrible like Terakawa, but is still meh.
Frank K.}Wilton, CT}16}27}90}-1}4}10/13/2014}'Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!!!! I Love Rai Rai Ken!!!' - cries my 8 yr daughter!We've been coming here for over a decade, so authentic and good and comforting that I had my 40th here!Consistently and reliably delicious, it never tries to be anything it's not, and sticks to comforting the hunger of its loyal patrons.Rich broth, tender pork cutlets, chewy ramen, the perfect fried rice, all for a very, very reasonable price. Only downside in the recent expansion; the loud Japanese game show type music that ruins an otherwise delightful experience like a fly that just won't leave you alone.
Jane C.}JACKSON HTS, NY}0}13}1}-1}2}10/4/2014}I came here for ramen and I was very displeased! No flavor! Although their  pork bun was good
Alex D.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}4}10/3/2014}Good food, great value for your money. The ramen was wonderful, the noodles may have been a touch overcooked but the broth was delicious, the pork was tender and flavorful, and at these prices I'm not going to complain too much. Cash only, but again, at these prices that's totally fine. Service was efficient, not much in the way of atmosphere, I suggest sitting at the counter so you can watch the cooks. A really solid, no-frills ramen shop that I'm looking forward to visiting again, lots of stuff on the menu I want to try.
Katrina L.}Manhattan, NY}175}378}98}-1}3}9/15/2014Updatedreview}I was quite disappointed by my subsequent visits. The soup was not rich, but watery. Overall the ramen was unimpressive and bland.
Bryan D.}New York, NY}46}45}9}-1}2}9/15/2014}i liked pre-op rai rai ken. it had a nice dingy ramen cowboy saloon feel. went after the make over, and just can't get into the vibe or the ramen. noodles were average and broth wasn't memorable.
Jen S.}Melbourne, Australia}172}176}4994}-1}2}8/27/2014}The food just wasn't that good.  Arrived here with friends starving for dinner and ready to eat just about anything after a day in the city. We all ordered the vegetarian miso ramen based on our server's recommendation and her description of it coming with "a lot" of vegetables.  I'm a vegetarian, so my meals are regularly heavy on the vegetables.  When the food arrived we discovered that the term "a lot" is apparently relative.  (I'm thinking this is only in comparison to the other dishes at Rai Rai Ken.) But my real complaint wasn't the quantity, it was the quality. The food tasted cheap.  But not in that guilty pleasure 2am taco truck kind of way.  It was more like "this pile of corn in my soup tastes canned."  I also didn't enjoy the flavour of the broth.  In these types of soup dishes, the broth is such an important component to the overall flavour of the dish. The miso seemed salty enough, but beyond that it wasn't that interesting or satisfying. The $11 ramen (plus additional tax and tip) wasn't worth it for what we received.  If I wanted uninspired food with low-quality ingredients, I'd make it at home!  (Though, the 20% tip was fine, as the service was decent.)As one of my dining companions put it, "I wouldn't choose to come back here.  There are just too many good options in New York."
Ruby L.}New York, NY}122}238}634}-1}3}8/20/2014}came here for a late night snack after the movies. we ordered the pork buns, shoyu ramen, and miso ramen (there was also happy hour!)the pork buns were pretty good (can't compare to ippudo's). if you had to decide on which ramen to get -- get the shoyu ramen. their miso ramen was a tad too thick (almost stew like) which did not sit well in my stomach.
Violet C.}Washington, DC}0}3}0}-1}3}8/19/2014}It was pretty good. The ramen was well cooked but my broth was a bit on the salty side. The food came quickly, so I do not really know how well the service is. They were nice and polite though. Overall, I would recommend it if you are craving something quick and on the lighter side.
Charlene J.}Atlanta, GA}21}93}5}-1}5}8/17/2014}I stumbled upon this place years ago when I started going to the Russian Steam Room.  I wanted something light but filling and smelled the aroma's coming outta this place.  I have been hooked every since.  Get the Curry Ramen Soup with toasted garlic.  Its the bomb.  Eat the noodles there because they don't travel well.  The dumplings are tasty as hell to.  Love them!
Anthony W.}Manhattan, NY}0}102}56}-1}3}8/15/2014Updatedreview}A follow-up lunch visit. Appetizer - Pork buns. Two, on the small side but very good. Hoisin sauce instead of the usual mayonaise with a serving of crunchy chili oil.Ramen - Classic Shoyu.Broth - Good. Not as salty as some. I know the salt is bad for you, but I do miss it in my ramen.Toppings - Ordered the extra chasu. Nice and fatty. Standard fare. Fatty thick slices.Memna (yum, thick and tangy), 1/2 egg (nicely soft boiled), scallions, spinach (?), nori (yea!) and the obligatory fish cake.A good classic bowl. No risks taken in the flavor or toppings. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Celebrity ramen spotting, as Keizo Shimamato stopped by for lunch.I'd visit agin to try the mabo, (spicy ramen with tofu) which seemed pretty popular. If its good enough for Keizo, it's good enough for me to give it a shot.
Bob B.}Manhattan, NY}0}128}0}-1}3}8/9/2014}Great little local Japanese noodle plus shop.  Ramen is good.  Pork buns are fantastic.  Prices are reasonable and attitude is New York.
Deli Llama K.}Brooklyn, NY}16}106}60}-1}4}8/6/2014}This is my third visit to my Rai Rai Ken, and I'm already looking forward to the fourth. What an awesome little noodle shop! You can't go wrong with the Miso Ramen....but my personal fave has gotta be the Curry Ramen, excellent flavors, not too spicy, but packed with tastiness. Really though, make sure you try the Pork Bao...at lunch they're 2 for $4, and they nearly steal the show. Crispy pork shavings, a bit of lettuce and Japanese mayo, with a freaking awesome fluffy bun covering. The dried chilies in oil that come with it are the PERFECT compliment to these sweet and savory bao, and if you're not into spicy stuff, grow a pair and human up...you've gotta try it!Lastly, the staff is always friendly, attentive but not overbearing, and the ambiance is simple and unassuming.
Celia Z.}New York, NY}245}307}747}-1}4}7/27/2014}The only reason this place is getting four stars is because of the comfort it provides as a drunken food place.I came here around 1am after four hours of binge eating and drinking for yet another round of food.  The gyoza was delicious and greasy and most perfect for the late night.  The Ramen was surprisingly light, and while the noodles were not of the best quality, the combination of deep flavor within the broth, the piping hot bowl, the delicious egg and meat, and my drunken confusion that made the bowl ridiculously wonderful.My friend ordered the fried noodles, which, for a lack of better word, was absolutely disgusting.Sketchy, cash-only, hole-in-the-wall place that fostered a surprising sense of comfort.Drunken memories (or lack thereof) are some of the best ones, and it's the places that help shape them that deserve to one-up the rating they truly deserve.
Lindsay P.}Manhattan, NY}13}9}0}-1}3}7/21/2014}In the East Village where excellent ramen restaurants are sprouting like weeds, service might well be a criteria on choosing a place. In that case Rai Rai Ken might not be the spot you choose. Delicious, yes, but the service was a little slower than what you would expect at the early hour we went, and when I asked if I could drink my non-alcoholic beer (since they don't sell that) I was told no outside beverages could be consumed there.  Fair enough.  I thought perhaps the manager might allow it, but when he came to the table, I was not prepared for his rude, angry tone.  Is this anyway to treat a customer?I ain't sayin', I'm jes sayin'.....there are a lot of good ramen places.
Joojoo J.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}2}-1}4}7/20/2014Updatedreview}Retracting mapo tofu approval-- very inconsistent.  Sometimes good, other times there's way too much "gravy" that's grossly gelatinously gooey.  Too bad.
Mick R.}Manhattan, NY}49}70}2}-1}2}7/14/2014}I used to go here often, when it was located two storefronts away.  Maybe 10 years ago when I lived in E. Village.  Back then, it was just a small bar served by Japanese cooks sporting Kamikaze bandanas.   It was decent back then, but now it's morphed into a weird wonton soup style ramen product.  The Shoyu broth is wonton soup.  Really.  The cooks also aren't wearing kamikaze bandanas anymore and they're not even Japanese.
Ursula W.}Weehawken, NJ}23}9}16}-1}5}6/30/2014}Tempted to go here,tonight,even tho,it's hot outside...that's how amazing thus ramen is... Chicken miso ramen & pork buns. That's it. I dare U to challenge me,on this...Cash only. Staff is great & U MUST check out the bathroom...
David N.}Brooklyn, NY}121}573}801}18}4}6/11/2014}The plethora of ramen shops in NYC is probably equal to the amount of Dunkin Donuts shops. You can almost find one in every borough. Rai Rai Ken is tucked along a street full of other Japanese eateries. The bright open shop with wood interior and bar is pretty standard setup. The broth here is good. It isn't so fatty like other ramen shops but keeps plenty of flavor. We ordered the vegetarian ramen and the special Tsukemen. It was a nice change from the noodle in the broth and nice for a warm day with the cold noodles. The pork was also nicely grilled with minimal fat along with the other condiments. As far as ramen goes and I'm no expert but compared to others I've eaten in the city Rai Rai Ken is certainly on my list of good noodle shops for a casual dinner.
Herman S.}Los Angeles, CA}27}45}27}-1}5}6/8/2014}I don't know why this place doesn't have more stars. Great shio and great shoyu ramen. Cha Han was excellent too!Good service. Very clean and comfortable.
Esa A.}New York, NY}0}18}0}-1}3}6/4/2014}My sister really wanted ramen for dinner and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to give Rai Rai Ken a try. It was relatively empty since we were dining early but the place is pretty spacious and clean. We were seated promptly and the waiter was very cordial. We ordered the pork buns, gyoza, shoyu ramen, and the vegetarian ramen. The food arrived really quickly but it was just mediocre. The pork buns were pretty decent but the gyozas were terrible - the filling was overly mushy. The ramen wasn't anything special but it wasn't terrible either. I would recommend Minca or Ivan Ramen for better Japanese food.
Daphne M.}New York, NY}122}43}21}-1}2}6/3/2014}Have been very disappointed in the Ramen ... You moved to a new place & left the authenticity behind.
Hayoung B.}New York, NY}21}25}51}-1}4}5/27/2014}I love rai rai ken! I've tried everything on the menu! You really can't go wrong with either the shoyu or the shio ramen. Just remember to order the ramen with less salt! Also the hand made gyoza and pork buns are a must try!
Marissa B.}Tampa, FL}0}4}0}-1}2}5/23/2014}It is so salty! We had the mapo ramen and the miso ramen, both lack the thick rich broth flavor but very salty! For my mapo ramen, it just tasted like instant noodles in spicy salty soup I made at home with ground pork and lots of scallion... The price is not bad, but still it doesn't justify the mediocrity of the ramen...
Luis B.}Brooklyn, NY}112}277}237}18}3}5/19/2014}this place is small and serves its purpose. I had spicy noodles with tofu and it was good, a bit oily but whatevs. Happy hour of $5 sake and appetizers didn't hurt.
T S.}Brooklyn, NY}0}8}1}-1}4}5/17/2014}Been a big fan of Rai Rai Ken for years.Would prefer their old location with cozy limited seating. Their new location is bigger but not as authentic. When I first tried the ramen at the new location 2 years ago, I thought they had lost it. It just did not taste right. Still good but not delicious. Been back few more times, still not impressed with the taste.Went back a few weeks ago, the ramen was DELICIOUS! My taste buds said WOW! The broth has an authentic taste and is really complex. New chef???! Keep it up Rai Rai Ken. Move back to your old small space if you can. If you can't, just cram me into your corner seat--so I can reminisce about the good old days...
BB Q.}East Coast, Australia}0}45}1}-1}3}5/16/2014}Forgettable, but when you need your fix...you need your fix. Cheap, yummy, and no wait.
Kriztenne M.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}17}10}5}-1}2}5/12/2014}Went here on a rainy night with co-workers to get some hot ramen. Didn't wait long for a table. The place was packed for a weeknight. You have an option to seat by the bar. The service was very quick. We ordered pork buns, ugh delicious and their fried rice is on point. Yum! Their gyozas are very ordinary. I ordered Shoyu ramen and it wasn't anything special, I'd still prefer Ippudo's any day minus the long wait of course. Prices are cheaper than most ramen places I've been. The location is a bit of a walk from the train station. Service was fair and please check out their restroom hahaha heated toilet seat? Pretty cool!
Olivia L.}Brooklyn, NY}160}123}209}18}3}5/8/2014}If you're looking for quick, satisfactory ramen for around $10, go to Rai Rai Ken. If you're looking for amazing ramen with rich broth and don't mind waiting in a herd of ramen foodies, head for Ippudo or Minca. I came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm with my sister and unlike the other ramen shops around the East Village, there wasn't an hour wait.Food: We ordered the pork buns, curry ramen and shoyu ramen. (Just missed the happy hour special that ends at 7pm. Pork buns and gyoza would've been $3-4 instead) Pork buns were good, but the homemade spicy pepper oil was sweet?? Curry broth was tasty, shoyu broth was good... but it's missing that rich flavor that Totto, Ippudo and Minca are famous for. Their pork wasn't good at all... kind of dry and tasteless. Noodle texture was great and boiled just right though.Decor: Spacious and clean, you won't be knocking elbows or avoiding knees here. Noodle bar's got hooks so you don't have to juggle bags or jackets. Plenty of tables going down the right side of the restaurant. Restroom was very clean and they have a heated Japanese toilet!Service: Very quick, waiter seated us, took orders, and got our food to us in less than 20 minutes.
Chris C.}Newburgh, NY}1}16}0}-1}4}5/3/2014}Great soup for a realistic price! The service is alway quick. Broth is solid, noodles are average and toppings are tasty! I always get the Miso which is amazing, however the shredded chicken on top always manages to be dry. So I put it at the bottom to eat last. Have been coming here since before their remodel, nice to have a little elbow room now!
helen l.}Manhattan, NY}7}21}3}-1}3}4/26/2014}Great afforfable japanese ramen if you need a quick fix. The only thing I would complain about is how salty the broth is which is kind of typical for ramen but I just couldnt finish it. The resturant atmosphere is nice and quite and small/cozy. They have a good variety of broth bases and some basic appetizers. For a party of 4, we only paid $50 total
Drew N.}Manhattan, NY}1}13}0}-1}3}4/20/2014}Great bathroom. Ramen was decent. Not a lot of pork. But seriously, that bathroom though. Heated seat, need I say more?
D Z.}New York, NY}3}368}10}-1}3}4/19/2014}I used to love the ramen here. But recently, it has disappointed and not as good.
M. C.}Matawan, NJ}2}12}0}-1}4}4/12/2014}The soups here hit the spot when a spot needs hitting.  The sides are nice snacks if you don't want to fill up on a bowl of soup.  I preferred the ambiance of the pre-renovated restaurant but the new space adds more seating, which was a b*tch in the old joint, especially when you had to wait 15 minutes for a seat in the rain.  Now the yuppy/hipster crowd (y'all birds of the same feather anyway) are flocking to this spot and ruining the vibe with their loud speak, sh*tty attitude, and air of entitlement.  The service is decent when it wants to be but they treat regulars like we are extended family.  Still CASH ONLY, which is the only draw back.
Projectshave L.}Jersey City, NJ}0}134}0}-1}2}4/11/2014}Luke warm broth, noodles had a strange smell, pork was overcooked and chewy, broth was bland. The ramen fad in NYC has brought us many excellent ramen places. Rai Rai is not among them.
Joanna N.}New York, NY}832}408}1948}18}3}4/10/2014}Had dinner here this evening with Paul about 6:30. The place was still relatively empty..except that there was a whole film crew by the bar filming a segment for some travel food show I presume. The pair being filmed were not tv personalities that I recognized, though. However, the cameras did pan over by me at some point (tried to look natural) so if you see me on tv, let me know what show! :)Anyways, we split the pork buns to start. I ordered the Mabo and Paul ordered the Shoyu. The pork buns were good! They kind of skimped on the pork, though. The mabo ramen was just okay. The broth was really hearty, thick and had a mild kick. The tofu and ground beef were definitely tasty but I didn't like the consistency of the noodles! They didn't taste too fresh. I ended up finishing it anyway since I was starving but left most of the broth. May come back to try the other options sometime (Paul said his shoyu was pretty good) but am in no hurry to do so.
C T.}New York, NY}0}3}6}-1}2}4/9/2014}I recommend the Shio and Shoyu perhaps Mabo if you are feeling a little adventurous and want something different. My advice is to stay away from the Miso ramen and the tsukemen. Pork buns and menma are also not recommended. Shio and Shoyu are indeed classic, this is a good place to go for that. The Miso has a very peanuty taste and the shredded chicken did not impress me. Mabo has a lot of ingredients and is quite spicy. A good thing to try but not something to reorder. Tsukemen has a strong fishy flavor (seafood and pork) and the noodles have a lightly squeezed lemon tang to them. Bonus is the stamps you get for each bowl of ramen you order! Free ramen after your 10th bowl.
Michelle P.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}24}62}0}-1}4}4/8/2014}Mabo spicy ramen really hits the spot on cold, cold nights. It's right, on so many comfort levels -- imagine creamy hamburger helper and tender tofu miso soup, mingled together in a harmonious bowl of steaming yum. Behold it's healing powers, this Asian version of chicken noodle soup. Yes, every bite makes me feel better. As far as snazzy ramen goes, their Mabo is tops.
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}3}4/2/2014}Nice lunch deal, but forgettable ramen. Very salty broth for the shio, which is supposed to be salty, but still. The noodles were thin and not very chewy. Left with a heavy feeling in my stomach, which is not necessarily good. The pork bun was decent though, if a little heavy on the mayo.
Kenley O.}Manhattan, NY}23}51}51}-1}2}4/1/2014}Came early evening on a Friday night, sat up at the counter. Quick service, fairly attentive. Pork buns were very good. Did not care for my ramen dish-- ground meat with tofu.. The consistency of the broth was funky with a clear looking sauce. No flavor whatsoever! I ended up eating the whole bowl only because I hadn't eaten all day. Been to other great inexpensive ramen places. Won't be back.
Ashlee A.}Manhattan, NY}24}18}4}-1}4}3/26/2014}Love their ramen! Servers are alaways very friendly.  Lunch time is the best to go cause once it dinner time damn over flow of people and a long wait~ I love their crispy garlic on top of the ramen and their sliced roast pork just melts in your mouth. :D It good place if you want some tasty ramen.
Sarah K.}New York, NY}209}29}4}-1}4}3/22/2014}Chinese style Japanese ramen. 3 stars for the food, add one star for reasonable pricing and comfort factor. This is uncomplicated food.
Jocelyn K.}Jersey City, NJ}443}810}4544}18}4}3/20/2014}Delicious broth, lots of meat and toppings, good noodles. Overall good bowl of ramen without the long wait of Ippudo or Totto. The place is small but we didn't have to wait long for a table to open up. I jordered the Shoyu Ramen. It comes with your standard toppings: Chashu, Menma, Naruto, piece of dried seaweed, and soft-boiled egg.  The Chashu was thick and really soaked up the broth well. And wow that soft-boiled egg. I could have eaten a dozen of them. Maybe it's because they use a smaller bowl, but the ramen here seems like there's more components to it than Ippudo's without needing to pay extra for additional toppings. Pork buns are decent. Could do without the mayo though since I dislike that stuff and instead of pickled sour vegetables they use lettuce. Still prefer the original Taiwanese guabao than the Japanese rendition of pork belly buns.
Renzo A.}Woodbridge, CT}2}3}0}-1}4}3/12/2014}One if NY's first ramen shop, Rai Rain forgoes the glitz and style of higher end shops for classic style and charm.
Elizabeth S.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}3/11/2014}I wanted to love this place, but after the food poisoning I had yesterday, I will NEVER be back.  My husband and I both had the pork buns and miso ramen and the two of us have never been sicker.  Do not come here!
Philippe C.}Manhattan, NY}1}54}18}-1}4}3/10/2014}Food was ok. I personally didn't like the flavors that much. Probably won't be back, but worth checking out if you are in the area.
Mali N.}New York, NY}3}15}3}-1}4}3/8/2014}Favorite place after Momofuku. Pork buns are insanely good. Staff can be a little slow, but not terrible.
Christina F.}Brooklyn, NY}95}289}11}-1}4}2/28/2014}I liked this place more when it was located in what was practically a hole in the wall--a space so small that the open kitchen made up 75% of the space, there were only 12 seats around the ramen bar, and things got intimate real fast. But despite moving to a larger spot 2 stores down, the ramen's still really good. I love that the menu is as simple as the restaurant itself, and doesn't go on for pages and pages. It doesn't offer that much more than the classics, which are easy to overlook these days. Not a fan of the Shio Ramen but the Shoyu and Miso Ramen are very good, as is the Hiyashi Chu-ka if you're into chilled noodles. Not all are. Note: It's cash only folks
Trisha D.}New York, NY}22}78}0}-1}3}2/10/2014}Waitresses were really nice and accommodating, and service was fast--we got our ramen maybe five minutes after ordering! I got the mabo ramen which was really, really good. Just the hearty meal I was looking for after skipping lunch earlier that day. It's got a bit of a kick, but nothing crazy. I don't have a high tolerance for spiciness and I had no problem.Tables are few and far between, so seating is tricky. My friends got shio ramen and weren't crazy about it.
Carl J.}Fresh Meadows, NY}80}37}44}-1}5}2/8/2014}One of the best ramen huts I've been to in good ole City of Ventures. Not too small and not too big, this place has just the right space for good conversations, even with the staff and especially with the chefs. If you do ever find yourself reserved or not talkative, you can always watch the other ramen bowls being made. But be careful, you might find yourself ordering another bowl soon enough.
Kia H.}Brooklyn, NY}72}110}142}-1}2}2/7/2014}*This review is based solely on their gyoza*I decided to come here one night because I was craving gyoza. Of course I checked yelp first and decided to come here after reading a few good reviews. It was late and they were still open, hooray! Unfortunately that was the last of my joy.The gyoza were less than desirable. The meat was very mushy and the gyoza skin was very thin. I'm glad that they have a late happy hour and the gyoza were half price. I was only able to eat 3 of the 6, it was unbearable.  I don't know if I'll return but if I do it will be for the ramen.
Henry L.}San Mateo, CA}2368}836}3037}18}3}2/5/2014}Interesting ramen place since it's quite small, the decor is old, and the cha siu ramen has very little meat, and yet, everyone always raves about how great this place is!There are plenty of better ramen places just a block away!
Raymart D.}Flushing, NY}449}208}170}18}3}2/4/2014}Years ago, I remember Rai-Rai Ken served delicious shoyu ramen with those perfectly textured noodles and nicely seasoned broth. It used to be a tiny tiny hole in the wall seating less than ten people. It was great back then but now no more.Rai-Rai Ken has expanded the amount of people it serves and has upgraded so much so that they even have a bathroom (and a clean one at that!).However, the quality of the ramen has dipped a lot. The noodles are gummier in texture and the broth is a bit dull in flavor. Plus they give you way too many noodles with little pork.The only redeeming part of Rai-Rai Ken now is that their pork fried rice is so so good. It's not greasy at all and seasoned to my liking (yay black pepper!).It's decent but there are much better ramen places in NYC.
Erna F.}San Jose, CA}69}74}51}-1}3}1/23/2014}I was starving and had planned to go to Ippudo for lunch. As usual, they said it would be 2 hours before they would sit us. There was no way I was going to wait that long! So we headed over to Rai Rai Ken that was a couple blocks away. It was highly recommended by friends.I got the combo D which includes your choice of Ramen with a side of fried rice. The fried rice was pretty good but I wasn't a big fan of my Miso Ramen. The ratio on everything was all wrong . I had too many noodles, too much corn , it lacked salt and had too many of the toasted garlic that left a  strong, bitter after taste. The steamed buns were tasty but I could've done without the mayonnaise inside. Service was good. Overall, it wasn't bad. I just think there are better ramen places in NYC and especially in this area.
Stacy G.}Weehawken, NJ}0}1}1}-1}5}1/19/2014}I'm basing this rating solely on the ice served here. I cannot express to you how fast this ice makes your water super chill. If you're looking for a place for a refreshing glass of water, this is the place to go.
Belle L.}New York, NY}168}216}181}18}4}1/15/2014}Rai Rai Ken serves a good bowl of ramen. The service is also very good. The price for the ramen is what makes it okay.
Sean E.}Brooklyn, NY}149}134}61}-1}2}1/14/2014}I'd like to give this place a 3-star rating but to be true to the grading scale, I've experienced much better ramen, even in NYC.I tried out Rai Rai on the advice of the Village Voice's "Cheap Eats" section, which rated their curry ramen highly. To me, it was a very basic curry broth, the kind you can easily make at home with squares of curry powder.The kitchen was open, and all but one of the staff were Hispanic, with only one Asian server (Chinese) to be found. Interesting operation, sub-par food. But hey, the ramen's only $10.
Damon A.}Stockholm, Sweden}68}101}114}-1}3}1/12/2014}I must admit that I walked in here not knowing exactly what food was being served here. Me being a Ramen novice - I was in unknown territory and decided to order something else before coming back with some friends that have ramen knowledge.It was around lunch time on a Saturday, not super busy, service was not out of the ordinary but friendly. I ordered the Rai Rai Ken salad that was delicious - together with some pan-fried pork/veggie dumplings. The dumplings were not very tasty. The Rai Rai Ken salad contained shredded chicken, vermilleci, cilantro (yum!), mixed veggies, jelly fish tossed in a house made sesame dressing w/ their special crunchy chili oil.The salad was $7 and the dumplings $6. Should I visit again, I'd just do the salad :)
Rowena E.}Manhattan, NY}76}48}156}-1}3}1/10/2014}As a ramen lover, this doesn't quite compare to the other popular ramen restaurants in the city, but this is the place if you want cheaper, yet pretty decent ramen without the wait.Came here on a Friday night around 8:30 with a party of 4 and was seated immediately, to our relief. We had the following:1. Mabo ramen: this is ramen with ground pork and spicy tofu. It was a pretty big hit in our table, especially among the spicy-lovers. I can't take too much spiciness myself, so I wouldn't enjoy eating a whole bowl of that. The few bites I tried were good though.2. class shoyu: good, but not the best I've had. Broth had a very strong mushroom flavor. My bowl only came with one slice of cha siew :( other places tend to give more slices. I guess that's why it was only $10 here. The cha siew they gave was also not as tender as those in other ramen spots.3. vegetarian ramen with butter and "crispy" corn: the reason why "crispy" is in quotations is because the corn was not crunchy at all. However, my friend who ordered it still liked the ramen nonethelessI wouldn't particularly choose to come back here again unless all other places are full.
Newyork F.}New York, NY}0}33}0}-1}2}1/6/2014}Service is good, howeverfood is subpar compared to many ramen places i have been to.1)shouyu ramen, spinach was not clean, had sand in it, not sure if they even washed the spinach.  broth is just soy sauce and hot water with some sesame oil, lacking richness and depth ($10 bowl of noodles is not cheap)2) lack of veggies3)wonton noodle soup, mostly skins and has a weird bitter taste to the shrimp..not good at all. broth has no flavor.
Nin A.}New York, NY}122}362}185}-1}3}12/27/2013}After giving up on the 3 hour wait at Ippudo and 1.5 hour wait at Momofuku Noodle Bar, we opted for the closest Ramen place we could find. And lo, Rai Rai Ken was there to the rescue with their ZERO line. Well it couldn't be that bad.The service was great. I hadn't eaten anything the whole day so you bet I was starving my butt off. At that point, my beguiling hunger should make anything taste heavenly delicious. And holaaa, the first bite of those PORK BUNS did not disappoint.   But while those pork buns were delicious, they were the only thing I really enjoyed during this dinner.The CHOSHU was atrocious. I have no idea why in the world they even have that on their menu. It was way too salty even for me who has a high tolerance for saltiness. The menu made it seem "popular" which was the only reason I ordered it. Totally deceiving.  And of course, the main attraction.. the ramen. I had the SHOYU RAMEN ($10). This  was my first legit ramen experience at a legit Ramen place. The broth was good but the noodles alone were meh. They were quite hard and had a greasy texture. I wasn't able to finish my bowl even though I ate nothing the whole day! I would've preferred package noodles (seriously!).  But I don't know.. maybe ramen noodles are like that everywhere? I was just totally puzzled by the whole ramen taste. I could not help asking myself.. so is this all there is to ramen??? Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I just don't like ramen in general. Or maybe I'm taking ramen way too seriously. I'll find out in my next Ramen adventure.
Ana M.}Manhattan, NY}46}96}38}-1}3}12/24/2013}Good miso, but not necessarily worth all the hype. They don't have too many vegetarian options, so I wouldn't necessarily go back, but it was all in all, a satisfying meal.
Anthony L.}OZONE PARK, NY}34}119}5}-1}5}12/20/2013}LOVE Ramen since my trips to Japan. Noodle shops on every corner. Hell, what am I talking about, I've loved ramen noodles as a kids growing up but the Japanese versions of ramen is unique. I had the handmade Gyoza and they were REALLY good. The ramen I had was just as everyone on Yelp talks about. It was delicious. I am definitely going back for more of the menu items.
Anne B.}New York, NY}0}16}0}-1}3}12/18/2013}Right off I have to say that I liked this place better at the old, narrow, steamy location. But, still is a decent place to bolt into for hot soup...as long as it is a time when there's no line. I am nearly constitutionally incapable of waiting in a line in NYC. There's always someplace else. Also, although I still like their food, I was more willing to wait at the old place -- tasted better there. No idea why, maybe some of the staff changed.My favorite is the curry ramen. Comfort food, in my neighborhood, often handy. I do wish that they hadn't done away with the hooks on the walls when they moved. Very frustrating in the winter when you've got to balance your coat on your lap (or wear it) while eating at the counter, and a single person is rarely seated at a table.
Leigh B.}Brooklyn, NY}20}8}0}-1}5}12/17/2013}Quick service, best curry ramen I've ever had, good pork buns at a really good price. Wish it wasn't cash only but whatever.
Chien-Rong C.}Pasadena, CA}47}278}65}-1}2}12/1/2013}Ramen was undercooked, broth was too oily and salty for my taste, and I highly, highly doubt they make it "over 6 hours," as they claim.  Toppings included include some bean sprouts, a piece of seaweed, half an egg and two pieces of meat. Each piece is typically meh on their own until combined with the broth, but considering how underwhelming the broth was the toppings remained quite meh.  Each bowl of ramen ranges from $10-$12 (I got shio ramen for $10), but for the quality they give you I wouldn't pay past $7 and only if i'm in the area.
Elle D.}New York, NY}153}124}21}-1}5}11/25/2013}When I try ramen places, I try hard not to compare it to the infamous Ippudo. This place definitely hits the spot. Their portions are big and will stretch out your stomach. I have visited the old location and it was horrible to eat there! You are literally sitting elbow to elbow clutched to your sides with your neighbor. I have been told that it was the more authentic feel of a Japanese ramen house.  This new joint is a whole lot more comfortable. The most important thing is that they kept their food at the same quality! The broths are delicious. I really hate the tongue scathing salty broths all those other mediocre ramen places serve. Also, my waitress was very attentive and sweet. We had a big group and sat there for two hours. Our water was never less than halfway full. Love this place!
Radford T.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}602}451}157}-1}4}11/25/2013}Serving delicious food via quick service, I've been to Rai Rai Ken numerous times. They have a relatively simple menu, with shoyu ramen and shio ramen being their mainstays - respectively, soy sause-based broth and seafood-based broth. That's what I usually order, and if I'm especially hungry, I'll order the chashu appetizer as well. The chashu is named after the BBQ pork dish of Cantonese origin, and although the dish served here is also pork, it tastes nothing like it. I do, however, love it nearly as much as the original Cantonese BBQ pork dish.My wife, on the other hand, is absolutely addicted to their mapo don dish. It's a spicy tofu and ground pork dish inspired by the mapo tofu dish of Sichuan origin. They have a frequent customer card - 10 ramen orders and you get one free ramn.
David N.}Manhattan, NY}184}380}147}18}3}11/12/2013}Tried the special wonton ramen and it hit the spot. The only comment is that I had the wrong expectation of the wontons. I was thinking Chinese style, but they were mostly just skins. The broth was great and the noodles had a nice bite to them.
Andy T.}Piscataway Township, NJ}283}10}0}-1}3}11/10/2013}The broth was great and the sides we had in the noodles were fresh and tastey... It was a much better wait than the 2 hour wait at ippudo, but service staff could have been better and the self sign in was a bit tacky...
Ron T.}Forest Hills, NY}180}262}32}-1}4}10/28/2013}Good, back in the day this was Ron's Ramen place.............I worked nearby and I was scared of going to Flushing and Queens for my Asian Food Fix.  Thanks to my Chinese and Thai friends I'm no longer fearful. Then Momofuku opened and I wanted more from my Ramen Joint.  I still go for a quik fix and a blast of Ron nostalgia.
Zach L.}Jersey City, NJ}493}130}524}-1}3}10/23/2013}Delicious ramen noodle spot in the east village. $10 bowls are a pretty good deal for what you get. Casual setting with a soup bar and a few small tables. I might be a little stingy on the stars because I just had Ippudo a few weeks ago and thought that was the best meal I ever had! But the noodles were good, so was everything else, the only knock i had was the broth was a tad on the saltier side. But very good, no crazy wait like Ippudo, and I'd come here again!
Sung K.}Queens, NY}231}456}0}18}3}10/21/2013}pretty disappointing. So far the worst one that I've been to in terms of ramen place. It's still a decent eat if you're craving ramen in the neighborhood. But there are much better places to be. Won't come back.
Mid G.}Washington, DC}26}242}12}-1}1}10/15/2013Updatedreview}I think I will definitely pass this place going forward.  After my recent visit and massive runs after five minutes of eating the food, I will never step food in this place again.  I don't even think Maruchan noodles even gave me the runs like that....
Irene P.}Manhattan, NY}94}103}16}-1}1}9/24/2013}I almost didn't put this review up for fear of humiliation, but I feel I owe it to the greater good.Here's where we see the limits of Zagat ratings. Placing faith in the 22-point score Zagat awarded Rai Rai Ken, boyfriend and I walked into the store rather confidently expecting a decent, regular-Joe bowl of ramen. Boyfriend ordered the miso ramen, and I asked for the shoyu ramen with corn. Girl tells me there's no extra charge for the corn. We get our bowls and start eating. Ugh. There are some unorthodox ingredients floating in our ramen, and the broth is oily with no depth. My meat is overcooked and tough. As I'm gagging through the food (hey, I was hungry), waitress comes over and tells me it turns out there -is- an extra charge for the corn, and she's adding $1 to the bill. Whatever. We leave our bowls half-finished, then figure we'll burn off the bad food by walking home (about 15 blocks away). Halfway through the walk, my stomach starts whimpering, then growling, then churning. I try to ignore it, but finally, I grab boyfriend's sleeve. "Baby," I say, wiping the sweat off my forehead. "I need a bathroom. NOW." We made about three bathroom stops on that oh-so-painful walk home. Moral of the story? Steer clear of Rai Rai Ken. It's so bad, it'll literally make you sick.
Kristina P.}BEECHHURST, NY}145}126}62}-1}3}9/20/2013}Pretty decent ramen spot.Had miso ramen and it was good but I don't think they're very authentic. The food came out super fast and the bathroom is really clean (bidet nice)
Anthony T.}New York, NY}362}65}92}-1}3}9/11/2013}Was there yesterday for lunch, I ordered a lunch set with the curry ramen. The ramen soup itself is a bit disappointed.. My ramen come in a bowl that is 75% diluted curry soup, that's very plain in favor. Come with a piece of chashu, and noodle is very limited.  But the fries rice that come with the lunch special is very nice. Knowing that the same company own curry-ya, but the curry soup is a little bit disappointing. The presentation is a little bit disappointing, normally the right way is to put soup first the add the ramen so the ramen would stay on top and all the other ingredient at the end, but they put soup last so everything is sink and lost in the soup.  Overall services is great, food is okay. Maybe because it is lunch time, so the attention to details isn't as much as dinner. Only wish it would live up to it all other siblings restaurant standard.
Andrew Y.}Hoboken, NJ}0}15}3}-1}1}9/10/2013}I used to go to this place prior to their fancy remodeling (when it used to be kinda old and dirty).  It seems like the flavors and taste have gone the inverse to it's renovations... the ramen no longer taste delicious... I was so disappointed because I had such fond memories of their food and its no longer the same.
Raphael D.}Brooklyn, NY}360}421}56}-1}3}9/9/2013}"Blah blah blah Ippudo blah authentic miso broth derp derp I'm making a big deal out of a simple dish because I'm insecure about everything else in my life."- People Who Take Ramen Way Too Seriously.If you want an affordable, hearty bowl of noodles in a very savory broth then their porky shoyu will definitely get the job done. If you want a real hot mess order the mapo tofu ramen with pork. Whatever illness was ailing you before you ate it will be on its way out afterward cause that shit spicy. It never gets too packed even on a busy night and you'll probably make it outta here for under $50 on a date.
James K.}El Cerrito, CA}232}475}163}18}3}9/6/2013}I've been wanting to try Rai Rai Ken for a while because I've heard of it multiple times and walked past it a lot too. Since it's still summer, I was craving a hiyashi chuka so I ordered that. My friend ordered the cha siu, pork buns, and also scallop and shrimp fried rice. I tried everything and I thought the food was quite good. The hiyashi chuka isn't the most impressive I've had, but I enjoyed it. The pork buns were pretty standard and the flavor of the fried rice was slightly bland. My favorite was the cha siu, fatty and yummy.
Danny W.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}1}8/23/2013}The ramen isn't that great. Wonton ramen has basically nothing; just skin. Has extreme light meal inside. You can't even taste it is wonton. Feel like tasting wonton skins.
Mitsuko B.}New York, NY}62}18}4}-1}4}8/16/2013}I've been eating here pre-renovation and have it as a go-to spot. Their mabo ramen is a two-person meal for me----two amazing dishes squished into one.  Perfect for a cold east village night. I had their cold summer ramen dish this past week (Hiyashi Chuka) and was pleasantly excited.  I was hoping for a cold soba dish, and settled for this instead.  There was a perfect ratio of vegetables (more as I desire) to chicken (less and cut nice and thin) placed in a circular cone pattern ontop the noodles. It was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of their gyoza as I prefer a thicker wonton skin.
Daniel Z.}Manhattan, NY}168}294}1464}18}5}8/14/2013}The tsukemen was very good. Tsukemen is one of my favorite ramen style, however I did not find many places serve tsukemen in NYC, Rai Rai Ken is one of the few. I would recommend this place to traditional style ramen lovers (shio, miso, shoyu etc.), start here to try something new :)
Nez B.}Manhattan, NY}250}208}280}18}4}8/14/2013}Dropped in to try the ramen with pork and seafood broth ($10) and the tsuke ramen ($14)  along with plum wine($3 happy hour after 10). According japanese pallette, its pretty damn close to authentic. Delicious, Thumbs up
Wan L.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}3}8/11/2013}I'm posting this on behalf of my mom since she still doesn't know how to use the computer.My brother brought her to Rai Rai Ken for lunch to let her compare with her few other experiences. My mom got pissed because my brother said he order a seafood ramen for her and there was no seafood. There was barely anything on their ramen but bamboo shoot and egg. There wasn't a lot of noodle, either. I told her that my brother is a bad translator and I believe that it was seafood based soup and not seafood ramen. The saving grace was that the soup was good, which pulled the rating from two stars to three.There are definitely better ramen place with comparable prices out there. But if you are not up for the wait, walk, or elbow pushing, then this is a okay place to go that is right around the corner.
Kmc M.}San Francisco, CA}5}38}1}-1}2}8/8/2013Updatedreview}First time back since their expansion doubled the amount of available seating. Sad to say, my beloved miso has lost its distinction; now it's so salty it's almost inedible--the opposite of the delight it once was. Probably will not be getting back to RRK anytime soon.
KL L.}New York, NY}5}79}0}-1}3}8/7/2013}Came here the other night because my bf's been craving for ramen (due to the david chang's the mind of a chef tv show)... it was either minca or rai rai, and I wanted to go to rai rai just because there are more varieties than at minca, but it's also different style. We got the pork buns to start with.. Meh... nothing amazing (sigh). I got the rai rai ken salad, okay, that I really enjoyed on a summer day! It was mixed with jelly fish, vermicelli noodles, a few vegetables (of course carrots taken out) in their house made dressing, which tasted like peanut chili type of sauce. My bf got the summer special which was the Tsukemen, it was thick, chewy noodles with prok and seafood based dipping sauce. His dish took literally forever to come out. I received my dish while we were eating the buns. We waited probably for about half hour... we thought maybe they forgot about his dish but supposedly his noodles had to chill... anyway... I tried a little bit of his. The dipping sauce was really fishy flavor. Then after he finished the dish, the waiter came and asked him if he wanted the shio broth to put in the dipping sauce to drink as soup but he was too full... Nothing spectacular, service was okay...
Kemi K.}New York, NY}0}3}1}-1}5}8/2/2013}Nice & cozy place @downtown Manhattan! I went with my boyfriend there. The ramen was delicious! & the pork buns were amazing. It was happy hour so it was $3(!!!) for regular sake and plum wine.  Definitely going back there!
Joji S.}Manhattan, NY}47}8}4}-1}4}8/1/2013}I come back time after time to eat the mabo ramen - other items on menu are okay but the mabo is great. Curry ramen comes in second. If you want shio or shoyu there are better options.
Shanshan G.}Norwalk, CT}46}126}39}-1}4}7/24/2013}I have been going there for years. It use to be a very small place, but it's bigger now. I love their ramen, but now I am in love with their pork bun~~~~!!! The pork bun is so good. Everyone should try it~!
Jasmine C.}Brooklyn, NY}131}198}279}-1}2}7/21/2013}We ordered two Pork Bun, Shoyu Ramen, and this mini roast pork(?) with rice. The rice was very salty. The ramen only have one piece of pork in it, honestly thought there should be more than one piece for $10 a bowl. The bun was okay, a little expensive, $8 for two.
Hit U.}New York, NY}1}785}0}-1}1}7/13/2013}Not bad for a place that doesn't have MSG, but could be better. Had the vegetarian ramen and it's something I can make at home. They do have happy hour specials which are nice.
Sharon T.}Queens, NY}820}1030}1726}18}1}6/30/2013}The cheaper-than-average prices had me but my foot in the door broke me.Came here on a Sunday night and there were many seats available.  The only 2 waitresses were too busy roaming around other tables to care we exist. The table we sat at was still wet and dirty and we had to ask twice to get it cleaned. We were not immediately served water like the people that came after us were, even after one of the waitresses took our orders and asked us what we'd like to drink, she just stood on the side the whole time afterwards.The prices were cheaper but were definitely not half of what Ippudo charges--they were around the $10 price range. I got the Miso ramen for a change and my friend got the Shoyu ramen. I know the appearance of miso ramen varies but mine looked like a hot mess--as in it looked like a messy, spicy curry noodle soup; I was very reluctant to eat it. I was puzzled with the taste because I couldn't really make much out of it. It had no salty taste and it felt like I was mostly just drinking MSG broth because there were hardly any noodles under that mountain of scallions and chicken. Noodle tasted like packaged ramen. It was a little spicy and although I'm usually very sensitive to anything hot, it wasn't as serious.The Shoyu, at least, was much more presentable with a seaweed and kamaboko but it wasn't as tasty and didn't taste so fresh. Waitresses never came up to check on us or refilled our waters. Super disappointing. If you want a mean bowl of ramen, head down to Zen 6, although I can't say Ippudo is much better since I've never had it.
Nora M.}Merritt Island, FL}28}28}13}-1}4}6/25/2013}We're stumbled upon this place after reading a local food magazine and thought we'd give it a go.   Had the curry and dry hot soup noodle dip (can't remember the name)  but both were very satisfying.  Plum wine to add which was 3 dollars in part of the happy hour late after 10pm was yummy.   We'll be back when in town.
Karl K.}San Francisco, CA}0}240}16}-1}3}6/23/2013}They weren't bad, but I've definitely had better. With so many good places in the East VIllage, I don't think I'd come back here again, especially given that there's a wait.
Waz W.}Portland, OR}19}246}320}-1}3}6/17/2013Updatedreview}We were wandering through East Village in search for late night ramen. Kambi, unfortunately, closes at 11pm. Rai Rai Ken is open until 2am on weekends!The Vegetable Miso Ramen ($10.50) was large enough to share. Soy bean based veggie broth, fairly light on the miso flavor, very heavy on the garlic. Thick curly noodles and lots of veggies. Broccoli seems a bit out of place, but I do love broccoli and garlic. The fried bean curd was a little soggy, but tasted good with the broth. Not a bad attempt at veggie ramen. I was worried that it would be all salt and no flavor, but that wasn't the case.
Karin R.}Brooklyn, NY}186}202}53}-1}4}6/14/2013}I can't say enough good things. The miso ramen is my fav. My bff comes to visit from LA a few times a year and this place is a must for her all the time. I like the happy hour there as well...I had sake, she had beer, another friend had wine...really great prices and consistently yummy ramen...I want some now actually!
Janice C.}Parkwoods - Donalda, Canada}0}1}0}-1}1}5/29/2013}Highly disappointed with my first experience at Rai Rai Ken. Customer service was lacking, no enthusiasm and not attentive to our order. Atmosphere was not authentic Japanese (ie. music). Food was the most disappointing - the Shio ramen soup was tasteless, there was only one piece of meat and no "bounce" in the noodles. Will not be visiting again.
Van M.}Manhattan, NY}2}13}0}-1}4}5/28/2013}Whenever I crave a savory bowl of ramen, I come here.  I ordered the Miso Ramen, it was delicious! The noodles were cooked to perfection and I especially love the broth here...very savory, flavorful, and tasted like it had a plethora of different flavors in one spoonful...yummm.The service is good and I love how there are different sauces at every table (vinegar, soy, sesame oil, and red chili pepper).I highly recommend it.
Ajay B.}South Windsor, CT}26}65}3}-1}3}5/27/2013}Nice cozy little spit in east village... Got the curry ramen on a cold rainy day and def hit the spot.  Considering this was the fifth spot we stopped to eat within 3 hours, n STILL finished the meal, that says something about the food (n how much I eat too I guess)!  Service was a little sketchy... Waiter seemed to not really care so much, wasn't so friendly... there was stuff floating in my water, brought the wrong dish out initially, etc...  food made up for it though for an overall good experience.
Anthony M.}Boston, MA}82}22}0}-1}3}5/22/2013}So this place is a bit hard to review as the quality is okay but the price is amazing.  First, it isn't Italian... not sure why yelp states that.  Regarding the food, the ramen is average (No comparison to Ippudo/Totto).  Nothing impressive, a bit salty and not a wide arrange of options.  We tried the curry, miso and shuyo and all were just okay.  The miso was my favourite of the three.  What makes up for the quality is the cheap prices! We went after 10pm on a Saturday and it was happy hour so plum wine and sake was $3 a glass.  The plum wine and house sake were fairly tasty too.  The service was good.  Sat at the bar, we weren't bothered and the waiters were on top of things when necessary.  I would come here again if I'm craving cheap ramen and sake.  Overall it was okay.  Cash only!
Bin H.}Los Angeles, CA}165}521}0}-1}3}5/15/2013}Tasty Shoyu Ramen, reasonable price & generous portions! The broth was a bit too salty for my palette, but the ramen itself was good.TIP: BRING CASH!
Tea A.}Brooklyn, NY}0}63}4}-1}4}5/14/2013}Pretty alright ramen, not the best but for the portion it was worth it. I ordered the mapo ramen and was made within a few minutes and they have a good staff and great host. The ramen had tofu and ground pork, I mean I could make that myself if I got off the couch and made mediocre ramen. Lastly they got one of them fancy toilets that shoots water up your be hind.
Herbert G.}Queens, NY}14}69}53}-1}3}5/13/2013}It's a ok ramen place, was not really blown away with the flavor in the ramen nothing extraordinary. I have had better ramen in other places so won't miss anything if I dont come here on a regular basis? Its more of a 3.5 place, Actually I rather go to kambi which is a few blocks away unless it's on fire or closed? lol
Joshua T.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}7}2}0}-1}4}5/6/2013}Food is good, price is decent, service is good too. Went with some friends and we all enjoyed ourselves.Also: they gave us free food during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy!
Christina L.}Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA}1}15}2}-1}5}4/24/2013}Adore this place!  My friend turned me on to it a few months ago and I travel to NY frequently. Definitely one of my stops when I'm visiting. It gets really busy and sometimes there's a wait, because its small. Nothing too bad though.Reasonable prices and consistently good.
Mimee S.}Brooklyn, NY}52}180}349}18}3}4/21/2013}Good place to eat after a night of drinking. The miso ramen is what i usually get and its delicious. Nice flavour and the broth is very tasty. My friends ordered the Shoyu ramen. It was a little bland to me even though my friend still added spicy garlic sauce in it. The lobster ramen had a very strong seafood smell and it was small. My friend was not full and had to order extra noodles.
Terita S.}Briarwood, NY}53}109}81}-1}2}4/17/2013}Quick service, noodles were good but the broths seemed plain despite the fact that they should be the primary source of flavor. Got two ramen for take out.

Danny N.}West Covina, CA}2279}1457}55400}18}5}4/4/2013}must get their pork buns! they are to die for!
Elly W.}Queens, NY}45}200}45}-1}4}3/30/2013}Great price for the amount of ramen given, cheaper than most ramen stores.Got the shoyu ramen and was not impress, was expecting more out of the broth but it just tasted okay. The noodle itself was good. Also got the seafood gyoza and that was good too. The pork given with ramen lacked flavor.I've gone to toto ramen and this and so far ToTo ramen gets the win.
Ityng H.}New York, NY}17}210}0}-1}3}3/29/2013}Colleagues and I went there during the Japan Restaurant Week.  They have a great deal happy hour on gyoza and Sapporo (I want to say it's $6?).  The prices are decent and the food's not bad.  We tried the fried rice and a ramen special.  The fried rice was not oily (a definite plus) and flavored just enough that if you needed to add condiments, the option was available.  The ramen I got was too milky/gooey for my taste.  I should've stuck with the Shoyu broth... though the curry broth was also delicious.
Marcia W.}New York, NY}65}224}8}-1}3}3/27/2013}A typical ramen shop, but for some reason (maybe the MSG) I've had better. They're quick, friendly, and the stamp card is definitely a plus. I'll always frequent it when I don't want to go too far for an inexpensive bowl of ramen.
Nishan K.}New York, NY}256}198}6}-1}5}3/27/2013}There's only two words that you need to know when you go to Rai Rai Ken. Curry Ramen.The flavor is shockingly good.  As most people who love ramen know, it can be a filling meal. Despite this, I licked my bowl clean. Everyone has their favorite ramen place in NYC and so far, Rai Rai Ken in mine.  Full disclosure - I've yet to try the highly acclaimed Ippudo, Momofuku Noodle Bar, and Totto Ramen, but I have a strong suspicion that Rai Rai Ken's curry ramen will remain one of the, if not the best, ramen dishes in the Big Apple.  If you're in the East Village, skip Minca and head to Rai Rai Ken and say those two magic words.  Curry Ramen.  You won't regret it.
C T.}Neihu District, Taiwan}5}42}1183}-1}4}3/20/2013}As usual I love their ramen here. I have tried the seasonal special, lobster soup ramen which was pretty nice. While the texture of the shrimps was a little too soft to my taste, the lobster broth of the noodle was definitely packed with flavor. Unfortunately, the waitress forgot my water till the time for the bill. The chopstick and napkin was not there till I asked for it when she brought me the noodle.Anyway, the food quality here is still as good as I remember, but tonight's service left some room to improve.
Alex G.}New York, NY}19}65}66}-1}4}3/5/2013}The quality can't be beat and the price, along with the service, is great! If it's your first time at Rai Rai Ken, I recommend the shoyu ramen. Perfect on a winter day. :) Enjoy!
Lesley M.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}2}4}0}-1}4}3/3/2013}I am a little sad to have lost the intimacy and true, Tiny Tokyo Ramen-ya feel that the old Rai Rai Ken had. And somehow, even with the expanded shop a few doors down from the original, we still had to wait for a seat. Nonetheless, I am still a fan. Noodles; chewy; miso broth; buttery -- if it's not buttery enough for you, then you can always order extra butter ... and don't forget to order extra corn!
Leah L.}Manhattan, NY}127}182}17}-1}4}2/27/2013}Great go-to ramen joint in the east village. Seating was tricky at the old location, but the new location (just a few doors down) has a lot more room. The miso ramen is the most flavorful for me. The other broths are on the lighter side. Also the pork fried rice and menma (bambo-type salad) are musts. They have a great rewards card too, after 10 ramens 11th is free!
Rose B.}Brooklyn, NY}14}5}0}-1}4}2/18/2013}This is my favorite Ramen in NYC. One because it's very tasty, but also because they offer a REAL VEGETARIAN ramen. I wish they had more veggie stuff, but for now I'm thankful for the great soup! The new location doesn't have as much ambiance as the old spot, but it's bigger, which means less waiting time to get a seat.
Josephine L.}New York, NY}21}191}3}-1}2}2/11/2013}I find Rai rai ken to be overhyped and nothing special. Their ramen is okay but because of all the hype I heard about it, I expected a lot. I've been here at least 3 times trying to love it each time but I just feel there are better ramen's out there. The noodles have great texture but I find their soups lack the rich, homestyle flavor that I crave when I want ramen. For the best ramen check out:- Santouka's spicy miso ramen - Ippudo's modern ramen- Minca's Shoyu ramenThose beat out any ramen i've tried at rai rai by a looooong shot.
Cherie L.}New York, NY}73}143}56}-1}4}2/10/2013}the pork buns here are the perfect comfort food... love that they give you the spicy sauce on the side...i prefer the ramen from other joints, it's just ok here...
James L.}Manhattan, NY}7}135}15}-1}3}2/10/2013}Interesting ramen.  Very tasty pork buns.  Cash only.  I don't care if I ever go back.
Eric R.}Westbury, NY}419}253}7}-1}1}2/5/2013}Came to Rai Rai Ken after attempting to go to Momofuku Noodle Bar on a friday night in the middle of winter. Ippudo also had a long wait time so our poor stomachs became a casualty of the ramen wars. This place looks nice and funky inside. For all intents I thought the food would be pretty good based off looks alone. Big mistake. This place is "turrble" (c) Charles Barkley. We sat down and waited and waited and waited. This place is not that big. It wasn't even that busy either. They have a collection of sauces and seasonings on the table which looked nice. Again this place is well presented but everything else was bad. After waiting for what seemed like 15-20 min a waiter came and took out drink and appetizer orders. We ordered pork buns for appetizers. They were ok. My girlfriend and I have been in a debate about who has the best bao style buns in NY and this place aint making the list. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen with extra chicken. My GF ordered the Shoyu Ramen with pork and seafood wontons. Well what came out could be ramen I guess. There was broth and noodles involved but it tasted like instant noodles. Yes the same instant noodles every college student has in their dorm. Fitting as NYU is right down the street. I would like to think we got a bad batch or something. This soy sauce based broth was just salt and water. The pork pieces were about as tender as a sweatshirt. Half the wonton's in my GF's bowl was just pieces of wonton with nothing inside. Also she had 3x the noodles in her bowl then I did.  The whole experience was just bleh. After we were done we waited again for the check to be brought. We left very unsatisfied and thought maybe we should of just waited on line at Momo, or Ippudo or drove to BK and went to Chuko.
Andrew D.}Brooklyn, NY}780}582}227}18}4}2/2/2013}The ramen here is pretty decent. I had the pork tonkotsu ramen nd my friend had the Chinese dumpling ramen. The Chinese dumpling in the ramen is kind of pathetic. If you're looking for a quick ramen shop this is pretty good. However, they were a little bit rude after we finished our meal. I know you have to turn tables when the price point is so low and number of seats is small, but there's a more classy way to say it. then tell us there's a line of people waiting to get in.
Seiji N.}San Francisco, CA}121}250}26}-1}1}1/30/2013}probably the most disappointing meal I've had in new york. We came here because we wanted something warm/brothy and the hot pot place next door had a wait of 1 1/2 hours.We were seated in the 4 seats at the bar near the door and people were standing behind us the whole time we ate. They really needed to wait outside since there was plenty of space. It's just not very comfortable eating with people breathing down your neck.The above point isn't really the restaurant's fault, but I guess they could put a sign or something to wait outside.Other things that occurred that made this meal the worst are as follows:1. Ordered the buns and was halfway finished with mine when the server came with my ramen. He had issues putting the ramen down and full-on put his arm on my bun that I was eating... umm yeah I'd rather not have any of your dead skin and arm hair on my pork bun. He didn't say anything and just walked away. wtf...2. My friend ordered the mapo tofu dish, not the ramen. They brought out the ramen and they quickly fixed the order.... so quick that I think they just took some of the broth from the ramen and just put it on a plate with rice. The mapo tofu was super runny and didn't look that great.3. The broth was so watered down. I really wanted a full-flavored broth, but sadly my shoyu ramen broth was like they mixed a bowl full of water they boiled the ramen noodles in, and poured a little bit of soy sauce. It wasn't very satisfying at all and probably one of the worst ramen broth i've had.Def not recommend to anyone.
Marissa P.}New York, NY}140}500}17}18}2}1/28/2013}After eating at Ippudo I knew I had to have ramen again.  Tried this place -- serious let down compared to Ippudo.  Maybe I shouldn't compare the two, but alas....I had basically the same thing.  The ramen noodles weren't half as good, the broth flavorless/not rich at all, the pork was full of fat and not tender (at Ippudo it was falling apart, lean, succulent).  I wouldn't go back.  Prices are the same.
Anne W.}Brooklyn, NY}155}189}150}18}3}1/15/2013}Ramen was eh. Bidet was fantastic.
Jonathan B.}Mohegan Lake, NY}110}136}93}-1}4}1/14/2013}I understand why they expanded and renovated by I prefer the old spot.  The service is only so-so but it's worth going for the food.  The yakisoba is flat out delicious. I like their ramen and recently had a ramen special that was great, but their standard miso ramen is very good and it's just great comfort food.  I think their ramen is better than Momofuku's, which I found to be bland and a bit oily/greasy from the pork belly.
Karl P.}New York, NY}214}9}0}-1}3}1/8/2013}I liked their old space better, but I guess with success comes the ability to move in to bigger and better digs. The food is still the same though. Strong ramen and typically not a long wait to get a seat. As a previous reviewer mentioned, it's a good alternative when the wait at Momofuku is over an hour. I actually really enjoy the curry ramen here more than other noodle places I've been to. And the prices are right too.
Helen L.}New York, NY}143}67}13}-1}3}12/29/2012}mediocre ramen. lots of choices though! small place and only 1 waitress so service was slow. nevertheless, nice clean place with cheap ramen.
Josh M.}Brooklyn, NY}337}399}46}18}3}12/17/2012Updatedreview}This place has slid pretty far down on my list from a 5 to a 3.  They moved next door and took over a larger space. Gone are the small quaint feel, the jockeying for seats, the feeling like you found a gem.  The prices have increased too...not my go-to anymore.
Alan C.}FRESH MEADOWS, NY}1}5}0}-1}4}12/12/2012}Rai Rai Ken is my favorite ramen house in all of NY. I miss the tiny hole in the wall but I appreciate the extra seating that the new area brings.The service isn't phenomenal. I've once had a friend been spoken down to because he wasn't sure how authentic their miso buttercorn ramen was. The place is usually packed as well. The food is amazing. The char siu appetizer is worth the extra cash. The ramen is no joke either. You also have the option of picking what types of noodles you want. The soup base is delicious but not as heavy as kambi or minca. On a side note, I've always wanted to try their almond tofu dessert but they never seem to have it in stock...
Susan B.}Woodhaven, NY}144}61}266}-1}3}12/2/2012}For the price, this was a fairly decent bowl of ramen. It wasn't out of this world, but it wasn't crap either. The noodles were springy and the pork; tasty. The broth could have been a bit saltier and meatier. The spinach was a very nice touch. If I was in the neighborhood and in the mood for some cheap ramen, I'd visit again.
Amanda W.}New York, NY}177}14}6}-1}3}11/24/2012}I've walked by this place several times and it always seems to be pretty full so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try the other night. We got seated right away at a table by the window. I ordered pork buns to share and miso ramen and remembered as I took the first few sips that I saw something about specifying the saltiness of the broth when you order. But the waitress didn't remind us or ask us about it and since I am not used to saltiness-to-order I forgot. The broth was so bland I just about poured half of the container of soy sauce into my ramen to make it palatable. The shredded chicken in the broth was incredibly dry and tasteless. The pork buns were the only saving grace of the entire meal which was overwhelmed anyways by the mediocre ramen. Overall I probably wouldn't go here again given the plethora of other ramen choices in east village. However the prices are very reasonable so perhaps someday, just not anytime soon.  Cash only.
Jia Y.}Brooklyn, NY}17}53}15}-1}4}11/24/2012}Love the chewy and texture of their ramen. It's a little pricy for my standard but   Its NYC
Florian L.}Cambridge, MA}0}9}0}-1}4}11/20/2012}Really good ramen noodles for a fair price (10 to 14$).Fast & helpful service.The waiting list was a bit too chaotic and seats were small.
H. W.}Brooklyn, NY}0}124}0}-1}3}11/11/2012}It's no longer a tiny hole-in-the-wall. There are shiny lights on the sign outside and it's bigger and actually seems like a restaurant now. The interiour is brightly lit with a wrap around ramen bar on the left side coming in, and tables along the right hand side and in the back. I didn't have a wait and food arrived quickly. Had the curry ramen, which was a good size with generous included toppings. Curry didn't taste like the usual japanese curry though. Hard to describe, it was heartier and tangier, with more of a meaty stew tasting base. Good, but not what I was expecting.  Menu and prices seemed to have stayed the same with a few new items specially marked as new. Service was hurried but efficient. There were several cooks behind the counter but only one slightly stressed waiter to deal with all customers. But it seemed like a comfortable, fast-casual spot and I would probably go more often if I lived in the area.
Kim K.}New Haven, CT}19}31}0}-1}2}11/9/2012}I've been spoiled by the plethora of NYC ramen places. The bowls are cheaper priced, but you get what you pay for. The noodles lack the chewy bite that I love, and the broth didn't have the smooth heartiness that comes with overnight stewing typical of staple ramen places.
Monika L.}Washington, DC}66}114}5}-1}4}10/30/2012}Service was kinda bad here (it took a long time for them to bring us our food, and, since we were in the back, it was hard to get their attention for water, etc)But the Ramen was delicious, had a good choice of appetizers, and it came out to ~$15 a person.  Sweeeeeeeeet.  I can see myself coming back here if Momofuku was crowded again.
Wendy G.}Minato, Japan}238}721}1145}18}2}10/24/2012}Their ramen is about as good as the noodle you cook at home. Noodles are not really ramen - they are thin cheap noodles; the soup base is pure salt.I gave two star, 1 for the comfortable seating and ok service,  the other for the decent price while asking for extra spinach/meat toppings.Food themselves are too mediocre to even think about, unfortunately.
Diana L.}Brooklyn, NY}11}50}4}-1}5}10/23/2012}My two favorite dishes on the menu are the curry ramen and a seasonal cold summer dish. The ramen is a great price and the portion is perfect.  I have been to other ramen places in park slope that are 5 dollars more with less noodles.I LOVE the fact that you can add all kinds of extras like spinach, roasted garlic and many other delicious things for a small price.The kimchee here is really good compared to others.The pork buns are so good. They are made fresh to order and come out with a mound of pork inside of a small sandwich  type bun.  Order these now!Another plus is the super clean bathroom with a heated toilet seat!
Liz M.}Manhattan, NY}4}18}8}-1}2}10/22/2012}The ambience was great however we ordered the pork buns which were mediocre, it was literally a piece of Chinese roast pork, hoasin sauce and a little veggie inside. The better part is that it came with spicy sauce since it was so plain. I've had better ones at other places. On to the ramen, I ordered the Shiyo thinking it was ramen + wontons. It wasn't that great, there was virtually no meat in the wonton and there was a tiny piece of shrimp. The noodle was not ramen at all even though the description was 'ramen' it tasted like regular Chinese noodles Very disappointing.
Leslie J.}Brooklyn, NY}10}16}0}-1}5}10/22/2012}My favorite, inexpensive ramen in the city. Also, the new veggie broth is excellent.  Super sweet waitstaff as well. Love the new space.  Yeah Rai Rai Ken!
Maria Z.}Brooklyn, NY}0}8}0}-1}5}10/22/2012}Our favorite Ramen spot. They recently expanded and were able to keep the same great flavors.  I get craving for it, that's how good it is. I usually get the Miso Ramen, we split the pork buns and Menma (bamboo shoots).
Paul B.}New York, NY}1}31}18}-1}3}10/19/2012}Why fix what's not broken.. gotta say that I'm real disappointed that they joined the ranks of all the other 'gentrified' ramen places in the city. Well almost all, Menkui tei remains true to its old school Japan feel. Rai Rai's miso chicken ramen is still killer w/ the garlic chips as are their seared gyoza but, I sure do miss their original tight gritty spot next door where the ramen was center stage and the room was cozy.
Hong L.}Brooklyn, NY}304}612}191}18}2}10/18/2012}Rai Rai Ken moved to a new spot next door - it's much bigger and more modern...I am a little sad though. Rai Rai Ken lost that small traditional Japanese ramen joint flare, which I thought was what made Rai Rai Ken ....Rai Rai Ken.The restaurant feels more like a fast food spot to grab a quick bit of ramen. The only thing is that the ramen doesn't come out that quickly. My ramen came 5 minutes later than the rest of my friends' dishes. There are some things that were good just as they used to be.
Lisa F.}Fresh Meadows, NY}162}271}243}-1}3}10/17/2012}Hubs and I took a detour to RRK after being dejected by the 2 hr long wait for another popular ramen joint nearby.The sight of the brightly lit and modern ramen spot was actually like a welcoming beacon on a chilly autumn night and so we were pretty happy that the wait was only 10 minutes.As many have mentioned, this is the new location that is 2 doors down from the their previous shop. The aesthetic is completely different and doesn't look like a traditional ramen cavern but has large glass windows in the front and an Asian modern theme on the inside.Onto the food. We arrived in time for HH special which was 1 free draft with a gyoza order so we got that as well as the Shoyu Ramen and Shio Wonton Ramen.Gyoza was pretty standard. Crispy on the outside with a minced pork, scallion filling that I found to be a little on the mushy side.My shoyu broth was decent but a little on the thin and plain side. There are no slow simmered bones in this broth. This comes with wavy noodles which were served al dente and then they slowly soften as you eat on. The portion of shoots and scallions was pretty generous which i really enjoy. It really baffles me why some places are so stingy with these 2 ingredients when its so cheap. There was one slice of roast pork which had a good ratio of lean meat to fat. You could also taste the salt seasoning which I prefer to some places where the meat doesn't have any saltiness. I do like the soft boiled egg that they include. Its slowly cooked so that the yolk stays orange but it could have used more marinating/seasoning.The hubby wasn't a fan of his Shio bowl and felt the wontons were weak AND was disappointed that it didn't come with a piece of pork. We ended up trading midway through. The Shio bowl reminded me more of a Chinese style noodle soup with the thin egg noodles and seafood flavored broth. Overall, it was pretty satisfying since I was just looking for a bowl of warm comfort but it doesn't hit the R(amen) spot if that's what you are craving.
Ben F.}East Meadow, NY}593}226}22}-1}4}10/12/2012}I really liked their Miso Ramen, not as much as other places but its different here.Chicken stockPulled breastAl dente veggy and noodlesfried pieces of garlic on top...............SAY WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA­AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA­AAAAAAAAAT.  I'd definitely try them again.  Chef is friendly made the time spent their better, they also have happy hour deals on apps and draft beers.  Check them out.
Michelle W.}New York, NY}520}1128}48}18}5}10/10/2012Updatedreview}Finally got a chance to experience the new restaurant and it's just as good as it was the last time. I still miss the hole in the wall look and feel, but they've definitely upgraded and with more seats, there's a much shorter wait. However, since the place is much more welcoming, people are going to linger so the wait might not be that much shorter after all. More importantly, the ramen is delicious. They have new dishes with wontons, but i stuck with the Shio Ramen and loved every last bite of it. Still one of my top ramen places.
Jin C.}New York, NY}33}997}148}18}2}10/7/2012}I had ramen here a little over a week ago and I can't even remember what it tastes like. I did remember not finishing my food, and considering that I usually slurp down my ramen really easily, this is a really bad sign. I tried Rai Rai Ken's pork buns - they were okay, if not a little bit expensive. The shoyu noodles just tasted kind of strange, and I wasn't fond of the factory-made noodles. There are so many ramen options in the East Village that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by coming here.
Linh N.}Brooklyn, NY}169}540}1462}-1}1}10/6/2012Updatedreview}After Rai Rai Ken had moved over 2 storefronts, everything changed.The space is a lot bigger, they have individual tables with seats for 2 which can be put together for a bigger party. My boyfriend and I had a bit of a wait but was called in within 10 minutes or so. The menu seems to be the same as it used to with special ramen on a small different menu. They had some new items on the menu like salad, pork buns, and wontons.Rai Rai Ken Salad - Not a bad salad at all. Consisted of jelly fish, vermicelli, shredded chicken, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro and carrot in a sesame dressing. Really refreshing and gives you the sense of a true Asian salad.Pork Buns - Definitely experienced better. The buns were really pillow-y soft but the pork were really small and the entire bun was smothered in hoisin sauce, it really overpowered the whole bun.Shoyu Wonton Ramen - Because it was a new item on the menu, I must try it. Upon getting the bowl, I was surprised and disappointed at the same time. The bowl was huge, seems to hold a lot more ramen than it once did but all the ingredients in the bowl was lacking in every way. The wontons were tiny, the filling were the size of my pinky nail and it was bland. The soy based broth tasted flavorless also like it had been watered down. The bamboo shoots that I once loved had lost its consistency and was once again bland. The ramen noodles was the biggest disappointment, the strands were extremely overcooked and didn't have that al-dente ramen bite to it. The only best part was probably the egg...Shio Ramen w/ butter and corn - My boyfriend loves his butter and corn and sadly to say that when his bowl arrived to his table, the butter was extremely small but there was a lot of corn. The seafood broth was a bit more flavorful than mine. The noodles were still overcooked.I feel so heartbroken because the Rai Rai Ken I once remembered and loved had changed drastically. They give you quantity but take away from the quality. As we were waiting for a table in front of the store, we overheard a passerby say "this place taste pretty awesome when you're totally wasted." And you know, I actually agree with him 100% after eating here. Sorry Rai Rai Ken, you've lost me...
DJ K.}Newark, NJ}1}41}4}-1}4}10/2/2012}Went on a Saturday night around 8PM, waited roughly 10 mins to be seated. We had the 'Vegetable Miso Ramen' which for the most part was good. I personally would have like a little more salt to taste, but the vegetables and bean curd was good. We had 1 bowl for two people, was just enough for the both of us. Also had the saki and beer here, at reasonable prices. I would go back if i was in the area.Total bill with tip was less than $32 for 2 people.
Colin Z.}New York, NY}4}6}1}-1}2}9/27/2012}Rai Rai Ken lost its charm when it moved to its new and current location. I understand growth and expansion but unfortunately with the move, they lost the old cozy, ramen house appeal. Now its just a bland and modern dime a dozen ramen joint.  I'm not even sure if it is authentic Japanese since there weren't any Japanese cooks or staff members. But I'm not sure what that means.For the food: I'm all for individual interpretation of original dishes but wow, their Miso Ramen was strange.. It was more like curry than anything. But i must say the noodles were cooked properly and the fried onions added a nice touch. Overall, the salty orange glowing soup base was too much of a negative factor to overcome the subtle touches.  Above average pricing for unremarkable ramen make this place a miss.
Barrett L.}Washington, DC}709}286}0}-1}4}9/24/2012}BF and I came to Rai Rai Ken on a late friday night (right after being told that we would have to wait an hour and a half for two at Ippudo.  at 10:45 at night).  Thankfully, there was no wait and we were able to get seated at the counter immediately.  This popular East Village ramen joint (one of many) now occupies a new spacious storefront along 10th St, two doors down from their original 12 seat operation.  The spacious interior, good service, and tasty food definitely makes it a power player in the New York ramen scene.  Not the best, but a solid contender.We started with the steamed pork buns, among some of the best I've ever had.  A perfectly cooked juicy and melty slab of pork belly sandwiched on a steamed bun with vegetables and savory sauce.  The hot chili oil served alongside it definitely helped to accentuate the flavors of the pork bun instead of mask them in a layer of heat.  As for the ramen, it's very good.  The noodles are fresh and tender, the broth savory, and the vegetables and egg cooked perfectly.  The pork, on the other hand, is much more tough compared to neighboring joints.  Whereas the pork at Minca is soft, tender, and melts in your mouth, Rai Rai Ken's pork has more toughness to it.  It's good, but not a good carrier of flavor.The new space definitely helps, with its high ceilings and more than double the capacity of the old storefront.  It can also support the crowds that keep coming in.  Furthermore, the service is good and the prices are fair.  Overall, it's not my favorite ramen joint in the city, but it makes a good product at a good price.  Definitely worth your while if you can't make it to Minca or get shut out of Ippudo.
Kevin W.}Manhattan, NY}45}548}18}-1}3}9/20/2012}Proof positive I ve become a true food snob. Back in the day this used to be a go to spot for ramen, now it's barely passable for me. Got the shio ramen. Seafood based broth? Meh. Wheres the boiling pork bones and resulting tonkatsu broth? Not here. Granted the ramen is def cheaper here - 9 50 a bowl vs 13 50 atthe other places. But I'd rather pay more. Their pork slices on top also need to be fattier cuts - not that flavorful in my opinion. They've moved into a larger space a couple doors down - I hope they do well out of nostalgia. Maybe their mapo tofu and miso Ramens r better.
Jane S.}Manhattan, NY}1}46}1}-1}1}9/10/2012}I used to love this place, but they really dumbed down the food and menu, after the renovation, made it trendy, and packing them in. Before they had fabulous seafood broth. Now it is tasteless. Noodles are mushy.  No ramen place should  serve mushy noodles! What?  Are they trying to be David Chang' s Momofuku? They served wontons in their seafood broth.   Never did before! Ok, so if you serve wontons, which are Chinese, in a Japanese place,  then serve damn GOOD ones  ------   not a bunch of wonton skins stuck together with barely a pinky nail smear of a paste,  which is billed as shrimp and pork, but looked like cat food. Fortunately didn't taste like cat food, but it didn't taste like anything -------  because there was so damn little of it that all you tasted was the wonton skins STUCK together. Any Chinese takeout place has better wontons, and at a far lower price point. In fact the meat in ONE takeout wonton could be used to "fill" 10 full orders of RRK 's wontons. I kid you not. That is how little filling there was in RRK 's wontons.If you know nothing about ramen go here . Otherwise stay away.Shoyu broth is salty. Roast pork is tasteless and tiny. Fishcake is a shaving of fishcake slightly bigger than the size of a quarter.Um,  pork belly buns? Wontons? Really? Is Rai Rai pan Asian now? Really bad Asian fusion. Go to Chinatown for real pork belly and wontons, for 1/4 the price and no waiting! RRK is not going to break the bank but I really felt ripped off for inferior food. Oh I almost forgot,  they now charge for tea. What used to be an authentic slice of Japan with its tight counter, authentic food, with real Japanese ramen chefs, where you felt as if you stumbled into a Tokyo ramen hole in the wall has turned into a trendy place with blaring music and inedible food largely prepared by Mexican help.Now id thid worth lining up for! Yes, there IS a wait here. On plus side, staff is nice although harried because only two waitresses.    No Japanese people eat here now!   So sad. I used to love this place!!!! Stay away!!!!
Celia Y.}Astoria, Queens, NY}649}335}530}-1}4}9/8/2012}I've been on a mission to find a place that serves tsukemen so I've been eyeing this place for a while! Apparently they only have tsukemen for the summer. For the price of $14 I got a big bowl of fresh noodles, a dish of pickled items, and a broth to dip the noodles in. I was quite surprised and impressed at the quality of the noodles.. cold,chewy, flavorful, and fresh! But unfortunately, the tsukemen broth (that pretty much makes a whole tsukemen meal memorable) was quite bland. I did end up adding a few sauces to adjust the flavor but the broth was just too watery. There was not enough spices, flavors, or texture. The meal was definitely light and refreshing, but for tsukemen I would have liked something with more flavor. I would definitely like to come back and try their other dishes because they really do serve some delicious noodles here!
Eri S.}Berkeley, CA}298}154}21}-1}3}9/4/2012}So I was walking down 10th and almost had a heart attack when I saw their old location. IT'S CLOSED AND I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO TRY IT?!?!?! ...oh, they moved a few doors down. phew.I ordered their Shio (salt) Ramen ($8.50), which came with bbq pork, naruto, bamboo shoots, half an egg, and seaweed. I found the soup to be kind of bland....err...light. But I appreciated the amount of toppings that came with the ramen. It was unmemorable but for the price and for the sake of not waiting 1+ hours for pricey ramen (ahem ippudo/momofuku), it's worth a try!
Renee M.}New York, NY}126}340}18}-1}4}8/31/2012}They have grown into a new space right next door...The wait here is never terribly long if you come after 9pm (approximately 10-15min), the waitstaff is friendly and always willing to give you recommendations and explain the difference between their hot and cold ramen selections.The difference in between Ippudo and Rai Rai Ken comes down to:1. Ippudo's Hot Broth is hands down the best, ya just can't touch this2. Rai Rai Ken's Ramen Noodle is fresher, better made than Ippudo's, and their broth is not as flavorful as Ippudo, but has that authentic taste that we all seek in a hearty bowl of ramen3. The seasonal ramen selection is ALWAYS Amazing.4. Cost - Rai Rai Ken is must more cost effective
James C.}Bayside, NY}3}44}10}-1}3}8/31/2012}Ramen is OK. Gyoza and cha-han rice and other dishes are really good though. Pork buns are better than momofuku but not as good as ippudo. Good prices for beer. All in all a good cheap meal. Recommend Gyoza, cha-han rice, and beer.
Aisling C.}Astoria, NY}121}44}36}-1}4}8/23/2012}I got the curry ramen it was amazing and they have rice noodles for those who eat gluten free! def my new go to ramen locationonly thing i didn't like was CASH only :(
Patti M.}Orlando, FL}197}724}73}18}5}8/21/2012}Knowing nothing about real ramen I first starting eating here in 2009 (before they opened their new location a few doors down) based on the recommendation of a friend.  I found a no nonsense old school ramen bar with really cute, friendly, speedy cooks who serve up steaming bowls of goodness.  The new location is thankfully much larger and no less cozy.  I brought my nephew here and he too is now addicted.  The next time that plane lands at JFK I'll jump on the A and head straight over.  Afterward, I highly recommend walking down the street a few paces and hitting Kung Fu tea.
Linda S.}Flushing, NY}146}261}92}-1}3}8/21/2012}Good and cheap, but not what I was expecting!  I was expecting a Ramen Setagaya-like experience but I guess I didn't read the description on yelp very carefully. This is definitely a Chinese-influenced ramen joint, not Japanese, so the broth was less fatty and rich than I was expecting. The toppings were also more typically Chinese than the standard, so think bok-choi, mapo flavors, and something called canton-men.I did, however, like the thin noodles that they used. For what you're getting, an $8 serving of ramen is not bad, but just don't expect to get the best ramen you've ever had! Cash only.
Jess W.}Manhattan, NY}222}319}274}18}4}8/20/2012}I had a late dinner here, at their new location. The new store is much more spacious and better for larger groups.We started with the pork buns, which were mediocre. Everyone around us ordered th fried rice, which I will have to try next time. I had the shoyu ramen with wavy rather than straight noodles. They accidentally added extra noodles to my order, so it was a huge bowl of ramen. The broth was great and the hot sauce they served on the side was a perfect addition.
Lukas W.}East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA}11}77}6}-1}3}8/9/2012}Great food at reasonable prices here. I had the summer special cold noodles, which was decent. My friend had a big steaming bowl of ramen with pork (can't recall the name) that was delicious. And the pork buns were GREAT! Everything very nicely presented to us as well. Unfortunately the service was so-so. After we got our food the waiters & waitresses seemed to forget about us and water refills and the bill never came until we asked. Cash only!
Nadav S.}New York, NY}10}45}0}-1}4}8/3/2012}Had lunch there once and enjoyed good rammen for a good price.
Jessica D.}Brooklyn, NY}527}851}2165}18}3}7/22/2012}My boyfriend and I are on a quest to find the tastiest and best ramen joint. Rai Rai Ken just didn't do well for us.Service was slow. Food was good.Gyoza - 6 pieces of dumpling that were pan-fried. These were pretty good.Shio Ramen - House special seafood based noodle soup topped with bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed and scallion. The texture of the noodles was thread-like, very thin. It wasn't oversalted or overwhelmed with flavor. It's worth your bucks!Curry Ramen -  topped with roast pork, egg, scallion and seaweed. My boyfriend ordered this. The ramen had a spongy feeling to it. The soup tasted a slight bit water downed.Almond Tofu - I saw in people's reviews that the almond tofu dessert had fruit cocktails too. However, when our cups of almond tofu arrived, there were no fruit cocktails. Instead, it was some type of raisin or dried fruit. The almond tofu wasn't overwhelming and the taste of it was perfect. I was utterly disappointed that there was no fruit cocktails on top.My boyfriend and I were quite disappointed with Rai Rai Ken. The service was unbelievably slow and the food just didn't quite match up to our standards.
Christine C.}Manhattan, NY}106}184}8}-1}3}7/19/2012}I think I should have stuck with a more traditional ramen order. I had the mabo tofu ramen. It was fine, but nothing too special. I got bored of it halfway through the meal. It was the same one-note pork/tofu taste. No combination of flavors from all the different ingredients and texture in your more typical miso or pork broth ramen. Noodles were a good texture though! Not too soft, with a hint of firmness. I'll have to try this place again.
Abby S.}New York, NY}273}227}1}-1}4}7/10/2012}My once a week ramen tradition led me to Rai RAi Ken. I know it's the middle of the summer and is scorching hot outside but that doesnt matter. I still crave a nice big hot bowl of Japanese ramen. The place is really nice in a cute little tree lined street in the East Village. I arrived right when they opened at noon. Its a pretty big place, goies all the way back and if they have the countertop/bar facing the kitchen if you like to sit there near the action.I loved their menu. They have a really good selection of different ramen. they have your typical miso and shoyu and they also have shio, which not a lot of places have.. and bonus, they have curry ramen! so exciting! they also serve the usual gyoza and shumai and fried rice galore.i ordered the miso ramen with chicken and extra soft boiled eggs. My big bowl of fun was served and i could hardly contain myself. The noodles were perfectly cooked, it still had that nice consistency, as the the italians would say, al dente. The chicken was plentiful, veggies were great and the soup was tasty. They also put these pieces of dried garlic which just took my ramen experience to a whole new level!It was soooo good! Of course i saved the best for last... the soft boiled eggs. I look forward to my two last bites of my ramen bowl bc of this. Perfect perfect eggs, the yolk in the middle still that bright yellow but not runny. ahhhh nirvana.Rai rai Ken is the perfect ramen place if you dont feel like fighting your way though the high profile ramen places like ippudo and momofuku or toto ramen. And its just as good!!!
Anthony P.}Manhattan, NY}206}111}7}-1}3}7/10/2012}Probably the best deal for ramen in the city with a bowl of ramen for ~$8. That being said, this is probably an average bowl of ramen at best. I got the Shoryu Ramen when I went here and the broth is lacking in flavor and the noodles are bit too soft. Their gyoza are good but not amazing.Good:Waittime: None on a Thursday night at 6 for 2Prices: A ramen and side for around $10 is a stealNot-so-Good:Bland brothSoft noodlesThough probably no Ramen joint can beat its prices, the quality is just average and doesn't shine above the other East Village Ramen places. You won't be missing much if you are eating elsewhere. 3/5
Phoebe L.}Manhattan, NY}130}9}26}-1}5}7/7/2012}Best deal in New York. I work writing music, painting, writing poetry...I go all night long-- I get so absorbed I forget to eat --- Then about 3 in the morning I say "WOW I am hungry!"  so I go downstairs and I eat Edamame and a half portion of rice at Rai Rai.  This costs about 7 dollars. New York Artists used to survive on kasha from Veselka but that place has become too expensive. Thank God there's still Rai Rai Ken. They play good music and they are really nice to me. I notice Sarah A here at Yelp says they have gone downhill. It's true there was some slacking. but they are RIGHT BACK where they used to be thank God!
Vivian K.}New York, NY}63}77}47}-1}5}7/6/2012}One thing I love about summers is the addition of cold noodles on menus! Lots of Japanese ramen shops add a hiyashi chuka or cold ramen soup for a summer special. It's primarily a soy sauce and vinegar soup base that is fairly easy to make at home. I like to try it at restaurants for their toppings! And the refreshing taste is the perfect solution to a sticky and yuck summer day. Out of three places that I've had it (Sapporo East & Setagaya), Rai Rai Ken stood out to me the most. The ramen shop has an average amount of seating but isn't recommended for large parties. My bowl of cold ramen arrived neatly and colorfully arranged, with toppings of red ginger, shredded chicken, seaweed, vegetables, egg, dried tomato and apple slices! The apple slices surprised me (also that they forgot to mention it on their menu). I think the sweet apple went perfectly well with the salty and sour taste. The noodles had a good texture, not overcooked or soggy and had me wanting more. Price is average but reasonable for a manhattan location. Overall enjoyed my lunch thoroughly and will come back during the winter months for a hot bowl of ramen!
Sarah A.}Brooklyn, NY}8}73}0}-1}2}6/26/2012}I used to really enjoy this place, but my past couple visits have been lackluster at best. The broth has tasted really anemic, and the add-ins haven't had a lot of flavor, either. The service is always on the order of "how can we get these customers out of here faster?", and those hard, fixed seats are pretty cramped and uncomfortable.The last time I went, I was so annoyed at all these factors that I decided it wasn't worth it to return.
Kevin L.}NY, NY}20}135}143}-1}4}6/10/2012}I love a good bowl of ramen noodles and Rai Rai Ken certainly delivers. They recently moved into a new, nicely renovated space three stores down from their old location with lots of new seating. I ordered the Rai Rai Ken salad (with jellyfish, noodles, vegetables, cilantro, and a sour-ish dressing) for my appetizer, which had plenty of punch to it. I just wished thy mixed it a bit better because all the jellyfish sank to the bottom.For my main dish, I got the shoyu ramen with extra crispy garlic, which is probably one of the most loaded bowls they had. Loved the flavors coming out of it and the mix of different toppings that were in it. The ramen noodles themselves were just perfect. Not too slippery and just the right amount of chewiness to it. For dessert, the almond tofu was a bit of a miss for me. Although it was refreshing and sweet after a bowl of ramen, it just didn't do it for me.Despite that, I fallen in love with Rai Rai Ken. It's a great place for a bowl of ramen to satisfy your cravings.
Emerald S.}Manhattan, NY}28}30}2}-1}2}6/8/2012}Last night I went to Rai Rai for the first time since they've moved to their new location (a few doors down). I use to be a huge fan of this place but after tonight's experience, I doubt I will be going back. Staff was friendly enough and service was okay but the ramen was a HUGE disappointment. We both ordered our usual, the shoyu ramen. What came out of kitchen was nearly inedible. You could see literally 1-2cm of oil on top of the soup. I understand that you need some oil but 1-2 cm of oil around the entire bowl? Seriously? We bought wanted to give it a chance so we tried it. We just tasted and felt the oil in our mouths. My bf and I had to scoop out the oil in order to eat the ramen. By then the ramen was already too soft. Egg was quite delicious though and the gyoza were okay. Nothing special. All in all, this will not be a place I will return especially since there are so many other ramen places in NYC.
Ichiro M.}Newark, NJ}12}5}0}-1}4}6/7/2012}I think of myself as a ramen connoisseur -- I went to university in Sapporo (one of the ramen capitals of Japan), where, I went out and ate a lot of ramen at these hole-in-the-wall joints (I'm thankful that I was still in my 20s then, if I ate that much ramen now, I'd probably have blood pressure problems). Rai Rai Ken is probably as "typical" as it gets as the places I've frequented in Sapporo and other Japanese cities --  the hole-in-the-wall joints on a side street. In that sense, it is "authentic."I've read anther review that talked about the noodles being "too soft." The best thing about ordering ramen in Sapporo was that you could customize, like you can with your sandwich at Subway. I'd like to add that at another ramen joint in NYC, I've read an explanation in the Japanese-language menu that stated that they served their noodles on the soft side to cater to the local clientele, which would be consistent with what I've experienced at other NY area ramen places in general. So if you wanted the noodles to be more "al dente", so to speak, just tell your server that you want it so. In general, this sort of customization is not typical in Japanese cuisine and even in the culture at large, but at Rai Rai Ken, they will do it.I've read comparisons with Ippudo, which I think is like comparing Starbucks to a mom-and-pop diner. At the former, you can count on getting middle-to-upper end, solid yet standardized (i.e., corporate) product similar to ones you find at any of their other outlets (there are fifty or so Ippudo stores all over Japan). Rai Rai Ken, on the other hand, you'll get something pretty similar to what work-weary Japanese students and workers seeking a quick and inexpensive meal would on their way home.
Jeff T.}Washington, DC}345}187}34}-1}3}6/6/2012}I'm not the biggest fan of ramen. I think the kind I make at home is the best because I poach eggs like nobody's business and I can throw whatever kind of meats and veggies I want into it. The whole thing costs like $2.50.People have been telling me how great Ippudo is but I've never been one to *wait* for food. Rai Rai Ken, also in East Village, seemed to be the perfect solution. The service was friendly, and they had a table for two available immediately. On first inspection prices are about $5-6 cheaper than Ippudo. All positives.Having not been to a truly great ramen house, I guess I have nothing to measure against, but Rai Rai Ken seemed a bit lacking. The noodles weren't chewy enough for my taste and the broth could have been more flavorful / salty. The wontons in my ramen were pretty good though and the egg was actually really intense and tasty. Perhaps Ippudo gets everything right and thus, warrants the wait and price?If you'd rather not deal with all that fuss, Rai Rai Ken is a suitable substitute.
Joyce L.}Brooklyn, NY}25}241}310}-1}2}6/3/2012}Not a fan of this ramen place even though my friend loves it. I tried the Shio ramen and did not like the broth which I thought was too bland. Pork buns were just OK but nothing to rave about. The Rai Rai Ken salad was supposed to have jellyfish but they substituted that with lots of shredded chicken which we were not informed about. The chashu don is big for the price but the chashu is shredded, contains too much mayo with the rice and is served with lots of raw cabbage which i hate. My friend loves the Shio wonton ramen and she says the wonton is very good and made with fresh ingredients but they are REALLY tiny! I tried the miso based soup and it is way too oily with hints of curry in it which makes it taste weird. I only come here because my friend insists on it but if I had it my way I would just head a block down to Sapporo East instead. Sure Rai Rai Ken is cheap and it'll fill you up really quick but I'd rather spend a buck or two more for tasty and cheap ramen.
Stephanie C.}Manhattan, NY}301}289}25}-1}2}5/29/2012}I give this place a 2 because my friend loves this place but she's one of those people who don't like pork base broth or anything meaty. I on the other hand did not like their gyoza dumplings which were sad, lacked veggies & meat. The shoyu ramen I got was nothing out of the ordinary but the egg was really flavorful. Other than that I'm sticking to Ippudo. Bill came out to be cheap but $6 for dumplings is seriously overrated.The service was good though.
Kenda T.}Manhattan, NY}11}107}88}-1}2}5/27/2012}Went to the place today. I am not a fan. The place i am told is not their usual hut. That this is a new place they moved to. Well in came the design and out went the ramen. The miso pork was not the best. The broth was not very spicy as i was told it would be nor flavorful...I wanted to try a new ramen place. well i tried. I didn't even want to stay to try the gyoza. Maybe I will go for that. one day if I feel forgiving. The only interesting part of the meal, was when I splattered broth on my shirt and went to the beautifully designed bathroom to wash it out. I took off my shirt, scrubbed it with the mild soap, rinsed and twisted it, put it back on, then pushed my chest under their cool looking hand dryer with my hand underneath to activate it, all the while laughing at myself in the mirror at how ridiculous i looked. It was about the best part of the meal. and then i left....thanks....
Luca M.}Brooklyn, NY}1}14}7}-1}4}5/27/2012}Yelp really needs to update that menu, everything increased in price. The shio and shouyu ramen is now 9.50 and the miso ramen is 10.50 from what I remember. They also moved two doors down and when I went and saw the closed shutters, I got so scared (because I told my friend to meet me here for her birthday) until I saw the sign with the arrow. The customer service was great and the ramen came not even 5 minutes later! We both ordered shio ramen and it was kind of bland so we had to add lots of shichimi (the red spice stuff) and shouyu to even taste something. The ramen was kind of softer than I expected, but I guess that's the way it is? I'd rather go to Ippundo or Setagaya despite their prices if I want real good ramen. Rai rai ken is just good for their speed, nice atmosphere, and sort of cheapness, and if you don't like bold flavors, this is the place for you.
Guillaume T.}Manhattan, NY}31}46}9}-1}4}5/23/2012}you guys have to go to the new place. the ramen are delicious ,especially after a long day at the museum or a late nite of drinking. nothing better then a giant bowl of ramen.. thx rai rai ken to stand at my expectations.
Kristie C.}Palo Alto, CA}588}927}1162}18}1}5/22/2012}Nothing else was open - yes, this place is cheap and quick.. but I don't like hints of curry in my miso ramen. The mounds of onion, garlic, and oil were too much for me. MEH. Noodles tasted like packaged noodles.Perhaps I've been spoiled by the homey tastes of Totto and the delicious Ippudo.
Peggy W.}Los Angeles, CA}279}604}53}-1}2}5/20/2012}Ramen tasted like airport ramen. What is airport ramen you ask? - the kind of ramen you can get at like...LAX...or...any other airport. Soup that tastes like it came out of a soup packet. We tried za jiang mien - this was confusing. it said chilled noodles but what came out was...lukewarm. I'm guessing the noodles were chilled, then the sauce that went on top was hot, so the result was...well, lukewarm. Anyone from the Bay Area? Well, if you are, I was hoping for Himawari-esque (San Mateo) tan tan men and this just did not do it for me. Boyfriend tried shio wonton. Just didn't stand out. Like, at all. I like that they had a frequent eater's card, but sadly I won't be using mine.
John L.}Brooklyn, NY}1}7}0}-1}1}5/15/2012}i went in for lunch the other day and they took my order for a curry ramen and a small fried rice.  i got a shoyu ramen.  then i told the lady by accident i asked for a miso, but then corrected myself immediately and said "Curry Ramen". she nods to acknowledge the request for a curry ramen. i get a miso ramen.  i ask the cook to give me a Curry Ramen.  what i get next is totally unexpected.  i get told off by the lady "hey! why do you keep changing your mind?"  and i told her i ordered a curry ramen from the very beginning.  and then she says "oh no, i don't believe you! i think you're lying."  i lost my appetite after that.  after that experience, i will never come back to this establishment.  i've been a loyal customer for close to 4 years, but i wouldn't want anyone that i know or care about to be treated as viciously as i was.
Sean W.}NY, NY}507}128}11}-1}4}5/15/2012}As a ramen enthusiast, I'm always down to venture out and check out the best ramen shops in NYC! So, me and a friend decided to drop by Rai Rai Ken and try this little dive spot in East Village. This place is very cramped and is the epitome of a stereotypical Japanese ramen joint, but I guess that's how it retains its bohemian charm.The food however definitely makes up for it! We both ordered the Shio Ramen and shared a small order of the Pork Fried Rice, along with a bottle of Kirin. I gotta say the Pork Fried Rice is simply one of the best fried rices I have ever had and is a must! The Shio Ramen was also awesome! The broth was very flavorful, the noodles were nice and tender, although the toppings were meh. Overall, it was a great cheap meal, bill came out to $32. Worth going if you're ever around the area!
Esther A.}Sunnyvale West, Sunnyvale, CA}80}190}184}-1}4}5/10/2012}i have nothing more to add to the plethora of curry ramen posts. i love that you can request less/more salty!it's yummy, open late and service is impeccable - even at 11pm!
Jon K.}Brooklyn, NY}2}51}1}-1}4}5/2/2012}How have I not reviewed Rai Rai???This place is the real deal.  Cheap, quick, soul-nourishing just like we used to eat it in Japan.Place is tiny, don't come with a party larger than 3, and to be honest, better with a friend or solo.
KL Z.}Manhattan, NY}2}107}42}-1}1}4/30/2012}Curry Ramen was watery. I like mine with real curry sauce rather than curry powder mixing with soup. An acquaintance had shoyu ramen and it came with two thin slices of pork. We're New Yorkers. Serve New Yorker sizes. If your bowl is to have roast pork then serve more than just two measly slices. Who are you feeding? Children? Methinks not.
Joe L.}Jersey City, NJ}208}173}826}18}5}4/26/2012}Just had a great meal at the Tasting Event celebrating the grand re-opening of Rairaiken.Quick note about the decor... the restaurant is still a bit small, but certainly feels a lot more spacious than your usual ramen hole in the wall. Even the kitchen is a little bigger, 3 or 4 guys can man the various stations and waitresses can slip in and out without having to wedge themselves between sweaty cooks. The decor is a nice simple modernized upgrade, and the clever usage of mirrors makes the 20 person restaurant feel more like one that can seat 60. For the bathroom fanatics... there is a fully automatic bidet for your ass washing pleasure.Anyway, on to more pleasant topics... The menu for the night:- Fatty Pork Bun with a chilled noodle salad- Curry Ramen- Mango Tapioca PuddingI'm glad the world is finally coming around to embrace fatty pork. God its good. It melts in your mouth. I'll admit, this pork bun is not on quite the same level as Ippudo's Berkshire Pork Bun, but it's still pretty damn good. This one has a little veg to it, a sliver of lettuce and some straws of cucumber, but at least my wife will be happy I had some green in my meal.The curry ramen is very different here than anywhere else I've had it. I don't usually go for curry ramens in general, but I felt like something more hearty today and the standard shiyo or shoyu base. At other places, the curry is super thick, like the curry they put over your rice dishes. Rairaiken has a more liquidy curry broth and its actually a delightful broth to sip. It's still not a broth you would gulp down, but its certainly nice to be able to drink some of it and I believe the broth is an integral part to every bowl of ramen.The mango tapioca pudding... it was pretty excellent. The tapioca wasn't overcooked to the point that they became starchy balls, there was still a little bounce to them and they blended in with the mango pudding and coconut very well.I would definitely come back again!
Julia B.}Long Beach, CA}131}934}121}-1}3}4/26/2012}This once hole in the wall ramen joint has had a face lift with a more modern and larger space a few doors down. Decent ramen that will do the job. I like that they have Curry Ramen and that corn can be added as an additional topping.They have one of those fancy Japanese toilets with a heated seat and that will spray your nether regions in a variety of ways.Quick and friendly service.
Muir P.}New York, NY}15}17}0}-1}4}4/24/2012}After reading a review on the Immaculate Infatuation food blog, I decided to give this place a go on a hungover Saturday morning. The day before a couple co-workers were leaving the company. It was a gorgeous Good Friday. Work was somewhat slow. So we cut out at 4pm to enjoy happy hour outdoors somewhere. That post will come later...In the meantime, the day after I was NOT feeling well. It was another beautiful day out and I didn't want to waste it indoors, on the couch, watching bad TV and eating starchy carbs. I needed a substantial meal to heal my achy body and brain but didn't want to overdo it. I knew this place could do the trick. After a good walk from Chelsea I arrived expecting a crowd but since it was just me, I was hoping there would be a spare stool at their counter. I got lucky with few people there (I think they just opened) and sat right down. I ordered the miso ramen knowing the miso + salt + broth + veggies + noodles would sooth not only my head but my belly. I knew I wouldn't eat everything but I also ordered some kimchi. Fermented foods are very good for the belly when hungover. I am usually not crazy about kimchi but it was super fresh. Some can be smelly with a bizarre after-taste. This was not. I ended up eating it all. The miso ramen came in a very large bowl. Large enough I got two meals out of it. If you're there with a friend and want to try a few dishes, order a bowl of ramen - you'll have enough to share. The service was friendly and prompt. The bill was cheap. My head felt better. This is a great place to come solo with a book or with friends for an authentic and very affordable meal. In a great area of town with other small funky restaurants, cafes and shops.
Helen C.}Brooklyn, NY}83}409}1168}18}1}4/24/2012}Barely anything in the ramen. Expensive considering the lack of ingredients. Nothing special about the roast pork, kinda sad to even call it roast pork. Nothing special about their curry soup base either, kinda bland. I know space is limited because rent is expensive but seriously, the steam shouldn't be bothering customers trying to eat their food, even if it's subpar.
Constance A.}East Orange, NJ}157}386}507}18}4}4/8/2012}Ahh Rai Rai Ken. If you like ramen, this is the place should be on your list. I don't remember what specific ramen I order, but what I do remember is that it was delicious. You definitely get your money worth. The place is small. Not a lot of seatings.
Irene A.}Brooklyn, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}4/2/2012}The only place I've found so far that does curry ramen!  Curry ramen isn't really haute cuisine but it's such great comfort food, and I love the bowl they make here.  It comes with half a salty poached egg which is the best egg I've ever had, a couple slices of cha-shu, and some finely-chopped scallions.  It's a very simple recipe and their other bowls (shio. shoyu, and miso) are a lot more complex with more toppings, but man is it tasty.  Their cha-shu is very tender and flavorful, definitely one of the better ones I've had.  Their regular noodles are of fairly good quality, on the thinner end of the spectrum, and definitely better-cooked (not rubbery like at other places I've tried).  The special thin noodles that come with the shio ramen are exceptionally good, though, definitely the most toothsome noodles I've had in NYC so far.  And the broth is balanced just right for sipping, whereas at the other ramen places I've had so far, the broth is ok as a light coat over the noodles, but if you try to drink it you will have a heart attack from all the salt and fat.Also a great homey atmosphere.  Plunk down at the bar, tell one of the cooks your order, and then 3 minutes later the cook will set down a steaming bowl of ramen in front of you.  Now grab a pair of disposable chopsticks from the tray on the counter and dig in.  When you're done, set your bowl up on the higher ledge of the counter and the cook will take it away and give you your check.  Don't forget to get the stamp card!Even though this place isn't what one might consider the epitome of the art of ramen, I think it's got better ramen than many of the more famous (and dare I say, more pretentious) places in NYC.  It doesn't bill itself as some artisanal restaurant, and will do take out/delivery; but this lack of pretension is the core of the appeal of this restaurant: great home-cooked style flavors and textures -- the ultimate comfort food provided in an understated and efficient venue.  Oh yes, bonus points for the host/manager guy who was there the first time I went, who looks like a character from a bishounen manga come to life, with the bleached hair and the earring ;)
Sarah L.}Brooklyn, NY}4}40}0}-1}1}4/1/2012}Dont waste your money. Yes, it kind of cheap. But you'd be better off going to sunrise mart and making your own instant ramen. I got the spicy miso ramen. He got the curry ramen. Both broths were watered down and the noodles were inedible.
Angela G.}New York, NY}0}18}0}-1}3}3/30/2012}Eh. I'm really thinking "Meh, I've experienced better" but 2 stars seems rough. Rai Rai Ken is in my neighborhood which makes it a convenient spot. Easily said...you get what you pay for here. Noodles are okay and miso ramen flavor is really lacking. It tastes more like garlic ramen from the mound of crunchy garlic they top it with (which I have quickly learned to ask to be left out). The portions are pretty good for the price. Cash only and very limited seating at the location but it looks like Rai Rai Ken may have a new larger home a few doors down in the next few weeks/months. Will come back to see if a facelift has inspired them to step up their game... to be continued.
Lexi D.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}4}3/30/2012}CURRY RAMEN!! I love ramen and have become a connoisseur of east village ramen after my recent move. I have tried the momofukus and the ippudos and they are good. However, I have been searching for a whole in the wall type place. Rai Rai Ken is it! If you like Japanese curry then I highly suggest the curry ramen. The broth has a perfect balance of earthy and sweet curry flavors. The noodles, although not homemade, are tender and delicious. The scallions provide a perfect bite. The real test will be when I try a different ramen and the gyoza. But I thought about the curry ramen for the duration of my walk home. I think thats a good sign.
Eric L.}Brooklyn, NY}54}49}2}-1}3}3/28/2012}Good ramen. I ordered the Shio Ramen, which is a seafood soup base and it was amazing. The place is really crowded and somewhat uncomfortable but the price is cheap, and the food is good. Great for winters.
Soyoung S.}New York, NY}0}1}1}-1}1}3/28/2012}Food poisoning! My coworker and I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and he got diarrhea while I vomited that same night.
Christine E.}Jersey City, NJ}37}14}11}-1}4}3/26/2012}Let's be blunt here:  This is not the best ramen you can get in the city.  If you want "the best" or most authentic Japanese ramen, you should expect to pay at least twice as much as you would at Rai Rai Ken.What you CAN expect from this place is a good-quality bowl of ramen with generous toppings. I think the prices here are a real bargain for what you're getting.  Let's start with the bad:- I ordered the Shio ramen.  This immediately caused confusion on my part since the broth was a clear yellow-ish color with a lightly salty flavor.  I'm used to eating Shio ramen that's a milky white color with a deep, very salty flavor.  *shrug*  I wiki'd it and apparently Rai Rai Ken's version is more accurate to that description than what I've had in several other (much more authentic/expensive) restaurants.   It was an unexpected difference but I still enjoyed the steaming hot light yet flavorful broth with every noodle-filled spoonful.- The noodles are not made at the restaurant.  This explains the significantly cheaper price tag.  You can see the pre-packaged fresh noodles sitting on their counter.  I don't hold it against them as the noodles are still thick with good texture and flavor.  My only peeve is that I think they are just slightly overcooked.  - The place is small with Japanese-style counter seating.  So obviously, you may have to wait for a seat and when you do get one, it'll be a little tight on space.On to the good!- Portions are fantastic.  For $7.50 a bowl, you get a giant helping of some of the best comfort food you can find.  The bowl is so filled with toppings that you don't see the noodles underneath. The amount of noodles is significant with an equally satisfying amount of broth.- The service is fast.  You're sitting down, order your bowl and you're served within a couple minutes. I was also impressed with how beautifully the toppings were arranged. Of course, making a bowl of ramen is not a painfully long process when you already have everything prepared but I've waited at other restaurants to be served a bowl of what looked like a bunch of toppings thrown in random places on top of a slab of noodles before they slopped some broth into the bowl.  When the (totally not Japanese) cook put the bowl in front of me, I was immediately impressed by how inviting it looked.  -  Gyozas are good.  I wouldn't say they are the best I've ever had but they were super flavorful.  The wrappers used to make them were a bit flimsy for my liking but I still enjoyed them very much.  - Curry Ramen is SUPER good.  If I had known the Shio wouldn't be what I though it would, I would have ordered the curry ramen.  - And lastly, I cannot emphasize enough, the price.  Other restaurants will ask for $5 to add extra chashu, this place charges 3.  With a great selection of cheap additions, you can make your own ideal bowl of ramen at a more than reasonable price.Overall, an awesome place to grab a cheap dinner/lunch.  Definitely stamp your card to get a free bowl of ramen after 10 stamps.
Boris C.}San Francisco, CA}31}177}59}-1}4}3/25/2012}In the neighborhood? Want something satisfying for not a lot of dough? Can't go wrong here!Delicious ramen, and also tasty side dishes (try the pork; and the potstickers)A major plus point, oregon brewed japanese style beer.  Have one, or two!Great hole in the wall. Nice staff too.
Sy S.}Washington, DC}16}7}0}-1}4}3/17/2012}This is very close to ramen I remember from back home. Authentic Tokyo style. Must try.
Lily C.}New York, NY}3}141}43}-1}3}3/11/2012}Had the Miso Ramen and I say I can only give it three stars.  It's a lot richer than the other ramens offered.  I have to say the broth could be better but the portions are quite large for under 10 bucks.  I had extra pork topping since the miso ramen came with chicken.  One good thing is that it had bean sprouts and other crunchy vegetables to help balance it out. I can't say that this is one of the better ramen shops but it is worth a try for a different palette.  The place is pretty tight, hole in the wall joint.  Cozy but not so comfortable.  I wished the broth was a bit tastier.
Jan C.}Los Angeles, CA}149}55}60}-1}3}3/3/2012}Very crowded space, the staffs were really friendly and welcoming - however, not the most authentic Japanese ramen I've tasted. The soup can be a bit more rich. The meal fills you up, but not satisfying.
Anna S.}New York, NY}28}168}4}-1}4}2/26/2012}This place is absolutely addictive! I went here for the first time recently with a few friends not expecting much, since I have yet to understand the ramen craze. But I was pleasantly surprised when everything was flavorful and delicious. We started with some gyoza, which was great. The soup was rich and flavorful. The next morning, all I could think about was ramen.
M D.}New York, NY}4}113}271}-1}2}2/23/2012}Went here recently and was expecting a truly authentic Japanese ramen experience. Not so. While the decor and look of the place inside was very Japanese, I couldn't help but think it was very Chinese in taste and experience. Apparently, reading some reviews below, it seems be a Chinese-run ramen place. In that case, they should just make it a Chinese ramen restaurant. Everything was even served in bowls with motifs you'd see in a Chinese restaurant.The broth was not rich and hearty, but rather bland and soupy like a wonton broth. I got the dish with the ground pork, and really, it tasted like it was a chinese pork and tofu dish poured into a broth with noodles. The place also felt a tad grungy and a bit messy. Go to a place like Soba-ya or even Cocoron, and you'll see how clean it is in comparison. And how authentic the flavor and taste is.The one highlight was the gyoza. They were very lightly crispy and pan-fried and were delicious!While not horrible, it doesn't earn even 3 stars for me and it's not a place I'd tell a friend they must try. There are lots of great authentic noodle places around the area. You can copy a "style" of cooking, but if you are going to present it in all the wrappings of it being authentic, it better be authentic! Otherwise, you just disappoint your diners who, if they know their Japenese ramen, will know right away that they've been duped.

Casey Y.}Manhattan, NY}14}19}0}-1}4}2/10/2012}Hole in the wall, divey ramen bar...has to be good.  When there is a line outside, sometimes as long as Momofuku around the corner, you know you are in for something special.  The ramen options are all excellent, I personally prefer the Shoyu, but have tried them all.  The real surprise here, the fried rice.  It is buttery but light; just delicious.  There is a reason it appears as though the owners are opening a larger location on the same block, at least that's what the permits say.
Su W.}New York, NY}32}44}19}-1}3}2/9/2012}I came here after being heavily recommended by a friend that it is her favorite place for ramen and perhaps it is for this I had great expectation which became easily crushed. Rai Rai Ken is not a bad ramen store but it isn't one that stands out from the many ramen stores popping up. It is a very small place and from what I realized the sibling of next door's Curry-Ya. You'll find the usual ramens there: Shoyu, Shio, and one rare dish: Curry Ramen. I ordered Curry Ramen while my friend ordered the Shoyu. The ramen arrived promptly and we were digging in our ramen and at each other's to taste. The ramen tasted okay but as mentioned before nothing that stands out and make me go "omg this is different from the other places"! Even my Curry Ramen I feel lacks personality, so to speak. Is this a bad place? No. The food is good, the price are fair, the place may be small but very japaneseque like. And the service is friendly. But still I can't find myself giving it a 4 star. Basically my final message is that this is not a place I would recommend to a friend to specifically come and try out.If you're in the neighborhood and looking for ramen than yes I would recommend but if you're not and want excellent ramen, there are far better ramen stores WITHIN the vicinity.P.S: If you do find yourself liking this place I highly recommend you get the card and collect 10 stamps so that when you've completed the stamp card you'll get a free ramen. For iphone users there is an app called Stampt and only requires you to collect 7 in order to get the free ramen.
lore f.}Jersey City, NJ}21}195}17}-1}2}2/9/2012}Feels like a true Tokyo hole-in-the-wall in terms of how tiny it is... unfortunately the ramen is very sub par. They should rebrand as a fried rice place because their pork fried rice was actually quite tasty. but ramen....fail.
Thao L.}Brooklyn, NY}1181}330}4}-1}5}2/5/2012}If you're looking for ambiance, don't come here.It's a hole in the wall joint, that offers amazing ramen.First time I came here, I asked if I could have a couple more minutes to look at the menu...And the mexican guys in the back counter sternly said, NO. I was there for about 2 minutes before this occurred. Well.....Uh. UH.Second time around, I got the curry ramen. And it's easily the best cheap and hearty meal I've had in the E. Village.
Miles H.}Taipei, Taiwan}51}169}0}-1}3}2/2/2012}Good not amazing. The broth is on the soupier side, I ordered the curry ramen and was expecting a heartier broth, instead it was more soupy. Again, its good not amazing. Would I come back? Maybe.
Chris V.}Washington, DC}150}109}103}-1}4}1/31/2012}wowie wow wow ... so so lovely.A wonderful gem of a spot tucked in the east village, get their and be patient while waiting for your spot at the counter -- we were lucky and walked right in after a party of 3 left. With a limited menu, the general idea is that you can't go wrong with your selection and this was certainly the case here at Rai Rai.I was most thankful to overhear the guy to our left note that the fried rice was the best he had ever had ... I can now second that opinion. I prefer my fried rice to be on the drier side -- after all, it is "fried" ... so perfect, I practically dove into the bowl. As for the gyoza, meh ... a little mushy -- it had some nice browning to them but it lacked in the texture. Just not a winner as compared to the rest of the meal.We will most certainly be returning for more ...
Laura B.}New Orleans, LA}79}66}5}-1}4}1/28/2012}Japanese noodle bar. Only about 20 seats in the house, and all seats surround the kitchen. Divine smells and the broths in their soups are really great. Reasonably priced, hard to go wrong here. I've never found another noodle bar like it in NYC. Great atmosphere, even if it is a little crammed.
Michael C.}Manhattan, NY}8}54}3}-1}3}1/24/2012}I don't know why so many people swear by Rai Rai Ken. I used to live a few doors down the street and came here for late night chow. I never found the Ramen here special. The broth is on the light, thin side. I prefer a much rich flavor. In any case, to each's own. The fried rice is really good. I would order the half portion with a ramen. That should be enough.
Nyla I.}New York, NY}0}81}69}-1}2}1/23/2012}As a Miso Ramen lover, I've tried some of the best from Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New York... this place was the worst!  The broth hardly tasted like miso at all... it lacked flavor and was the most expensive ramen on their menu ($9)... I also disliked their hard seats, and the space in general... it is soooo small and squished. You should go try Ramen Misoya on 2nd and st marks!
Juan J.}Brooklyn, NY}106}705}187}18}4}1/22/2012}Me and my boy toy had the following on a chilly night:1) Chashu (sliced roast pork) - Tasty!!  Except they had way too much green onions under the meat and made the meat look like the side.  2) Shio Ramen and Curry Ramen were good.  Soup base was amazing. 3) Fried Rice - I was so glad that I ordered the full portion not the appetizer portion.  The rice is really good.   I think my boyfriend wanted to lick the bowl, but the fact we were on a date stopped him.My complain is why didn't they have a desert menu?  After devouring all the salty noodle and rice, I would KILL (literally) for some mochi ice cream!  Luckily, ChickaLicious is only mins away............Needless to say, we had a great night!
Mel K.}Brooklyn, NY}0}61}1}-1}2}1/19/2012}Doesn't quite hold a candle to the likes of Ippudo and Totto. Had the gyoza and Mabo Tofu Ramen (note the ramen dishes are obviously quite chinese influenced rather than traditional japanese). Gyoza was ok but the pieces were all stuck together, although tasty. Mabo ramen was ok but nothing about this place wowed me.
Michael T.}Fairfield, CT}3}49}0}-1}1}1/15/2012}Miso Ramen @ Rai Rai Ken Ramen- chicken, beansprouts, cabbage, scallions, misoRai Rai Ken Ramen belongs to the lowest tier of NYC ramen shops, unfortunately. The broth is made with chicken and flavored with Western (onion, carrot, leeks or scallions), rather than Japanese aromatics. Very lean, the broth lacks depth in both aroma and flavor. Also, the soup is served with extremely lean and dry white chicken meat, although char siu pork is available as an additional side, and for an extra charge. The topping are very pedestrian, if not less than that - shoyu based soup appears to be a bit more authentic, and spots pork, pickled bamboo and nori, unlike it's miso counterpart. And speaking about miso - Rai Rai Ken miso ramen does not have nearly enough of it, and as such misses on both saltiness and umami. The most enjoyable parts of this bowl are the temperature ( piping hot) and nicely made noodles, cooked just right and with enough of a nice firmness. Overall, this noodle shop is a disappointment on many levels - not recommended.Please take a look at the Rai Rai Ken Miso ramen here:flickr.com/photos/nickna…
Erica V.}Manhattan, NY}114}37}3}-1}1}1/4/2012}Judging by the reviews, it seems like this place might be a little hit or miss.  We definitely ate here on a miss night, because I really wasn't blown away by the food here.  It wasn't much better than Chinese take out that you could get anywhere and a few hours after eating here, my boyfriend and I both felt sick. Too scared to try it again.
Chibi H.}Milpitas, CA}1}15}9}-1}3}1/3/2012}I went there for their late lunch special for $11 that's from Mon - Thurs 2-5pm.  The lunch special comes with a bowl of (shio, shoyu, or curry) ramen and choose one from: 5 pieces of gyoza or small chahan (pork or seafood) or chashu (sliced roast pork).  It was a pretty good deal and I picked the shio ramen with the chashu.  The shio ramen was very light and I didn't like it that much.  I prefer a more flavorful broth that tastes like it's been boiling for hours.  I'm also more used to the soft boiled (onsen) egg with my ramen, but Rai Rai Ken served them hard boiled.  boooo....The chashu that came on the side was good, but it tasted more like a Chinese dish than Japanese style chashu.  It's served in a spicy soy sauce with green onion on top. This place is really small and made it a bit uncomfortable to enjoy the meal.  I was seated at the corner with my back right against another guy, and there wasn't any room to put my stuff.  Overall, it was OK. The food is a bit too Chinese style so it wasn't really my thing.
Jimmy C.}Manhattan, NY}207}173}17}-1}3}1/1/2012}Rai Rai is more like Meh Meh for me. Chinese Style Ramen is what it tastes like. That's not because that they are Chinese but just the way they make their broth and compile their bowls. It's still authentic and good but not a good ol authentic Japanese style ramen if thats what you are looking for. You still will get a good dining experience overall. FOOD:Authentic however too Chinese-y style ramen for my tastes. Maybe trying to be too innovative cramped their style. SERVICE:The chefs pretty much do all the service and its pretty fast at least when I come in. They are quick to serve you and I'm sure when their are high volumes of people it can really get behind.ATMOSPHERE:My favorite part, really hole in the way, but we-still-try-to-clean-it-up vibe i get from these guys.  Good job on the decor and making it feel like a nice homey feel.OVERALL:Great food, good atmosphere, price isn't overally excessive...just not enough Japanese-y for my tastes for ramen.  Better options out there.
S A.}Brooklyn, NY}140}179}34}-1}1}1/1/2012}I poop out better ramen than this place.Overrated.
Nina S.}Manhattan, NY}16}159}2}-1}3}12/30/2011}We started with the gyoza, which were absolutely delicious.  The wrapper was perfectly thin and the the pork & vegetables inside were moist and succulent.  I also had the shio ramen (with the seafood broth) and I thought it was really good as well.  Not best ever, but definitely hit the spot.
Lani P.}Paris, France}0}18}0}-1}3}12/29/2011}Had the shoyu ramen and it was just ok.  The broth didn't have any depth to it and I didn't really like the pork.My friend had the curry ramen though and enjoyed it.
Virginia Y.}San Francisco, CA}1590}1444}4566}18}4}12/27/2011}Very limited seating, but service is fast to make up for it! This place is almost like a hole in a wall. Quite the home-y atmosphere. I was seated facing the door. I got the curry ramen and shared menma with a friend. The curry ramen was full of flavor, the meat was tender I thought they were going to serve roast pork filled with fat but turns out it wasn't. It was lean meat. The noodles were tender and soft. I noticed that the advertise the shoyu ramen the most. I'll probably be back to try it. Compared to Ippudo, this place seems more reasonably priced.. it's about half the price of ippudo. The noodles taste about the same, the only difference would be the soup base. Yes, ippudo's soup is more flavorful but rai rai ken is still worth a try!
Laura Y.}Westport, CT}118}164}0}-1}4}12/21/2011}Rai Rai, you never disappoint. Yes, you're a very small place and the seating is, at best, cramped. Yes, there can be a wait, especially on a Thurs/Fri/Sat night.But I can forgive all that because your noodles are delicious, your broths are divine and your dumplings fresh, light and crispy. Better yet, your prices are dirt cheap.
Vi N.}Manhattan, NY}374}237}1000}-1}3}12/19/2011}On a super chilly manhattan day, we stopped in here to warm up w/a hot bowl of ramen! The place is super small, and there is only bar seating, so dont come rolling deep w/a group.I ordered the shoyu ramen, which had spinach, bamboo shoots, pork & an egg. The ramen was good, but I would have to say the ramen is better at Ippudo or Donburiya. The broth was tasty and flavorful. Overall, it was good enough to hit the spot on a cold cold day.
Henali P.}Manhattan, NY}152}187}49}-1}4}12/19/2011}The place is really tiny & they only take cash. Service is faster and the portions are big :) I had the Miso Soup Ramen. I had asked them to make it spicy and they did follow all the rules! I totally recommend this place as the food is definitely worth the price (under $10).
Seth G.}Manhattan, NY}1}20}0}-1}4}12/16/2011}Other than awkwardly having to shimmy my way through a row of people and coats hung up to pick up my order from the back of the store, everything else was great. Really big portion of flavorful ramen for a good price. Will definitely come back here again.
Amy R.}Brooklyn, NY}158}73}12}-1}4}12/11/2011}Delicious and easy on the wallet. But...I really wish it was more spacious. There are 12 cramped seats in this place. It is tolerable for a party of 2 to come together but definitely not the best place for conversation. It is a shame because the food is sooo good. The Chashu appetizer is a MUST! 4 delicious slice of roast pork for only $5! Definitely take the Chashu over the gyoza (nothing special about the dumplings). The Shoyu and Shio ramen are both delicious. I like putting the kimchee appetizer in there sometimes and some peppers to spice it up. The generous portions will definitely fill you up!
Yad L.}San Francisco, CA}211}362}450}18}3}12/3/2011}Rai Rai Ken is okay but I wouldn't cry if an Imperial Walker had to stomped over it either. Their ramen is so-so and the place is good enough for going alone or in a party of 2. Sitting at the counter is charming but terrible for conversing in a bigger size group.
Marina K.}New York, NY}347}311}68}-1}4}12/1/2011}When you're introduced to a ramen place by an Asian friend, you KNOW it's gonna be good. Rai Rai does not disappoint - their curry ramen is a winner in my book (hearty curry flavor but not too heavy/thick). The gyoza isn't anything special, but still a tasty accompaniment to this sodium-laden meal (I'll drink lots of water later, don't you worry). The place has maybe 12 seats total, so don't come here for a slow, leisurely meal - it's a get in, get out quick type of joint. FYI, they only take cash.
Sarah M.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}11/23/2011}Soooo delicious.  One of my favorite places in the city and the staff is always nice.  The fried rice is like really addictive and the noodles are great.  It is a little cramped, so probably not the best place for a party of 6, but if you have 2 people and want a great bowl of noodles definitely check it out.
Sandy Y.}Berkeley, CA}10}27}0}-1}3}11/3/2011}I ordered the Shio Ramen since it uses their house special seafood broth. The broth was very light (almost clear) and didn't have the richness that I was expecting. However, all the toppings (pork, egg, bamboo shoots) had lots of flavor in comparison so I made sure to balance the topping-to-noodle noodle ratio accordingly. The place is pretty small (maybe seats 10 people) but the service is really fast and there were quite a few take-out orders. It's a decent ramen at a reasonable price, and as a plus it's right down the street from ChikaLicious.  =)
Josh J.}Manhattan, NY}0}21}0}-1}2}10/29/2011}The ramen wasn't bad, but it gave me stomach problems, so I'm hesitant to rate this place higher and to try it again. Overall, Ippudo has better ramen.
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}4}10/24/2011}If you are expecting a traditional Japanese ramen restaurant, you have entered the wrong place. This restaurant is not Japanese by any means, but maybe a fusion of Japanese, and other Asian mixes such as Chinese. I came in here after a long day of working by myself. I had an appetizer portion of fried rice, and an order of curry ramen.The curry ramen was surprisingly good, also not too salty and the curry flavor did not over power the ramen noodles in the broth.The fried rice was my favorite. Even half portion filled me up really quickly and I'm surprised I devoured both in a matter of minutes!Service is weird and expected. The whole row in the back was empty. You just seat yourself, and the chef puts a water on your table. You place your order to the chef and thats it!In and out in 20 minutes.
H H.}Dublin, CA}69}457}124}-1}3}10/16/2011}I tried the shio ramen and the bamboo.  The ramen is solid, but nothing to rave about.  The place is amazingly small, and I came with a party of 5 and we actually didn't have to wait that long.  The ramen is also made in front of you which is nice.
Richard D.}New York, NY}134}1448}311}18}4}10/14/2011}I thought the ramen here was pretty solid.  It reminded me a bit of totto, but not as good.It's a solid option if you want ramen.  It's also another tiny ramen spot.  Good luck, you might have to wait a while.
Jason A.}New York, NY}60}77}9}-1}4}10/14/2011}This is a great place to satisfy your hunger cravings after a round or two of heavy drinking.
Dorothy W.}Princeton, NJ}74}142}39}-1}3}10/13/2011}My siblings love this place. I'm not sure why.It's a "cozy" petit place in St. Marks. You walk two steps through the cloth door and bam! You're at your seat. The entire staff appears to be cooking or at least working behind the counter. I'm a bit claustrophobic so I wasn't too pleased with the limited seating. The staff was nice and catered to us quickly. Of course, I had ramen. Food took about 10-15 minutes, which was great. You get a big bowl of noodles in some broth with other miscellaneous items. My sister kept raving about it, but I didn't taste anything magical. The beef was a bit tough (no, I did not let it sit for long), noodles are just noodles, and I guess the broth was somewhat good. Not as artificial as other ones. The total was $25 including tips for the both of us. Not too bad, but I think I would've had a better time at home with top ramen. JUST SAYING!
Vicky L.}Jersey City, NJ}783}903}409}18}4}10/10/2011Updatedreview}I haven't been to Rai Rai Ken since my first review of this place in 2008, but I stopped by last week because the weather has gotten colder in the East Coast, which, for me, means it is officially RAMEN SEASON.To everyone else, the holiday season starts around Halloween and ends after New Year's.  For me, my favorite time of the year begins on the first cold day in September and ends just after "hung over" brunch on January 1 of the next year.  When the the first bite of cold air nips me, I know my favorite time of the year is about to start - and I begin by drinking and eating food items that are warm.So for me, Fall starts with that first bowl of Ramen, hence the beginning of RAMEN SEASON.My first bowl this year was at Rai Rai Ken, and I don't know if it is because I have been on a Ramen hiatus all summer or if I just didn't review this place properly last time, but I really really liked it this time around.What I like about Rai Rai Ken is that it is simple.  As I am becoming older and infinitely wiser, these are the things that I am really beginning to cherish.  I used to love menus that encompassed everything, until I realized that oftentimes those menus cook NOTHING well.  At Rai Rai Ken, even the decor begins simply, the interior of the restaurant is wooden and all you have is a counter with about 4 chefs/waiters and about 10 - 12 seats around that counter.  You order your food, watch your food being cooked, and then you are served your food in the same motion.The menu is simple too - 5 or 6 standard appetizers and 4 types of broth.  It's as if mom asked you, "What do you want for dinner tonight?"  and you know it is just those couple of things that mom does extremely well and whatever you choose will hit the spot completely.So on this particular occasion, I ordered the Gyoza, the CharShu, and the Shoyu Ramen.  The Gyoza was decent, there was nothing that special to write about unfortunately, the skin was a bit too soggy for my taste and I didn't think the stuffing had enough flavor, but that is a preference issue, I suppose.The Char Shu on the other hand was delicious and worth spending a couple of sentences on.  First off, the presentation of it was mouth wateringly gorgeous: four generous pieces of soft, fatty Char Shu topped with marinated scallions on top.  If we could eat with our eyes, I would have inhaled that into my eyeballs in 5 seconds.  What impressed me the most though was that not only was it mouth wateringly tempting, it also tasted really good.  The pork was soft and buttery, with just enough soy sauce to make it enjoyable on its own or with ramen.That's the thing about Ramen too for me, the piece of pork that it comes with is never enough.  That's why I almost always order a side of CharShu ( because it's way cheaper than ordering extra pork )  so I get extremely disappointed if the Char Shu does not compliment my Ramen.  In this case, it absolutely did.  It was better than the one in my Ramen actually.So that being said, let's move on to the Ramen and the subject of interest this evening.Because of its simplicity - shoyu broth ( not too salty, perfect for drinking), one piece of pork, bamboo shoots, one piece of seawood, spinach, and a fish cake with the naruto swirl, and the fact that I was sitting on a stool facing a counter, I felt like I was eating out but enjoying a home cooked meal.  I don't know if I explained that properly, but that is what Rai Rai Ken feels like to me.  A place to go when you feel like eating home cooked food ( which to me isn't always perfect ) but you don't have to be home to eat it.  It does a great job of emulating that experience.And, that, is the reason I will definitely go back.
Juliet S.}Manhattan, NY}58}7}8}-1}5}10/8/2011}They make excellent vegetarian miso ramen while a lot of other Japanese restaurants have nothing for vegetarian. Great taste, good price, warm atmosphere.
Penelope P.}New York, NY}15}107}28}-1}2}10/3/2011}Disappointing ramen.I wish my favorite ramen joint did a ramen rewards card like Rai Rai's!
Remy S.}Brooklyn, NY}63}46}60}-1}2}9/24/2011}There seems to be a formulaic approach (refer to Lowie T.'s almost-PC and other reviews) to running these knock-off-type eateries--specifically "Japanese" ramen shops in the city.  Ordered the Shoyu and Shio ramen which contained the same basic ingredients, the difference being the color of the broth.  Clean-tasting and not super glycerin-y but nothing memorable or impressive in terms of flavor.  Noodle texture was decent (as it should be).If the cheesy pop music doesn't keep you entertained, you can ponder on that fact that a paper-thin slice of pork, 1/2 a soy-sauce toughened egg and sliver of fish cake will set you back~$10-12 per serving.  Meh.
Brian B.}Manhattan, NY}4}20}2}-1}3}9/24/2011}the fried rice was pretty good. same with the dumplings
Hillary W.}New York, NY}315}61}2}-1}4}9/20/2011}Really love the miso ramen! I love the small setting and the smell is amazing. I try to go here as often as I can. Great late night food.

Lowie T.}Manhattan, NY}72}264}24}-1}2}9/15/2011}a small counter space only venue, it definitely gives a feel of an authentic japanese ramen shop....until you look up. there is something unauthentic about your ramen "chefs" not being japanese....let alone not being even asian! in an effort to be PC, let's move on to the food.the shoyu ramen was my ramen of choice. the broth was ok, not too much depth in flavor. the noodles were not soft but not a firm al dente either. and my poor egg looked like it had been cooked one too many times. i see a lot of mixed reviews on this place, so i am definitely going back and looking forward to hopefully an updated review!
Derek K.}Manhattan, NY}719}19}0}-1}4}9/11/2011}food: 4/5decor: 3.5/5service: 4/5Came here on a rainy Thursday. Looking for something to cheer me up. Ramen always hits the spot. This place did the job.Staff was friendly. I love the ramen bar feeling. Very authentic ambience.Food came in like 8 minutes. I didn't mind. Just scrolling on the yelp reviews while I waited to prep myself for the awesome noodles. The chef finished it, peeked open the curtains blocking him and his arms extended down to place the noodles front of you. BAM. SHIO RAMEN. hat's when the whole experience started. I snapped a couple of pics to send to foodspotting and dug in. First spoonful of broth, I dug it. First bite of noodles, solid. It was fairly priced. 8.50. Then, I just went through the crunchy bamboo shoots, soy-marinated, hard-boiled egg, thick cut of roast pork, spinach, fish cake, and seaweed. I will come here again. and again. and again. Great work, Rai Rai Ken!
Brian Y.}Manhattan, NY}165}6}0}-1}4}9/4/2011}this is becoming my go to ramen house. not just because its a few blocks south of where i live. the small amount of seats is perfect for what i want in a ramen house, especially when they are all centered around the kitchen and the cooks. its intimate without being oppressive, the staff is charming and food is excellent.its a small menu, so don't expect anything crazy. just great ramen and excellent broth. the prices are great for the size of the bowl but remember to bring cash, no cards here.i'm not sure what else to say other than just go, sit at the bar in front of the chefs while the work and hand your food directly to you. slurp down some noodles and enjoy a beer. its worth waiting, i promise.
Amaya S.}Manhattan, NY}116}120}17}-1}4}9/3/2011}Its a good place, cheap and pretty good, I personally find the proportions are only big by NY standards.....california ramen kicks nys ass in every way. But this is a decent spot if ur in the area, and have cash handy...the gyoza is good, but honestly i think they are stingy with toppings in the ramen.
Anne C.}Brooklyn, NY}37}48}1}-1}3}8/25/2011}This place is small. Looks really hole in the wall, which made it feel authentic. Fast service. There is so much food that I always end up taking half in a carryout container. Ippudo tastes a lot better but the wait is always 2 hours long there.
May L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}591}464}229}18}3}8/21/2011}Rai Rai Ken gets a 3.5 on my Search for the Best Noodles in NYC.  In the category of Ramen Noodles, it's a solid entry, but no first place finisher. Atmosphere:  Definitely not good for groups of more than 2.  This place is small.  You sit on a stool and are served by the guys behind the counter.  They are really nice, but wow, what a tough job!!I got the chicken option. It was ok. The chicken was a bit dry.  There wasn't quite enough green to make me happy.  I really wish they would have had more options vs. just 3.  This would have made me consider that i just chose the wrong bowl of noodles.Their take on siu mai is a pretty solid thing to check out.  One day when I do the great dumpling search, I'll come back and give these a 4.  That along with service is really why they are a 3.5 in my mind. But I round them down because of all the hype.
Nga C.}Brooklyn, NY}497}443}1783}18}1}8/18/2011}One of the things I absolutely hate most is when a restaurant pulls that old bait and switch and play tricks on me, only to leave me feeling empty handed and insulted for actually forking over a decent amount of cash for something they didn't advertise.I'm sorry to say, but this restaurant is a huge fake and it aint no Ippudo or even remotely close to it. On the outside and inside, this restaurant looks authentic and chic and the presentation looks great.  But once you taste their ramen, you'll realize it's nothing but a rip-off from the real deal. Their Shoyu ramen broth tasted nothing more then something you find in a wonton soup at a fast food Chinese restaurant. Their single slice of pork was dry and flavorless and their fish cake was paper thin. The only thing that was decent was their actual ramen and that my friend is totally not worth dishing out $9.25 for!!Personally it's moments like this, when I'm actually grateful for living in NYC, where my choices of restaurants are grand and not having to go here is an option!!
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}3}8/12/2011}Their Hiyashi Chu-Ka is really good! It's a cold noodle dish served with vinegar flavored soy sauce broth, chicken, cucumber, ginger, sun dried tomatoes, seaweed, scallion and eggs. I have never tried this dish before so I don't know if other places have better ones, but this was pretty good nonetheless: it tastes really light and fresh, and it feels really healthy since it is served with a huge amount of vegetables. Their Shoyu Ramen is ok too, but the broth somewhat lacked flavor. The noodles on the other hand were decent and the pork was very soft and delicious. The food is served very fast and it is reasonably priced. I would visit again if I am feeling like having a fast, cheap meal around the neighborhood, although their noodles are definitely not on par with some of the other places in the city (Ippudo, Totto Ramen).
Mike K.}Seattle, WA}89}147}91}-1}3}7/26/2011}Nothing hits the spot on a frigid, cold day quite like a piping hot bowl of ramen, which is exactly why weekly ramen descended on Rai Rai Ken in 100-degree weather. We're kind of dumb like that. In my Totto review I mentioned that the bar there dominated the restaurant, but that now seems like a hyperbolic statement when compared to Rai Rai Ken, which is only bar. Forget about sitting at a table - they don't exist.Left waiting at the altar once again without a tonkotsu option on the menu, I finally broke down and ordered the curry ramen. Since Japanese curry tastes more or less the same no matter where you get it - it's all made from the same blocks of roux - I know it isn't helpful in evaluating a restaurant's broth, but I'm a curry fiend and I couldn't help myself. Scott more sensibly ordered the shio, which is made with a seafood base.All the same, I was happy with the curry broth and really pleased with the noodles, which were cooked al dente. Everything was going really well, we were getting to know each other better and I was considering the possibility of a fourth star and a second date when, out of nowhere, disaster struck!The pork, oh, the sad, sorry state of the pork. Flavorless? Check. Overcooked and rubbery? Check and check. One, single, solitary piece? Nixon's dog. It was bad news bears and immediately dashed any hope of this being anything more than a casual hookup with this ramen joint.Scott had a similar experience with the shio; that broth was okay, but not special. The seafood fried rice we ordered on the side was also solid.Rai Rai Ken is affordably priced - at under $9 a bowl it's cheaper than any of its better-known neighboring ramen joints in the East Village. They also get brownie - mochi? - points for playing Beatles the entire time.I'd probably call on Rai Rai Ken if I were in the neighborhood, had a few drinks in me was feeling hungry and looking for a cheap good time. Every now and then you just need something like that.Instead of weekly ramen we should have done weekly ice cream in this weather. Oh wait, we've been doing that all along after the ramen. We're kind of hungry like that.
John W.}Houston, TX}215}130}310}-1}4}7/21/2011}This is my number 2 spot for ramen (Ippudo NY is number 1).  They have awesome ramen, the wait isn't that long, and their fried rice (with extra butter) is insanely good.  The place is ultra cute too!  Would I go back?  of course!
Emily T.}Philadelphia, PA}401}34}0}-1}4}7/19/2011}Rai Rai Ken was the first of many NYC ramen adventures for me. It's one of my favorites for the affordability, the ambiance & the clean, lighter taste of its ramen. Unlike Ippudo, where I am forced to endure weak, thin noodles and to feel like an ungrateful little Asian girl for not finishing the enormous bowl of thick, creamy broth, Rai Rai Ken's shio ramen left me full and satisfied. The noodles are exactly what they should be: springy and not too thin, but not too thick either. The broth is light enough to be satisfying but not overwhelming. True to ramen tradition, the bamboo shoots, hardboiled egg and pork were all cooked perfectly. It's a good, traditional, standard bowl of ramen--nothing terribly daring, super satisfying, and at about 9 bucks, won't set you back too far. Come alone or with only 1 other person, sit at the bar closer to the back, and enjoy your ramen on days when you just need some good, solid, comfortable food.One more thing: get the shio and not the shoyu. Shio's broth is seafood-based, I think, and is lighter than the shoyu, which is soy sauce-based and very, very salty.
Quan N.}Manhattan, NY}83}17}0}-1}2}7/15/2011}Very ramen shop in nature. Small, quaint, bustling at times. Cool entrance. I ordered the Shio Ramen. Unfortunately, it's broth and noodles were similar to the instant variety. It could've just been a bad day and maybe the cook was cranky. Perhaps I should try a different bowl next time.At least the prices were cheap compared to other places.
Aude P.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}11}27}3}-1}5}7/14/2011}my favorite Ramen place. I've known this place for 7 years and I consider myself a regular. I always get the Miso Ramen with butter and corn. This is amazingly good!
Denis L.}New York, NY}0}17}0}-1}3}7/5/2011}Always satisfying. Great broth good portions. A regular stop for me.
Garrett P.}Queens, NY}430}326}29}-1}3}7/2/2011}My experience here could be summed up by my generation's contribution to the vocabulary of ennui:  'meh'.The noodles were good, but there weren't enough of them, the pork was just a single slice, and same thing on the fish cake. The broth was great, but why did I pay $9 for it again? Additionally, while I don't mind the communal seating at ramen/udon joints, this place had me feeling like a circus midget in a clown car.
Christie C.}KEW GARDENS, NY}1}16}2}-1}5}7/1/2011}I am 100% convinced that any bad reviews for this place, at least as far as the quality of the food, are written by regulars who are trying to cut down on the number of people who are almost always forming a long line outside.  Rai Rai Ken is amazing.  Period.  It is the best and most authentic ramen in the city.  It is not tourist-y and it is not overpriced.  It is consistently delicious.  But you can choose to believe me or not because, frankly, I also wouldn't mind if the crowds were smaller so I could get to my ramen faster--yum!!
Giacomo C.}New York, NY}1416}1146}1908}18}4}6/19/2011}Great ramen! I love the place, I love the vibe, I liked the service and I loooved the food. A great neighborhood place.Will go back!:-)
Saara H.}Manhattan, NY}80}136}0}-1}2}6/14/2011}I love ramen and was so excited to go to Rai Rai Ken but, unfortunately, was sorely disappointed. The ramen isn't horrible but it certainly isn't good. And the gyoza are terrible, really. It's not expensive but really not worth going out of your way for. If you have a real ramen craving, I would try Totto Ramen instead. One redeeming quality is the fact that Chikalicious, a cute dessert spot, is right across the street.
Stephen S.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}6/13/2011}This is the real deal. Inexpensive, fast and legit. If you want a noodle experience, come on in. Cash only, small, a revolving door of people who prefer something that isn't particularly tourist/stroller friendly.Summertime, so the Curry Ramen might not sound as appealing as when it's chilly, but I'm sure it's every bit as delectable.
Lili K.}Manhattan, NY}286}2518}159}-1}4}6/9/2011}We were on our way to another ramen spot, but found this hole-in-the-wall, which yelpers love to check out!  So we stopped on by-it's pretty much just a row of barstools that are stuck to the floor, and seats about twelve people.  The cooks are also the servers, and you can see how it's all done.I got the Miso Ramen and asked them to make it spicy (they gave me some sauce and flakes which did the trick).  My boo got the Curry, which definitely had a distinct curry flavor to it (some places, like when they have Curry Tofu Soup, don't have it too strong).  He liked his, whereas mine was just pretty good.Chill spot, not too pricey, and low-key.  And if you take their card and get 10 ramens, you get the 11th for free :P  Oh, and cash only, of course.
Luvlymui i.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}20}74}0}-1}3}6/8/2011}Finally came here on a quiet sunday evening and was able to get seats. The place was tiny but that like the "thing" for ramen shops? the smaller the more authentic it may be? I got the seafood soup base ramen so it was pretty light, the pork was soft and that's how I like it. There was plenty of scallion and seasoning on top and the noodle was good. I think everything is ok, better than a lot of the franchise ramen places in st.marks. I will come back if I am around and craving ramen but I wouldn't make the trip just to come here.
Cliff K.}West Hollywood, CA}131}81}14}-1}2}5/21/2011}Bleh.  I have yet to find a great ramen place in New York City.  This is another one that fails to leave an impression.  I ordered Shio Ramen.  It comes in a decent size.  But the first thing you notice is this.  One piece of pork.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!  ONE??  Then you're asking... is it at least a thick piece of Chashu?  Nope.  It's thinner than a slice of beef jerky.  Come on.  The broth isn't tasty.  It's tastes... clean?  for lack of a better word.  I want my broth to be tasty, juicy, a little oily and i guess fatty.  It was thin.  The place is tiny.  I mean... it'l fit at most... 12 people at a time?  Don't come expecting something great.  It's solid on a cold day, but definitely not worth going out of your way to get there.
Angie K.}Singapore, Singapore}1254}427}263}-1}4}5/19/2011}The inside of the restaurant parallels that of Totto Ramen's. It's a hole in the wall. With that said, I can't say the ramen was better. While the ramen (both Miso and Shoyu) had clear broth which is a MUST in my book (no pork fat grease, please), it was just "good." Nothing special or unordinary. If you want good enough ramen on those days when you just crave one, go here. Otherwise, go to Totto or Ippudo.
rachel k.}Manhattan, NY}8}5}0}-1}4}5/18/2011}Delicious, cozy ramen!  My husband turned me on to Rai Rai Ken--it's one of his favorite places to eat, and now it's mine too.  The service is quick, and I think they do a good job of seating you in their small space.  The curry ramen reminds me of childhood...a much more pleasant version of the curry my mother used to make.  The crispy garlic on top of the miso ramen is so so good!  The edamame is just right, and the kimchee is pretty good too.
Anna S.}New York, NY}47}41}6}-1}4}5/17/2011}The haters don't know what they are talking about and don't know anything about authentic Japanese ramen.  Rai Rai Ken is not a scene-y place to eat.....it is a purist institution; a place for lovers of ramen (or the hungover) to go and focus on shoving yumminess into their mouths.Ambiance:It is best to come to Rai Rai Ken with as few people as possible.  I mean it.  4 people is really pushing it.  This is a great place for grabbing a meal by yourself, or to come with a friend you want to catch up with.  The dining area is a single bar, with all of the cooking space on the other side of it.  Other patrons walking to the end of the space to access the restroom will brush up against you - that's how intimate (small) it is....but have you ever been to Tokyo? Food:Is it the best ramen I've ever had in my life? No.  But it is consistently very VERY good.  I wish the noodles were just a little bit firmer.  All of the ramen variations are delicious, but I am partial to the broth in the miso ramen.  It doesn't come spicy, but there are plenty of condiments for customization. The appetizers are also consistently great.  I especially love the edamame because they serve them super hot and fresh and never ever mushy, overcooked or soggy, and they always have such a perfect sprinkling of rock sea salt.  The gyoza are another favorite, because they are excellent dumplings to start with, but they always get a good sear on them so the texture is perfect.Take-out is ok,  but the food definitely does suffer a bit. Even so, I still used to pick up anytime I was sick when I lived in the area.Summation: If you want some more personal space and some hotspot ambiance, then by all means, go to Momofuku or Ippudo and spend $30+ per person, plus drinks.  If you want to fill your belly with some guaranteed good ramen in a cozy spot, come to Rai Rai!
Jane K.}San Francisco, CA}4452}1215}1901}-1}4}5/17/2011}What's the perfect salve to a chilly, rainy day in Manhattan? A trip to Bermuda. Okay, well if you can't swing a trip to warmer clims then at least drown your sorrows in a piping hot bowl of ramen. Rai Rai Ken is sandwiched in a row of Japanese restaurants on 10th Street in the East Village, serving out gyoza, fried rice and ramen from an intimate "kitchen"-facing countertop. While it's not a swim up pool in Cancun, I do get the distinct feeling that I've stepped into another land as soon as I'm through the door. The dim lighting and collection of only a few low stools make this the perfect place to bring a date, though you should note that they cannot accommodate groups. Better to bring your bevvy of pals next door to Shabu Tatsu then even attempt it. To date, I've only had the Shoyu ramen which all said adds up to roughly $9.25. Not the cheapest noodle joint around, but the soy-sauce broth, al dente egg noodles and slow-cooked pork slices that fill those big bowls do not disappoint. Have had better? Yes. Do I keep coming back? Yes. Definitely worth a stop on your East Village ramen rounds. It's sure to warm up that belly in a jiffy.
Carmela B.}New York, NY}61}23}1}-1}5}5/7/2011}I have nothing but love for this little hole in the wall. They serve some seriously good ramen. Bf and I come here when we don't want to wait for Ippudo. You gotta go! You wont' regret it :)
Andre A.}Bethlehem, PA}1}8}3}-1}2}5/7/2011}I been looking for a good ramen place in the city and decided to try this one out because of the reviews. Went there Tuesday around 6:30pm and it was empty. I asked the for an order of their most popular dish (Miso Ramen) and only took about 5 minutes to prepare. What a dissappointment it was. The chicken was shredded which was good but for some reason it was dry and lacked any flavor. Also the broth had no flavor. It's good that they didn't just throw in a ton of salt like other places do but it was just to bland. The Miso Ramen cost me $9 before tax/tip. Maybe if the head chef (who was japanese) prepared it instead of the cook it would of tasted better but the chef was to busy chatting with his waitress. Unlike most of the other japanese places I goto, I was never greeted as I walked in which I found strangely odd.
Jordan H.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}5}27}1}-1}4}5/4/2011}Love the ramen here.  Very small place with great ramen for a cold day.  The noodles/broth have great flavor with great portions.  I've been back many times and has become my staple for ramen in the EV.
Rebecca K.}New York, NY}22}170}0}-1}4}5/4/2011}This place is AWESOME! I came here spontaneously with a friend post-yoga one night, we both had a ramen craving. This place is a tiny, literally, hole in the wall, with maybe 15 seats tops around the bar-type seating which surrounds the kitchen. The whole place is probably the size of a large bedroom (including kitchen). We sat right down, ordered our ramen (both went with the soy-based traditional ramen), got it very quickly, and were very very very pleased. I have been to a lot of ramen places in this city, and this is one of the clear winners. Very fresh, not too salty, and the noodles were perfectly cooked (a bit al dente). As a local, I'll definitely return. It's also very reasonable. Less than $10 for a large bowl.It appeared that everyone around us may have been a regular. We looked around us and wanted to try what everyone else was eating too, it all looked so good! Kim-chee, Cold ramen noodles, gyoza, etc. Will definitely come back here.To note:-Don't come here with more than 1 other person. This place is TINY and because you sit at the bar, I can't imagine coordinating dinner convo with multiple people-Cash only, but very cheap!
Alaine H.}Singapore, Singapore}661}286}358}-1}4}5/4/2011}Can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet. A favorite ramen spot in the E. Village of me and the boyfriend. Rai Rai Ken reminds us of the little ramen shops in Japan. The bowls of ramen never disappoint and it comes hot and steaming. I always crave a good bowl of ramen when the weather gets frigid. One of my favorite memories is coming here on a Saturday night after a long day of skiing in Vermont.
Amy L.}New York, NY}233}54}3}-1}4}5/2/2011}Solid choice for days when you're craving ramen but are 1. too lazy to wait in line at Ippudo or walk to Minca, and 2. want to save some $$. It's small, unpretentious, great for a quick dinner with a friend or a meal alone. All their ramen options are fantastic - try the mabo or curry for something different!
Deric C.}San Diego, CA}8}29}1}-1}4}4/26/2011}of all the ramen places i've been to in EV, this one nails the asthetic of the tokyo ramen house best. solid ramen!
peter k.}Brooklyn, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}4/23/2011}I have eaten ramen at a lot of places and this is my fav. I usually order the miso ramen with extra pork and my gf gets the miso with extra corn. We almost always get the gyozo as well. chewy noodles and salty pork mmmmmm....
Miss M.}Long Island City, NY}1}16}2}-1}5}4/19/2011}People have to realize that this place does not use MSG. Therefore, its not going to be like all the other noodle places you have eaten at cuz its not going to be full of all that msg stuff you are used to. if you can't appreciate this place then dont come back cuz there are many of us who absolutely adore this place and takes it for what it is. Its small and packed which is how it is in Japan when you go to one of those noodle places. The noodles and soup are DELICIOUS. i always crave this place and i have to say its my most favorite ramen place in nyc because after eating here i feel healthier than eating at the other noodle places. I def give it 5 stars. If you're not a snob you're going to enjoy this simple noodle joint and appreciate the authenticity of the food.
Geoffrey N.}New York, NY}77}150}8}-1}4}4/17/2011}Yes another ramen review.  I'll make it short and sweet.  Definitely your hole in the wall ramen joint.  Pretty small selection of shio and shoyu ramen with their own spicy ramen.  Lunch special combs aren't valid on Fridays (argh!!).  Not the best but not the worst.  Ramen is chewy and of course the broth was great.  I know it's great, i drank all of the soup.  I just wish they had better lighting...it's a little depressing...but other than that, i'm definitely coming back to harass them for more!
Annie C.}Manhattan, NY}9}76}2}-1}5}4/14/2011}For ten dollars, you get a giant bowl of ramen. I love the original shoyu ramen - so delicious. I've never tried the curry although I've always wanted to. This place has much tasiter ramen than Ippudo for half the price. Though... they don't have the pork buns...
Helen W.}Jersey City, NJ}46}277}2}-1}3}4/11/2011}I had the seafood ramen.  There wasn't much stuff in it. It's just plain ramen with an egg, fishcake, seaweed and a piece of roast pork.  The soup was very clear though.  It wasn't full of MSG.
Gracie h.}Brooklyn, NY}2}68}1}-1}3}4/10/2011}ramen was mediocre. based off the yelp ratings i would've expected better.... but still... i love ramen.....
Ben M.}New York, NY}107}107}19}-1}5}4/4/2011}I don't understand bad reviews for this place.First off, the place is very small, not good for groups or large parties.  The seating is tight and the bar you sit/eat at is right in front of where they cook.  The interior is very cool and personally, even at over 6', I find the intimacy of the place very enjoyable.They have a menu of about 12 items.  6 or so ramens and 6 appetizers.  I usually get the curry ramen though I've tried everything on the menu.  The appetizers are so-so, some being better than others (it is hard to eff up edamame). The ramens are all excellent and have very different flavors.I think if you know what you are getting into as far as the space in this place is concerned and you like trying new things and having unique experiences the you will like this place also.If you don't like the sound of eating here, then just order delivery..they are very fast.
Florence Y.}Brooklyn, NY}261}331}22}-1}2}3/30/2011}If you are skinny, or somewhat regular-sized and enjoy being jabbed in the ribs while having so-so ramen noodles, go ahead and walk right in.This was option B cause Ippudo was a 1.5hr wait and we didn't have time. Since it was on Dine for Japan flyer, we decided to give it a shot.Bar style with 4 mini seats facing the street. You definitely have to petite Asian to fit in those seats. There was one seat against the wall, facing the bar that sucked, cause the wood-style bar top was jutting out, poking whoever in the ribs while they tried to enjoy dinner. Noodles were sooooooooo disappointing. I had the miso ramen, probably the worst I've ever had to pay for at a restaurant. The waiter forgot my additional $3 pork, which I had to ask for. At least it was a decent portion....not roasted, and cold. My friend had the curry ramen which she polished right up...the portions were not consistent. Food sucked, service was....trying. I felt utterly disappointed. And amazed there were people actually waiting in line!Tip-bits:Wait in line for other ramen places nearby. Prices were decent, but then again..the quality....Cash onlyHooks on the wall for coats
Jules D.}Hudson, NY}40}68}9}-1}5}3/29/2011}Been going here for years. Delicious ramen with fresh ingredients, everything homemade. Unpretentious, great service. Can't say enough good things about the place. The Shio Ramen is unbelievable! Not only that but you get a stamp card and every 10th ramen is on the house. Definitely my go to for great ramen in NYC.
Kitana Q.}Manhattan, NY}0}189}0}-1}3}3/28/2011}Cute ramen bar tucked away in the EV with a stamp loyalty card!  Should have eight more ramen bowls...1. Food: I knew I should not have gotten the curry ramen.  Was disappointing: broth salty, but the ramen was well cooked.  Yakisoba was good too.  Feeling ambivalent about the gyoza - ambiguous mixture of veggies and mostly absent meat wrapped in thin and delicate skin - tenderly cooked and wonderfully crispy.  2. Service: Average.  3. Atmosphere: Mellow.  Red walls and narrow bar.  A bit cold in the wintertime, as the wind rushes in with every push of the door.
Lucien H.}New Haven, CT}8}51}0}-1}5}3/22/2011}This place gets a pass on any judgement due to its phenomenal gyoza. Japanese dumplings done exactly right, there is no other place in my heart like the taste of these gyoza. Thin pastry, right amount of scallions. Veggie or meat, these dumplings will blow you away. Take one or two friends, no more and be ready to be the guy (or gal) that is known as the one in the know. Peace.
Curtis W.}Virginia Beach, VA}235}202}34}-1}3}3/21/2011}This is my wifes favorite Ramen place. It ranks about third on my list. Good thing we have a strong bond in our marriage cause it's shit like the differences in Ramen spots that can lead to divorce. I guess I need to give it another try and get the Miso, supposedly that's where its at. I had the Shoyu Ramen, and it fails in comparison to the likes of Minca and Ippudo.
som p.}Venice, CA}106}58}12}-1}3}3/14/2011}i'm giving this place 3 stars since my shoyu ramen wasnt that great but i did like my seafood fried rice though. this place is very very small. your back is pretty much almost against the wall so its kinda hard to sit for a while and talk and eat! I love eating ramen but would prolly go somewhere else plus they gave me only one piece of pork!  its always weird when its non-japanese chefs preparing the ramen for you! def a good spot if you are looking for some quick and cheap ramen!
Geoff S.}New York, NY}12}11}0}-1}5}3/10/2011}This is my favorite Ramen place in the city. Super tasty noodles and broth, good pork (although nobody beats Momofuku's pork belly... sorry!) and the atmosphere is fun (big long ramen bar that feels like you are crammed into a tiny ramen-ya in Japan).If you are in the area you should definitely stop in here for some ramen and an Asahi.
Sara G.}Brooklyn, NY}11}125}37}-1}3}3/3/2011}Yummy basic, hearty noodles. Fast service, but don't bother asking questions...
Amy C.}Houston, TX}7}60}56}-1}4}3/1/2011}I visited NYC twice: in 2005 and 2011. I was walking in the East Village and was looking one restaurant recommend by traveler book; a wrong turn, I found Rai Rai Ken by accident. I visited this place twice in 2005 5-day trip. The first night in NYC this time, I couldn't wait to visit this place again. Shoyu Ramen is my favor. I arrived 30 minutes before it opens and the restaurant fill up just 10 minutes after it opened. WOW.  However, the Giyoza didn't tasted good and looked smaller than 6 years ago.  I only had one and wasted the rest; sorry to Rai Rai Ken chef.
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}2/27/2011Updatedreview}This is still one of my favorite ramen shops in the EV. I usually get the curry ramen and the seafood fried rice, which tastes awesome because they use butter. I mix the two things a little and take the rest of the rice home. Perfect place for a meal for one.
Lisa S.}New York, NY}2}19}0}-1}4}2/15/2011}Another East Village favorite! Casual atmosphere, good food, and open late.
Wing L.}Long Island, NY}204}245}78}-1}3}2/13/2011}the space is cramped but you know what, that's one of the cool features of this place.  Stepping in reminds me of the many ramen shops in Tokyo.  The set-up/ decor is the same.But then, it ends there.  The ramen is nothing to write home about. It was good but not "OMG this is so good! I must tweet about my amazing experience right now!"  I'm a big fan of good broth for ramen. I don't drink it but it should be rich enough for the noodles to soak in. The broth tasted more like water and was served luke warm.  It was A-OK, and i will leave it at that.
Lawrence C.}New York, NY}328}290}5}-1}4}2/12/2011}I only had the pork fried rice.  It's one of the best fried rices I've had.  There probably could have been a bit more flavor from the pork, but other than that...great dish with a stickier rice consistency.
Dan F.}Brooklyn, NY}1}15}0}-1}4}2/8/2011}Nice ramen at reasonable prices. When I was there they were playing great Brazilian music and you couldn't help but dance. Highly recommended!
Ginny L.}New York, NY}51}371}35}-1}3}2/4/2011}I've been wanting to try out Rai Rai Ken since i dunno when....so my gf and i decided to drop by for late lunch.When i first walked in...i thought i was in Japan...the whole decor and the atmosphere was just like the ramen places in Japan! I was pleased...however, the food was ok. I had the Shyo-yu Ramen and my gf had the Miso Ramen and Gyoza. I was surprised that they didnt have tonkotsu ramen...how can a ramen place not have tonkotsu(Pork Bone) ramen...weird!Anywho...the Shyo-yu Ramen was pretty simple...i do taste the dashi..but the soup base was still rather weak, like they didnt spend alot of time making the soup...the menma(bamboo shoot) was really sweet....and doesnt taste like the usual yummy menma that i had at other Ramen places...other than that, the buta (Cha-siu) was tender!! My gf's miso ramen tasted like dan dan men, lol. The gyoza she ordered were good but they were so small....overall we were both not impressed with the food...=/Note: They have a stamp card...if you accumulated 10 stamps(1stamp per bowl of noodles)..then you'll get a free bowl of ramen....=PNote #2 : Cash Only...so come prepared!
Andrew S.}New York, NY}3}11}0}-1}4}2/3/2011}Nice little hidden NYC spot. Ramen was very good as were the shrimp/shiitake dumplings. Great value for the money, wish they had udon. Comparable to Momofuku or Ippudo. Great & fast service with a nice vantage point to see the action inside the kitchen and the roar of the high BTU burners.
Greta K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}17}0}-1}4}2/3/2011}Damn good ramen!!  I was impressed with how well balanced the broth is and the chashu is soooo tender!  Only question is - - where are the koreans??
Vivian Y.}Brooklyn, NY}42}124}125}18}4}1/31/2011}It's a comfy little ramen shop that gives you a feel of tokyo's ramen shops. It may only seat no more than 15 but it definitely feels cozy sitting @ a bar like table in front of the chef as he's preparing the food.My boyfriend order the mabo don and the chef cooked it right there and then. His rice and soup came steamy hot. I ordered the shoyu ramen and I've got to say, it isn't the best ramen I have had and it is nothing like anything I have had. The noodles are very chewy and the broth is clear.Oh and behind their business card, you could get stamps. Collect 10 stamps (1 for each bowl of ramen) and then get 1 free. How awesome!
Cathy M.}Yonkers, NY}26}30}10}-1}4}1/28/2011}awesome noodles.. cooked perfectly, had the right amount of chew..not mushy at all. had the mapo tofu ramen.. HUH? oh yes.. the best of silky spicy tofu and ground pork just delicious comfortable stomach warming broth that fills you up...its well worth the wait if the tiny shop is filled...
Jim U.}Washington, DC}669}1303}3042}-1}2}1/27/2011}Michelin recommended ramen is bad ramen indeed.  It's not even close.  The shoyu ramen ($8.50) is a bit dreadful.  They definitely serve up the saltiest broth I have encountered.  Their offering of pork is a mere slice which is thick and chewy, not quite the texture I was seeking.  Beyond that there were a few bamboo shoots, a small fish cake, and half an egg.  Dispensing with that piece of pork at the beginning, I was left with a nearly vegetarian lunch set.  It was mostly broth, and it mostly tasted like soy.  Blech.  The restaurant itself is kind of interesting.  It's about the size of a trailer, and it's split down the middle.  On one side there is an impossibly tight kitchen, and on the other an equally tight area to sit and eat.  Sitting on my stool and eating from the counter, I was nudged a few times by people taking their seats, leaving, etc.  There is nothing comfortable about the setup at all.  Worse, the seats are pretty close together, so be wary of hands reaching into your limited private space and grabbing for chopsticks or napkins.    The only saving grace is the very low prices.   Nonetheless, I say avoid.
Amrish A.}Sunnyvale, CA}133}19}0}-1}4}1/22/2011}Great ramen, as already pointed out by everyone else. We got the curry ramen with corn, which made it sweet. The fried rice was quite good too, though it could have been a little more spiced up.
Lana K.}Rego Park, NY}44}237}0}-1}2}1/22/2011}Rai Rai you failed me. I actually liked the super small cozy straight out of Asia noodle bar feel, but not the ramen at all!!! what's up with all that cr*p in the miso one?
WHATS g.}Huntington Beach, CA}4}37}0}-1}5}1/22/2011}my staple ramen spot....all other ramen spots i visit are compare to this one.mapo tofu ramen in wnter...and the miso in summer...forget it...epic.5 beers,edemame,ramen,maybe some gyoza...done deal.
John H.}New York, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}1/20/2011}I have been there a handful of times and everytime it has been good.  If you are a frequent customer you start to get the ramen for free if you eat enough of them.  As others have said the place is small, the bathroom is a disaster.  But the food is really good.  I enjoy the soy ramen and their fried rice and dumplings are really good as well.  I would say the fried rice is their best dish.I am tall so sitting here is a challenge.  If you are coming with friends be prepared to wait a bit to get stools next to each other.  If you like something specific, just ask for more of it.  Sometimes they charge you and sometimes they don't.It used to be better when they were opened later, but what can you do.
Thinh N.}New York, NY}145}44}4}-1}4}1/19/2011}the opposite of ippudo.Ippudo: deliciously thick and filling broth, spacious, loud waiters and kinda pricey. One comes out of ippudo feeling stuffed and sorta done for the day - foodwiseRaiRai: pleasantly clear and fresh broth, tiny but cosy, table right next to kitchen and reasonably priced. One comes out RaiRai Ken feeling satisfied and ready for dessert.  highly recommended --- especially if you want to try ramen that is completely different from what is served at ippudo.
maz z.}Middle Village, NY}0}12}0}-1}3}1/19/2011}3.5  though I would love to give a 4...Reason for 3.5 instead, although the ramen was very delicious and I really liked it and enjoyed it.....as my friend, who also had ramen, pointed out and I also realized, the noodles weren't ramen noodles...they were lo mein.  Don't get me wrong, I would come back here someday because it was still very delicious, but I wanted ramen noodles, not lo mein.  My friend also agrees.Rai Rai Ken is small (a bit cool during the summer with the AC), and service was awesome.  It was three of us, while two more of my friends decided they wanted curry next door.  When they finished and came in to see how we were doing, the chef gave them glasses of water even though he knew they weren't going to order.  Very nice.
Tricia R.}Ballwin, MO}36}231}0}-1}3}1/11/2011}Tiny ramen place that was recommended by a friend - my sister and I came in late on Wednesday after happy hour and ordered the shoyu ramen.  It wasn't bad, but maybe it had been overhyped for me.  At the same time, maybe due to the late hr, the food wasn't as good as it is normally?  The pork was a bit on the tough/chewy side, but the broth and the noodles were pretty good.  The egg was also slightly overcooked, but believe me when I say the bowl was still empty.  Prices are on par with other places, but I don't know if we'll come back late night again.
Maria F.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}5}1/10/2011}This place is a jem!!!! Real New York hole in the wall...teh food is out of this world...their ramens are on a light side, and soooooooo delicious & full of flavour. I alse think it's the best gyoza in NYC. It's a religion... fan since 2006:)
Jacqui M.}Brooklyn, NY}81}192}0}-1}4}1/6/2011}This place is tiny and can only seat maybe 12-15 people at a time. While I hate waiting around, I like that Rai Rai Ken is small. It's closer to a traditional ramen bar than some of the bigger places.They specialize in Tokyo style ramen, or shoyu, but they offer miso, curry and shio in addition to some changing specials. The gyoza and shumai are good. I really like the curry ramen - it's different than the typical bowl of ramen I'm used to with a nice kick to it.
I. C.}Saratoga, CA}2}94}0}-1}4}1/3/2011}LOVE this place.  It is a tiny little place with about 12-15 seats in the entire place.  I'd recommend going just before the busy times -- especially if it's cold outside because there is little room to wait inside.The ramen is fairly priced, and the ambience is not pretentious and very comfortable.
Rose D.}Staten Island, NY}4}11}0}-1}5}12/29/2010}This has been my favorite place for ramen for the past 11 years!!! SO GOOD!!! They have a small menu and only a few seats but fast service and amazing food!!!! LOVE!
Theodore W.}Somerville, MA}0}31}1}-1}5}12/29/2010}This review is for the curry ramen only. Curry ramen + extra sweet corn  = one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had. Simple as that. Hadn't been there in years, but just went back and still as good as it ever was. F Ippudo! This is my fav Ramen place in NYC.
Mr F G And Ms M S.}Flushing, NY}668}1041}4009}-1}4}12/29/2010}Another great hole in the wall, capacity only around 15 people, no waiting when we got thereGreat ramen, there is a late lunch special between 2-5 PM , for only $11 you can have a bowl of ramen and one choice of side dish (gyoza, chahan rice)
Meredith G.}Brooklyn, NY}0}11}0}-1}5}12/28/2010}My favorite ramen place, hands down. Their miso ramen with pork is fantastic! The crispy garlic invades my dreams when I'm away from New York for too long. So completely worth huddling up with friends in that tiny space. Just bring good friends.
Tyler L.}New York, NY}342}854}1161}18}3}12/28/2010}This place is like a typical ramen bar that you would see in Japan. It is long and very narrow, with stools lining the bar, so it can feel cramped in there. Behind the bar, you can see the cooks preparing the food.I came here for the curry ramen. It was not bad. The noodles were chewy and tasted good, and the broth they used was okay as well (but not as flavorful as other ramens I've had). The pork though was a little tough and seemed overcooked. It should have been more tender.Their prices are standard for ramen, like $9-$10 for a bowl. This is an okay place for ramen - emphasis on the word okay.
Evan G.}Williston, VT}2}23}0}-1}4}12/23/2010}It's a great hole in the wall and perfect on a cold day.  I always opt for the miso ramen.  It has amazing depth of flavor, much more than the shio or shoyu.  Miso ramen plus the gyoza is a must.
James L.}Brooklyn, NY}29}7}0}-1}4}12/21/2010}Some of the best ramen in the neighborhood for the price. Always a good choice!Be sure to add corn to the ramen, and do not be afraid to try the fried rice, its realllly good.
Hannah C.}Fort Lee, NJ}648}480}56}-1}2}12/5/2010}whenever i eat ramen at a restaurant, i always end up telling myself to make a mental note to never eat ramen that i didn't cook myself. it's like poor man's food that you can make in less than 5 minutes at home...with that said, this place tries really hard to be authentic, and i get it -- the teeny tiny hole in the wall, bar-style seating...but two latinos dressed up in japanese outfits preparing my food? come on. overall, the ramen wasn't bad, but i wasn't impressed by it either. if you grew up eating ramen noodles as much as i did, then you'll understand what i'm talking about.
Pat R.}Manhattan, NY}32}420}0}-1}3}11/21/2010}An oldie but goodie...one of the good ramen places before the ramen invasion over last 2 yrs.  Ramen is good but place is tiny...feels like mom & pop ramen places in tokyo.  Be sure to order the sliced pork--that is a standout.
Scott W.}Manhattan, NY}20}3}9}-1}4}11/16/2010}When I'm in need of noodles during the cold months and feeling under the weather...Rai Rai Ken has never failed me.  Its a small place so I sometimes order to go when its crowded since I live down the block but I recommend sitting down and enjoying the ambience.  I've never been to Japan, but I would think this is a very traditional setting for a noodle shop.  The Shoyu ramen and the curry ramen are my go-tos for the noodles and I must point out that their fried rice is very tasty.
Becky G.}East Bay, CA}5}90}0}-1}3}11/13/2010}Certainly cozy, even for NYC.  Think Tokyo.  Great bowl of ramen for a chilly NYC evening.  Best for eating with 1-2 friends.
Darren R.}New York, NY}6}127}49}-1}5}11/11/2010}Everyone at Rising Dragon Tattoos love this place for take out, the Ramen's great, the food is consistently delicious and so far they deliver pretty quickly.
Andrea L.}FLUSHING, NY}77}476}159}-1}4}11/10/2010}The aroma of sweet holy bowls of ramen will make you salivate the moment you step into this hole in the wall.  You'd have to be skinnier than a noodle strand to squeeze down the row of stools, but once seated, it takes only a moment after ordering for those piping hot bowls of goodness to arrive.  Your anticipation soars, you waste no time unwrapping chopsticks, and grab the spoon to get some shio broth in your mouth.  Slurp slurp.  It's good, but the more you eat, the more you realize that it's kind of overly salty  :(  And is it really seafood just because you have a single slice of fishcake in the bowl?  The noodles are good, but maybe you would have been better off with the shoyu ramen.  But truth be told, it's a wintery November day and you're grateful to have a brothy hot treat from Rai Rai Ken to fill your belly, even if it's not perfect.  (3.5 stars)
Anh P.}Sunnyvale, CA}573}329}587}-1}3}11/6/2010}Cute hole in the wall with a few seats. Makes you feel like you're in an authentic mini Japanese ramen bar (or at least thats how I picture it in my mind). The Shio Ramen with butter and corn was not the best I've had, a little too salty for my taste. But the Mabo Tofu was good, I got a few spoonful of brother from the bf. Good texture, nice and spicy, thick with ground pork. They also have a stamp card, 10 bowls get one free.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}1}10/29/2010}I am with george t. Feel like Japan but food taste like not Japan. I had Syou Ramen. Boiled egg was over cooked. Soup had only one not of flavor Soy sauce. Umami from the kelp and bonito was not coming through. Noodle was okay. I like their noodle than Ippudo but I rather pay more for satisfying feeling that Ippudo gives.... depth and layer of taste and flavor....yum!I also ordered most Japanese order with Ramen. It's Gyoza. It was too garlicky and mushy inside but the bottom of Gyoza was cooked crispy and executed well. The sauce on the side was too salty! I like salt and I lacked salty in my system so I needed a lot of salt intake a day but it was way too salty to enjoy Gyoza.My dinner: $16 included tip & tax
george t.}Long Island City, NY}8}171}0}-1}3}10/25/2010}a no-nonsense place with no-nonsense attitude and no-nonsense food.came in, got a bowl of ramen, gyoza, ate, paid, got out in less than 20min. Pretty amazing turnover rate. A little dissapointed that the soup base for ramen is soy based, so its not creamy but clear brooth. The taste was OK, nothing special. Not worth making a trip to but a decent place for a quick bite if you live around the area.
Steve C.}Bellerose, NY}85}166}51}-1}3}10/22/2010}More memorable for the atmosphere than the Ramen, which was lacking in flavor and richness. Stepping in here you know you're in a Ramen shop. Small and dingy. Bar sitting only. I really love the feel of the place so I would come back to try something else.
gwen L.}New York, NY}3}135}0}-1}2}10/15/2010}I trekked all the way down to East Village after having a sudden craving for Japanese ramen (not of the instant kind).  Rai Rai Ken was the first ramen place that popped up on Yelp.  Actually, Matsukado was the first result, but after realizing it's no longer open, I yelped again and came up w Rai Raik Ken.I got the shio ramen.  It was OK.  I've certainly had better ramen in Japan.  I haven't had any here in NYC to compare (not the biggest ramen fan, I'm afraid) but the soup base could have been better.  It didn't have the depth traditional shio broth usually have.  I'm used to a richer, heavier (translation fatty) shio broth.  The noodles were ok.  I could tell they were the refrigerated kind that's bought in Asian stores.I don't think the ramen was worth the $8.50+ tax+tip and the trek down to East Village.  If I ever get another craving, I'll try some other ramen shop.
chris b.}New York, NY}2}14}4}-1}5}10/12/2010}I asked my friends, who are really into ramen, where there was a good place to get some around union square. Simultaneously all of them said, "Rai Rai Ken."  If four people, together, recommend something you have to check it out. I have to say, after eating there, the food was fantastic. I got the curry ramen and it was so good. I am defiantly going back. If I had to make one criticism I would say that the place is on the small side. It can be cramped if you are carrying things or are on the heavy side.That being said the food is well worth it. Go, spend money and keep this place open because the next time I go down to the city I want more ramen!
Food Lover W.}Jamesburg, NJ}70}64}28}-1}4}10/9/2010}I am going to give 4 stars for now.  This is my first true ramen experience, and we did enjoy it, but we are planning on trying different places in the future, so maybe my thoughts will change once I have more experience under my belt.We decided to take my son here for dinner, because we wanted to walk around the village, and he has always wanted to try true Ramen (not from a package).  After reading many reviews on Yelp and checking out the neighborhoods we were going to be in, I settled on Rai Rai Ken.  First impression, the place is TINY (but I guess they all are?), the bathroom is the most completely bizzare wacky bathroom I have ever been in and again, TINY!  Don't plan on primping yourself in there, you are lucky if you can pee and wash your hands.  We sat down at stools at the bar (a little cramped), and the chefs were right over the wall.  I had tried to famiiarize myself with some of the terminology before having dinner there so the menu wouldn't be completely foreign, so we managed to order ourselves our meals.  I wouldn't say the staff is unfriendly, more unobstrusive and reserved, maybe a language barrier thing or a cultural thing?  My husband went for the Shio Ramen with the fish cake, not knowing what it was supposed to taste like, he enjoyed it but said the fish cake was very mild - maybe it's supposed to be.  I ordered a bowl of the Curry Ramen - only once slice of pork, but over all, I really enjoyed the flavor.  I wound up having to order my son a bowl of ramen that did not seem to appear on the menu, but maybe its something they offer that you just ask for - he wanted chicken, and ramen - so they gave him a bowl of miso broth with chicken and ramen.  Let me tell you, that miso broth was unbelievable, I have never tasted anything like it, next time I go I am getting it.  My husband and I also shared an order of gyoza, which tasted extremely fresh, but they were very delicate and fell apart very easily; and we shared a half order of the fried rice - killer dish, addictive.  It also appears as if they only serve canned sodas, but I could be wrong.  BTW, this is a very inexpensive way to have a very filing and satisfying meal.Overall, we enjoyed the meal not having any prior knowledge of what to expect.  Our next ramen shop to try is Ramen Setagaya on St. Marks.
Sergio L Y.}Los Angeles, CA}60}129}28}-1}3}10/6/2010}Back in 2005, my New York friend brought me here for ramen. We walk all the way from  West Village to Rai Rai Ken. It was a very good exercise before our hot bowls of ramen. Ever since then, I would come here when I visit NYC. It's definitely not the best ramen out there, but it's not bad. It's good for late night casual dinner.
William R.}San Francisco, CA}157}124}2}-1}2}10/4/2010}9.17.20102:00PM...a bloody disappointment.  I have approximately 8 total meals while here in NYC and I wish I could take this one back...Shiu mai tasted like is was thawed, then steamed.The cooks forgot to add chicken in my miso ramen when they served it to me so they gave me a handful of poached chicken on the side...which was cold....and didn't really go with my ramen...The shio ramen my friend had was actually quite nice....but again, the bowl of ramen in front of ME wasn't...so regrettably, I continue my search...
Seamus K.}Richmond Hill, NY}2}9}14}-1}5}10/3/2010}Rai Rai Ken is a great little Japanese ramen spot.  It's very small, cozy and relatively inexpensive.  Sitting there eating my ramen for the first time I felt like I was in a neighborhood noodle shop in the middle of Japan.For years I have been going to Menchanko-Tei on 55th street to get my ramen noodles.  I still Love Menchanko-Tei but Rai Rai Ken is a great alternative. Loved the food, loved the experience and I'm glad my friend introduced me to Rai Rai Ken.  And I look forward to be gong there a lot more in the future.I also really enjoyed the gyoza and the buckwheat beer.
Tiffany D.}Arlington, TX}1786}870}756}18}3}9/30/2010}I had the Shoyu ramen with Paul H. here the other night. The bowl looked pretty amazing. it was soo pretty with its richly colored broth and yellow noodles but it didn't taste as good as it looked. Maybe I was still full so my tongue was a little bit more discriminating but I believe there's a yummier bowl out there somewhere else.
Eugene T.}Paramus, NJ}1}30}0}-1}3}9/30/2010}Gotta love ramen. it's quick, sort of inexpensive, and it'll fill you up. This place is not so different than other ramen places, but they say they don't use MSG so that's a plus. I got the seafood ramen, and expected some bits of seafood in it, but it was just the flavor of the broth that was 'seafood'. Grrrrr. And why is ramen so salty? It doesn't have to be that salty! Nice little place, chefs serve you. Cash only! Not bad if you're in the area.P.S. Get the Buckwheat Ale.

Coty S.}Saint Petersburg, FL}1931}1471}3797}18}2}9/21/2010}My cousin said that this establishment came highly recommended.  The shop is cute, like a ramen shop you would actually see in Japan, with just a bar of stools and that's it.  There are some condiments to use, one being a caddy with clear and red vinegar.  It just so happened that our caddy of vinegar had a dead big floating in it.  So I switched it for another, just so I did not have to continue looking at it.  There is nowhere to put your stuff here, no hanger hooks under the bar like most places.  You are greeted and served by only one person, even though there are two cooks running around in front of you.  The Gyoza were fresh and made in house, I watched them being made.  However, the filling was the worst, it just tasted like finely minced cabbage and green onion.  Cabbage dumplings are not appealing at all.  Let's move on.I ordered the "Golden Curry" Ramen, which tasted like it was straight from the box.  The noodles were the only decent item in the bowl; they were thin, eggy, and chewy.  Just the way I like them.  But, I became tired of the broth after three bites and wanted to move onto something else.  The egg was not seasoned, just a hard boiled egg.  I think that Minca seriously spoiled me at this point.  The pork was absolutely terrible!  It was pale, like it was boiled, and super tough with no flavor.  My husband had the Shio Ramen, which was much better than the Curry Ramen that my cousin and I had.  The Shio broth was a tad oily, but the flavor was decent.  The prices are considerably higher than what the menu posted in the photos lead you to believe.  3 bowls of mediocre ramen, order of gyoza, and a diet coke was $35.  I do not think that I will come here again to try the other items, there are much better ramen places within walking distance.   I hate to give them two stars, because they are more 2.5 stars.  But, I have been being way too generous lately with places that I would never return to.
Eric C.}Warren, NJ}8}36}5}-1}1}9/19/2010}Shoyu(soy) ramen taste mentsuyu(soup for soba) n miso ramen taste only garlic. This isn't ramen. Mazui!!(tast bad! In jp)
Athena C.}San Francisco, CA}925}1562}681}18}4}9/15/2010Updatedreview}Just tried their Mabo Ramen today  and was really happy with it! They gave you a lot of tofu and ground pork. The soup is spicy, savory and the noodles is chewy but not too hard.It also only costs $8.5. I am coming back here soon for the winter!
Michelle Y.}Los Angeles, CA}158}312}11}18}2}9/14/2010}I first came here a long time ago with my sister. We were both still pretty amateur when it came to having super ramen but agreed that it was just okay. Not great but not bad either. I just went again this past week as a much more seasoned ramen consumer, and the ramen was so disappointing! I really want to love the place cause the space is really small and cool and I love the counter- it feels like I'm in a Japanese noir film. But the ramen was sooooooo not impressive. Everything in my bowl of Shio Ramen was pretty bland... the soup did not have the full body flavor of my other ramen spots. The noodles were bland, the fishcake was bland, the bamboo was bland, the egg was dry, and the pork was on the tough side. Wah wah wah. My bf's curry ramen was equally disappointing. I guess I'll leave this spot to the newbies.
Milan M.}Brooklyn, NY}7}22}0}-1}2}9/7/2010}I am giving this place two stars only for the atmosphere. I liked the flags everywhere, and the natural looking wood bar. That part remind me of Japan.I would only give it one star for the Ramen that I had. The broth was thin, boring, and tasted like chicken bouillon. The pork was too chewy. It just couldn't cure my ramen craving. But that is okay, because there are many other ramen options in this neighborhood.
Daisy M.}New York, NY}0}293}73}-1}2}9/7/2010}IF you are into hearty meaty thick broth, this broth won't do much for you. It certainly did not do for me.It was very plain and unimpressive ramen.
Christine Y.}New York, NY}36}132}8}-1}5}8/15/2010Updatedreview}Tried the curry ramen recently. Not as nearly heavenly as the Shio ramen. The curry masks a lot of the other flavors that I would like to taste. However, I still love this place. Just know that Shio  ramen is the way to go!
Karen K.}Bayside, NY}31}51}0}-1}5}8/12/2010}i absolutely LOVE this place!  it has about 10 seats, small place, but def. worth it!the gyoza is superb.. as well as the fried rice and the miso ramen. my hubby and i have been to a lot of ramen places in the city, even the more expensive ones.. but still revert back to this tiny place.. which is super authentic..
Ahris K.}New York, NY}15}25}66}-1}5}8/5/2010}Loved it here!Imagine yourself walking in the East Village rain, chilly and hungry...then you find this little joint, so tiny you can almost pass it by. Sit down on one of what it seemed lik 10 chairs at most...Enjoy yourself some crispy gyoza before slurping away the chewy goodness that is Japanese ramen in your choice of broth.Yea, it was pretty cinematic. Cinematically delicious. mmmI don't know how busy it gets on the weekends, but weekday late lunch/early dinner time seemed pretty good.
Starry S.}New York, NY}12}275}543}-1}3}8/3/2010}I came here only because the overrated Ippudo was crowded to the max. I wasn't going to wait 30 min for seats on a late Monday night. Don't these people have work the next day?!?! lolRai Rai Ken is open and empty! I ordered the Hiyashi Chuka (No Broth-Ramen noodle with cucumber, ginger, chicken, sun-dried tomatoes slices). Okay, I saw something of a mustard sort paste. I mixed it in all together! Boy was I wrong. It was crazy wasabi mustard, disguised in yellow coloring. Totally ruined my noodle dish!! I was breathing fire through my nose and tearing. Why couldn't they gave me a hint of some sort somewhere on the menu...wall...chair...in japanese....My friends ordered the other Ramens (shoyu, shio). They mentioned that it was bit salty to the taste. Get ready to be thirsty after your meal...zoommm
Alice C.}San Francisco, CA}218}453}91}-1}4}8/1/2010Updatedreview}I tried the mabo tofu ramen last night and it is DELICIOUS. Pretty much just mabo tofu heaped on top of a bowl of ramen noodles and broth, but seriously good stuff especially at just $8.50 a bowl. Pretty spicy though, so not for those who can't take it!Still one of my top ramen spots in the city, even if I rarely make it out there anymore. It's good, but a bit cheaper compared to other ramen places. Good-sized portions, and food is served quickly (though finding a seat may be a problem in this hole-in-the-wall type joint). Coming at a later hour (I'd say after 9:30pm) will pretty much guarantee you a spot right away though.**CASH ONLY**
Noly S.}San Jose, CA}43}86}0}-1}3}7/28/2010}Ordered the shoyu ramen with a side of the shrimp fried rice. Ramen was nothing to cry home about. I've had better ramen in my time. 8.50 for a bowl is moderate, but a lil pushing it for the one piece of roast pork your getting with your soup. The fried rice on the other hand was in a rank of it's own. lol  I think I'm about to say ..."it's the best fried rice I've had in a loooong time." There I said it. :)
Cat L.}New York, NY}287}145}122}-1}5}7/28/2010}Just looking through the pictures from the users will surely make you drool, and that's what Rai Rai Ken can do to you!EXTREMELY delicious, go early on weekdays and you won't have a wait! I think this place is comparable to Ippudo, delicious and cheap ramen! I had the Shoyu Ramen with pork and a side of Gyoza. It's only $9 dollars and doesn't get better than that!Seating areas are extremely small, good for a "hit and run" meal
Eva G.}New York, NY}144}688}465}-1}4}7/19/2010}This is a tiny shop that seats possibly 12 people, bar-style only. We waited 5 minutes for seats, and the food took 5 minutes to come after we ordered. The shoyu ramen ($8.50) tastes good, but nothing of the exceptional. The noodles are bouncy but not like fresh in-house ramen (but not flat like instant ramen either). The broth not fatty, but maybe on the salty side. It all depends on your personal style. After eating more ramen, I come to realize that I like the noodles at Minca better (they don't taste like they come from a box).On the negative, it's a challenge eating here in the summer, because you'd be lucky if you felt a draft of cool AC every now and then. Cash only.
Jenny C.}New York, NY}83}586}516}18}3}7/16/2010}I wouldn't say that Rai Rai Ken is at the top of my list of local ramen joints. I tried their Miso Ramen since anywhere I go I have to try. I really didn't like it here. First off, its $9 for a bowl of Miso Ramen and I don't even get the normal toppings like pork, egg, or corn?!? Boo! What's this? A dollar extra if I want corn? Ugh. Get outta here! I should have tried the Shoyu or Shio Ramens first. The only saving grace was the fried rice. BF was right, they do make it pretty good here.
Kristy L.}Alameda, CA}112}109}5}-1}4}7/13/2010}Any of my friends can vouch that I do HEART my ramen! Rai Rai Ken was my go-to staple ramen joint - an order of Cha Shiu, half fried rice with shrimp and scallops and a bowl of Shoyu Ramen always hits the spot! (shared with the boy of course, I'm not that beastly!)  I wish I reviewed this before I ate at Ippudo, but unfortunately, I've had the pleasure of tasting a bowl of $15 goodness. Rai Rai is still on the top of my list, though - and definitely worth future visits. --K
Al F.}New York, NY}18}3}1}-1}4}7/4/2010}Late night noodles are the best!  I had gyoza and the shoyu ramen -- there's nothing better than good ramen.  I will return!
Betty M.}New York, NY}55}208}1}-1}1}6/21/2010}I have to say, and agree with the other rater that there are a lot better ramen places to be had. I can't say it's extremely bad, but I felt like I rather have had a pack of $.35 cent ramen at home. At least it would have a better taste. We had the Shoyu and the Shio Ramen. The Shio ramen was very bland. I normally don't put any condiments into my food ever, because I believe that a good chef should have a good consistency for all his customers, but this time I had to. The noodles itself was very tough and rubbery, almost as though it hasn't been cooked throughly. Yes I understand that it should have a little of a bouncy feeling in your mouth, but this one, once you've actually gone and chewed it down, you can almost taste the raw flour that it was made with. The Shoyu flavor, was flavored, but immensely by soy sauce. For some, it might float their boat, since I've seen people put soy sauce on their rice and enjoy it just like that.Lastly, I'm 100% sure the one Asian guy that works there is Chinese. From the Chinese scrolls on the wall by the bathroom, to the Mah Po Tofu and Cha Sui on the menu. Because of that, it might actually add a little bias to my review, considering I don't know why a Chinese guy would want to venture into serving Japanese Ramen. We (I'm Chinese) have our own styles in cooking our noodles, whether dry or soupy, and as for him trying to incorporate the Ma Poh Tofu, into Japanese Ramen, is quite strange... but different. In addition, I don't believe Cha-Sui is a Japanese thing. My final thought is that, if he didn't try to pawn this off as a Japanese Ramen joint, I would have been a little more susceptible to give a better review - I would have probably ordered the more "fusion" plates instead, but alas it is a noodle shop, and I am rating on the 2 of the 4 main flavors of Japanese Ramen.
Vivian K.}Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY}60}103}0}-1}5}6/7/2010}I LUB YOU RAI RAI KEN!!!!! where else do i have a short wait, easy and cheap menu and a consistently tasty ramen bowl full of loving noodles??? where else do i want to drink the entire bowl of soup when i'm done - and when i mean drink i mean lift the bowl to my mouth and just pour down my throat??where else is there awesome cha-sui or gyoza or fried rice as appetizers that are under 5-6 bucks?? where else can i go when ippudo has a god awful wait of 2.5 hours, and i just NEED noodles???and where else can you go to make yourself feel content after a night of binging?? RAI RAI KEN. that's where .. bitches.
Rob S.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}6/5/2010}Just plain rules. fat, full and happy everytime
Jason J.}Chicago, IL}16}104}1}-1}4}5/22/2010}Rai Rai Ken is cool. It lacks the flash of places like Ippudo or Momo, but that can be a good thing. From an absolute standpoint, it isn't the best ramen in the city, but you don't usually have to wait in line and you don't have to pay $15. So, among the lower-end ramen places, I'd put it above places like Setagaya or Menkui Tei. Oh, and service is fast and responsive.
L B.}Los Angeles, CA}39}98}6}-1}4}5/21/2010}After walking 10 blocks in the freezing rain wearing skimpy Halloween costumes our crew passed Rai Rai Ken. The best idea of the night was to step inside and warm up with a hot bowl of soup. Extra bonus- they have a frequent diner card for a free bowl of soup after 8 visits- gotta love it!
Stephen S.}Brooklyn, NY}8}127}33}-1}4}5/19/2010}Okay - $8.50 for a big piping bowl of really delicious ramen - a bit cramped, but who cares - we sat right down (I've only been to Ippudo for ramen before so both the price and the availability were supreme delights, the broth was not as good as Ippudo - but the pork was better - noodles on par) - I will be eating here often.
Jenny K.}San Diego, CA}16}67}1}-1}5}5/8/2010}amazing is a pretty drastic understatement for describing rai rai ken. it is especially inadequate for describing how f-ing awesome the miso ramen (with a hard-boiled egg instead of chicken) is: it is a soy-based broth with beansprouts, cabbage, onion, scallion, and toasted garlic. incredible.i went there every tuesday night for three years. and i left new york a year ago and still think about it at least three times a week. no joke.
Sam T.}New York, NY}65}18}0}-1}4}5/4/2010}First I should say the service here is beyond speedy. Yesterday I stopped over for lunch by myself and ordered the shio ramen (house special seafood broth). It was in front of me in less than two minutes. This was the second time I'd been here. The first I got the miso ramen, which was delicious, though it got a bit salty about halfway through. Both visits the noodles were perfectly springy and slippery; each slurp easily pulling the noodles right into my mouth until my cheeks were bulging.The seafood broth was the opposite in flavor as the miso. I found myself adding a lot of seasoning as the flavor was quite subtle. I wouldn't say bland, however, because it did have a nice flavor which was mostly noticeable in the noodles.The space is small. It is a bar around the kitchen. The first time I went, I had to wait about 15 minutes for a few people to leave before my friends and I could sit. The efficient service practically makes its small capacity for seating a non-issue though.
Nathalie D.}New York, NY}285}59}24}-1}4}4/30/2010}Peeeerrrrfect place for an authentic, quick meal. Please note, this is not Ipudo (my favorite ramen place when they have shio). Rai Rai Ken is a small, I believe typical, ramen place. Whoever said the service is horrible is completely wrong. You just have to know how to work the ramen house. I walked in, sat down and looked around for the cook. He came right up and I ordered the Shio ramen. Within a good 5 minutes it was steaming hot in front of me. I am no ramen expert, but I am pretty picky. This held up to a higher standard than Setagaya. It has been a year since I have been to Setagaya but Rai Rai Ken beats it. The broth was perfectly salted, the noodles were excellent. Not mushy, not too thick, and not too thin. For $8 this is great deal. I left completely satisfied and will come here again. Oh and they are open late!
Marina G.}Rego Park, NY}42}154}0}-1}1}4/21/2010}Worst ramen I've had to date. The place itself is cute and aims to be a Tokyo style ramen bar. Service is good too. 3 of us came in late on a  Saturday night and were promptly and attentively served. We ordered the Shoyu ramen...which is  a favorite of mine. what can I say the charshu was dry, the broth had no flavor and the egg which is my favorite part was fully hard boiled and had no seasoning. The noodles had a nice bite but didn't compensate for the rest of the components. Mushrooms were great though. The price is right at around 8 bucks but I rather pay more and get a better bowl.
caitlin o.}Clinton Hill, NY}7}218}1}-1}2}4/16/2010}Wah.They put mung beans in their ramen. Many, many mung beans. I can't stand them so I tried to eat around them, but the bitterness permeated and destroyed the delicate flavor of their broth...That aside, the gyoza were greasy.There's better elsewhere.
Zed A.}Brooklyn, NY}4}41}0}-1}1}4/14/2010}Pretty mediocre imitation of a Tokyo ramen joint.  Salient differences include:1. people sit at the counter FOREVER, like it's a coffee shop;2. the staff doesn't acknowledge you;3. the ramen is barely better than the kind we all ate in college.This place is a paradigmatic instance of Manhattan cuisine: halfassed atmosphere and halfass food.  There are much better ramen places within a couple of blocks of here (e.g., Ippudo, Minca, Setagaya, etc.).
Subir G.}New York, NY}9}64}0}-1}5}3/30/2010}Oldie but goodie.  Really good ramen, and the tiny store with its genuinely quirky custom decor has to win the vibe contest amongst noodle shops in the city.
Lili D.}Brooklyn, NY}5}10}0}-1}4}3/12/2010}This place is definitely in my top three favorite Ramen shops in NYC (look up Ippudo and Minca).  They have great shio and miso broth and it's fairly cheap compared to their competitors.  I also give them points for offering two cold ramen dishes in the summer.    The size of the shop is both good and bad: it's intimate and authentically Japanese but often you will have to wait in line.
Christoff F.}New York, NY}12}125}17}-1}4}3/10/2010}I love this place, it is like getting off an airplane and being smack right in the middle of a raman shop in kabuki-cho. Many other people have raved about momo fuku, but as a person who is well versed in ramen in japan this is the sopt for me (sorry david chang, you noodles are chewy gummy and the broth was lacking in flavor).there are a number of other good ramen shops in NYC but perhaps this was one of the first to do it right. the chahan isnt half bad either and as a bonus, they have a frequent eaters card. That's right, the 11th bowl is on them boys and girls.
elise h.}New York, NY}52}235}6}-1}4}3/9/2010}Rai-Rai Ken is a teeny tiny ramen place in the East Village.  It has all your standard dishes, and they don't go overboard with the menu choices -- 2 pages and that's it, which is refreshing in a town where some menus have too many pages to look through.  Unfortunately they don't have any vegetarian-friendly ramens.  But if you want them to serve a ramen with no pork, they will happily do it.  I've sampled a couple things here.  The curry ramen is tasty -- it tastes just like that "Golden Curry" stuff my mom used to use when I was a little kid.  Yes, the skinny box with the gold metallic top!  I've also had a seafood type ramen they offer, which is also very tasty and satisfying.  And I love the fact that they have kimchi on their appetizers list.Basically, this place is cheap and no-nonsense.  The service is great too.  You never have to wait long for your ramen, and everything is provided quickly when you ask for it.  The only thing I wish they could change is the size of the dining area.  It's not very big at all, so on cold nights it might be difficult to get a spot.  But if you go during the "off" hours, or on weeknights, it's fine.
Hideki K.}New York, NY}466}1079}310}-1}2}3/8/2010}I am not a true Tokyo person (Kansai, baby!) even though I have lived there, so I do not have a liking for soy sauce based (shoyu) ramen (or natto for that matter).  Therefore, Rai Rai Ken tastes like garbage to me, but not as garbage as Aji Ichiban.
Allen C.}New York, NY}0}23}0}-1}4}3/6/2010}This 12-seat ramen bar appears to be serve Chinese-Japanese ramen (as far as I can tell), unlike places like Ippudo, Setagaya and Mechanko. The main difference is that Rai Rai's ramen has ingredients (ie vegetables)That being said, Rai Rai Ken must be typical Japanese as at least 1/3 of the customers were Japanese. The price is hard to beat and if there's no wait, the value is infinitely higher than Ippudo. Good place for a light lunch and if you're still hungry after the ramen, head around the corner to Otafuku for some takoyaki to complete the Japanese experience!
Elissa S.}New York, NY}126}279}23}-1}4}3/6/2010}I'm a big fan of this place. The ramen itself is 3-stars (A-OK), but the cool ramen bar feel and low ramen bar price ups it to four stars.In terms of the ramen, Ippudo and Minca are definitely better, but Rai Rai Ken delivers a tasty alternative that's a few bucks cheaper.
Laura B.}Redondo Beach, CA}7}68}0}-1}3}3/3/2010}I enjoyed my shoyu ramen very much.  A great meal on a wintery day.  NOT for groups.  It was awkward for 4.  Also if you have long legs, be prepared for some discomfort.
Cynthia L.}New York, NY}13}29}32}-1}4}3/1/2010}What a neighborhood gem! Authentic and affordable - this place trumps any of the ramen chains in the city!
Daria Janeen M.}Bellmawr, NJ}123}32}32}-1}4}2/19/2010}I usually judge a ramen place by how good their miso ramen is.  The miso ramen here is solid.  I was a bit surprised that the miso ramen was made with chicken instead of the standard pork slices, but I think it worked rather well.  I also tried the new Mabo Tofu Ramen which was also very good.The atmosphere is nothing fancy.  You just order ramen and eat it at the counter.  Just the way a ramen shop should be.
DS W.}Ridgewood, NY}6}4}0}-1}5}2/16/2010}I LOVE this little noodle shop.  It's small, but worth the wait.  Any of the ramen noodles is delicious, my favorite is the miso.  The fried rice and gyoza are great as well.  Don't judge the taste by the price.  Their noodles are 10x better than the trendier looking places, where you are paying for the decor and not the food.  This place is a hidden gem.
B Y.}New York, NY}30}130}0}-1}3}2/16/2010}Stumbled into this little noodle shop on a cold blustery winter day, and was utterly charmed by the tiny, warm interior. Sometimes I don't want my ramen in an ultra-cool restaurant, filled with trendy beautiful people. I want to be able to poke my nose deep into a fragrant bowl, and slurp to my heart's abandon.That being said, many other places in the city have better broth, chewier noodles, more flavorful eggs, more tender pork. My dining companion's bowl, the Shio Ramen, was not impressive at all. The broth was mediocre and on the slightly bland side. It also only came with one thin slice of pork.But I would definitely return to Rai Rai Ken... for the mapo tofu ramen. I love this savory dish on rice, but never had it on noodles before. And it was fantastic. I loved how the thick, spicy sauce transformed the broth into a hearty, meaty meal. My one complaint is that the tofu used was of very low quality, and had very little flavor.A point for unpretentiousness, and two for the unexpected but delicious combo of mapo tofu and noodles.
JulieJuli A.}New York, NY}151}210}52}-1}3}2/8/2010}JulieI really wanted to rate them higher but the ramen is just 3 STAR taste.  The place feels authentic, as if it's something straight out of an alley way from somewhere in japan.  The food really hit the spot as it's cold right now in NYC and the warmth of the soup really relaxed me...  I tried the Shoyu and Shio versions of ramen.  Shoyu is a soy sauce base.  A little too salty...  it's made with pork slices, some veggies and half and egg.  Shio is essentially the same except the soup base was a house seafood version.  I would def go  SHIO...  Remember this place is small. It's not a date place.. and don't linger around.  There's only about 12 seats setup like a food bar around the cooks......  so just finish and move on.  The place is not the cleanest of spots but it feels cozy and the ramen did hit the spot.  The bowl of ramen is not big enough to be completely full....  but good... then you have room to head down the block for some chikalicious desserts or next block for a Veneiro's canolli....
Tunyaluck P.}Troy, NY}117}209}947}18}3}2/6/2010}The soup taste like regular Chinese noodle in Chinatown rather than japanese ramen.
Thompson L.}New York, NY}223}541}302}-1}4}1/29/2010}I love the Shoyu Ramen here!Very clean smooth broth also at the right temperature. The spinach was a nice touch. Fish cakes came out perfect... only 1 piece of pork ( a little over cooked for my taste).. plenty of bamboo shoots and an egg. Now that I got that out of the way... what about the ramen u ask? Awesome! The perfect chewiness... very heavy eggy taste to it. It was a pleasant surprise!
Peng C.}Buffalo, NY}28}8}0}-1}4}1/25/2010}This intimate little hole-in-the-wall makes you think that you've just walked into a neighborhood noodle shop in Tokyo. The broth is deep and flavorful but not quite as greasy and salty as the ones at Setagaya. Highly recommended for when you get those Ramen cravings!
Dave K.}Queens, NY}125}100}14}-1}1}1/25/2010}Rai Rai Ken was where I tried Japanese style ramen, early-on in the days before Ramenia... and how times have changed. Back then, the small 2'x8' runway behind the counter was full of Japanese chefs, steam from the water where they'd flash boil the noodles and the smell of pork being grilled for the soup base. Over the weekend, there were 3 Hispanic cooks doing the manual labor, a token Chinese manager who mumbled out orders and 2 or 3 sad looking slices of pork in my my broth. The ramen tasted every bit as good as how much effort they were obviously putting into it - which is to say mediocre. How the mighty have fallen... To cap it off, the manager walked out for a break while we were eating and came back and stood in front of us - reeking of cigarette smoke. Cause yeah, I wanna be sitting at a bar stool, inside of a walk-in closet, paying money to eat noodles with someone who stinks of tobacco. I started this review out with 2 stars, but the more I think about it, it doesn't even deserve that.
Anna H.}Brooklyn, NY}27}125}17}-1}4}1/17/2010}Oh my gosh I forgot about this place.  Thanks to my friend Fanny and my boyfriend I wouldn't have remember this place.  Fanny introduced this place to me three years ago and ever since that time I wanted to come back again but I just didn't because of my work place is located.  The first time I was here with Fanny we had to wait outside for about ten minutes but this time we didn't have to wait to be seated on a Friday night.  I am so happy that my boyfriend have brought me to this restaurant again because the food was so yummy.  We ordered gyoza and menma as our appetizers and they were delicious.  I can't recalled I have ever ordered menma from other restaurants before.  As for entree we ordered Shoyu ramen and Curry ramen.  The food is excellent.  I have no complaints and the price is right.  I will come back again soon for more menma.  This place just bring back good memories to me.One thing I would recommend to all Yelpers is that this place is small so I wouldn't recommend group of 4 or more to this place.
Amelia N.}Albany, CA}1}14}0}-1}4}1/16/2010}Rai Rai Ken can be inconsistent but when it's good it is soooooooooooooooooo good.  You must get the miso ramen with corn, extra garlic chips and use lots of the spice and you will be so happy.  Sometimes I sneak in a little sri racha for my own personal flavor.  I love the fact it is just a counter with 12 seats or so...the atmosphere really does it for me.
ash m.}New York, NY}0}12}0}-1}4}1/15/2010}first off, i love ramen and rai rai ken is one of the few places in the city that does it well. unfortunately its a cramped space with seating for 15 people on bar stools (i.e. my back got a bit sore). i am still giving it 4 stars because the food is very good and a good value - around $10. i like other ramen places that are fancier but the lines are too long and ramen is more expensive. this is a good go-to place for those that crave real ramen that doesn't break the bank, but don't mind tight quarters.
Donny O.}Los Angeles, CA}14}34}0}-1}4}1/11/2010}Rai Rai Ken is perfect for what it offers: cheap, good ramen.  Don't get it twisted: you're not going to find sushi or teriyaki bowls here, just simple, satisfying Ramen.  But I don't think people come here for anything other than that. Ramen is what Rai Rai Ken does best.  My friends and I ordered Shio, Shoyu, and Mabo ramen soup, respectively, and each of us was happy with what we ordered.  The gyoza were fried within an inch of their lives, but the soup followed quickly and I was down for the count.  The noodles were firm but not too starchy and the vegetables/herbs were fresh and fragrant.  The broth for the Mabo was hearty, developed, and satisfying given the arctic temperatures outside.  Service was brisk and simple: you are in and out in no time (judging by the cramped space and limited seating, I don't think management has a problem with that, either.)Credit cards are not accepted, so bring cash and an appetite.  Rai Rai Ken offers a great ramen meal, better than any I've had in Manhattan, for a price that's hard to beat.  If you are in the East Vil skip the neighbors to the left and right and make a stop here.  You won't be sorry.
Katie F.}Arlington, VA}91}489}97}-1}4}1/11/2010}Secret I learned from a local this weekend: Skip Momofuku noodle bar, go to milk bar to get your pork bun fix, then come here for cheaper helping of ramen.  Delicious, cozy, and authentic feeling.
Love M.}New York, NY}8}98}36}-1}4}1/11/2010}I believe this place is better place to eat ramen than Setagaya or other places. Because it is reasonably priced. I gave up ramen in NY but I could go back there when it's  really cold out and need a great noodle soup to warm up my heart.This is a kind of places you see a girl eating alone.  My favorite is definitely Shoyu Ramen.
Jenny J.}Brooklyn, NY}27}308}6}-1}4}1/5/2010}out of all the ramen places that i have been to in the city, the noodles (in themselves) here were the best noodles served.  broth is plain and they're a bit stingy on the chashu.  they could also use without the black peppers on the bamboo.
Wing L.}Brooklyn, NY}454}371}2028}-1}4}1/2/2010}A few years back, before the explosion of high end Ramen places all over Manhattan, I discovered this little gem.  At the time, it was the best ramen I could find and found them to be very tasty.  I read that the owner/cook was a ramen chef from Japan before he decided to move to NYC. He makes all his soup base from scratch and it shows.Fast forward a few years, Ippudo opened and I got to try what everyone called the best Ramen in NYC.  It blew me away. I decided to go back to Rai Rai Ken to see how it holds up after having tasted Ippudo or was it all just fond memories. It's been a while since I've been to this place. About 2 years I think.I ordered the Curry Ramen and started eating.  The curry broth was very good and flavorful.  The ramen have the same good texture and chewiness that Ippudo's have.  The egg was just a plain boiled egg where Ippudo's egg is like a art form in your mouth with the yolk slightly runny and infused with flavor somehow.  They only provide you with one slice of pork here.  This version tastes like good pork while Ippudo's taste like pork that melts in your mouth like butter.Despite the comparision, the ramen was still very good.  It's a little unfair to compare the two anyway since eating the ramen here costs only $7.00 to $9.00 while Ippudo would set you back $13 and up for one bowl. It might be a good alternative if you crave good ramen but Ippudo is booked or you are unwilling to spend too much on good ramen but are not willing to settle for Cup a Noodle.  It's also only a few blocks from Ippudo. I used to think that paying 7 to 9 bucks for a bowl of ramen was expensive and now I think it's a bargain compared to what many of the trendier places charge these days.  Oh how things have changed over these last few short years.They accept cash only.  The place is real small.  Look up "hole in the wall" in the dictionary and they might have a picture of this place. There are no tables, only counter space around the cooking area.  Walk in there and you feel like you've transported to Tokyo.  You'll understand if you ever walk in.
PJ R.}New York, NY}1}33}4}-1}3}1/2/2010}A cozy place, with surly staff, both of which made me expect better ramen. It was okay.
Nam C.}Palisades, NY}4}23}1}-1}4}12/20/2009}I don't really like to make a distinct comparison, but in the world somewhere there is a place better than Rai Rai Ken. Currently it is the best place to get ramen within Manhattan. Now to talk about the actual food. I had Shoyu Ramen. The broth was much more different than what I expected. It was complex and very rich. They must have used special type of soy sauce and pork stock. Noodles were surprisingly kicking, it means almost al dente-ish. Chiashu, the slice of pork meat, is good, but not exactly what I expected or how I wanted it. When I was staying in Wakayama province just one hour away from Osaka. There was a very famous ramen place. People stopped by the city just to eat there. The Chiashu from that place melts in your mouth and that was what I was hoping for. For a side dish, I had a Gyoza there. It was definitely home made. The wrappings were little bit loose, the stuffing was little bit lacking in flavor too. The meat was not flavored enough. The restaurant was something what I expected. Very earthy I guess, it does remind me of the restaurants in Japan. The restaurant has a very rustic feel and they are very friendly. Place is very small, because it is sandwich-ed between two other restaurants. It is a very nice place to go for a lunch. It's a bit of walk for me, but it's nice to go there once in awhile.Still the food was very satsifying for the price they asked. I will return soon as I try some more restaurants. This place is still number one place for me get ramen in New York.
Santosh K.}New York, NY}78}21}4}-1}4}12/18/2009}Let me start by saying, Rai Rai Ken is in my inner circle of places to go in the United States.I'm from Texas, but I spend a lot of time in the City, and the thing is that most papers etc., end up giving reviews to really big places, or places that end up becoming big because of the reviews.  I happened upon Rai Rai Ken because I was lost.  I actually noticed Curry-ya next door, and the other place on the other next door, and missed this place twice.  But their glowing red lamp outside caught my attention, and when I peeked behind the curtains in front of the door, I was captivated.  Small, narrow, and very cozy, it seemed to be a wormhole into Japan.  Sure, the chefs weren't Japanese, but everything else was so different, I had to try it.The first thing that made me feel hesitant was that it was cash only, and I had only $30 with me.  But when I looked at the menu, I realized that this simple menu was reasonably priced and inviting.  I got me a green tea, which was apparently very authentically done because green tea, as done in many places, is actually toasted with oil, and you can taste that here.I ended up starting with the Curry Ramen, but have subsequently tried a variety of their dishes.  They are all wonderfully tasty and satisfying.I took a friend, who has an eye for details.  She was a bit afraid at first, so she went and checked out the rest room.  In her opinion, the restroom was way clean, and she was very impressed.Hands down, the best find in my treasure trove of Santosh's Spots.
emily ahn l.}Brooklyn, NY}12}37}0}-1}4}12/8/2009}i love the atmosphere here. they could serve me slop with a side of butter and i'd probably eat it up. with that said, the ramen is good. the broth can be a little under developed - but its basic, hot, and made to order on the cheap. i like the small influences of korean foods too. and you can be in and out in 15 minutes, or stay for an hour if you like. what more could one ask from a simple, laid back neighborhood spot?
alice x.}Long Island City, NY}13}58}2}-1}5}12/5/2009}the noodles here are the best in town. yes, ippudo has hands-down the best broth, and other places might do better chashu or better toppings, but rai rai ken wins in the noodle category.  i don't even know if they make them in house, but the noodles here are slightly thicker and have the springy bite that elevates fresh japanese ramen above other, lesser noodles.lots of commenters have complained about the too salty broth. my advice? add CORN to it. i was once in a tokyo ramen shop that served broth WAY saltier than is comfortable (and i ADORE salt), but they included lots of sweet corn as a topping, which tasted great against all that briny goodness.i love the cozy atmosphere of this place. it's really something special... if you're lucky enough to find an available seat (go in groups of 2 or 3 tops!)
Jonathan W.}New York, NY}95}36}0}-1}3}12/2/2009}*.*oO. I can't say I loved it, I can't say I disliked it. But, the ramen I got, the Shio, was.... *drum roll*.. -- "salty". Well, guess they got the 'shio' part right, but it was too salty for my taste. Not enough soupy broth flavour. (Try the miso or shoyu)On the other hand, noodles were good, the atmosphere was ramen Japanese-y, counter and all, and best of all, we got hooks to hang our coats right behind us. Brilliant!Quick d.l. on the Dumplings: itty bitty pricy, but nonetheless scrumptious. (They could be crispier & meatier though!)ta-dah! Ramen #2. bow
Grace L.}New York, NY}16}90}0}-1}4}11/24/2009}Rai Rai Ken is the perfect spot to be when its rainy, windy, cold, and dark out.  Yes, there are snazzier ramen places out there, but Rai Rai is consistent, comforting, and fast.  Oh yea, and tasty.   The ramen is generously portioned, with noodles that are just the right amount of firmness and the beers are on the cheap side.  I go for the curry ramen - the broth is slightly thicker than the other varieties, with the teensiest bit of heat to combat the cold and an order of the gyoza.
Justine H.}New York, NY}61}141}0}-1}3}11/23/2009}curry ramen. shoyu ramen. roast pork with scallions app. 2 buckwheat ales.plus - quick service. chewy noodles. hot broth.. perfect for winter. i love pork with scallions.minus - it's HOT in there. you will smell like salty broth when you leave. the broth is a little too salty. CASH only.
Jared C.}New York, NY}185}339}735}-1}4}11/22/2009}They do not have my favorite tonkatsu ramen here, but offer three other varieties that all satisfy. Rai Rai Ken definitely wins for atmosphere and a general level of hush that can be rare to find in a popular East Village restaurant. All the selections are actually quite good, and it is such a positive experience to sit down, slurp a bowl of noodles, and go on with your day.
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}3}11/20/2009}Tis good. Good for the price. 8 dollar bowl of ramen definitely satisfied my cravings. Very small place, very Japanesy. The pork wasn't as tender and juicy as I expected. The broth didn't have much depth. I'd go for Setagaya instead.
Kris P.}El Paso, TX}204}201}592}-1}3}11/17/2009}Ken has a special place in my heart. He and I met on a cold winter day 2 odd years ago, on a special trip to NYC during December. He was my savior - from the cold, the snow, the rain, and the dirty streets of the east village. He was a beacon of light, my first, my...well, you get the picture.I didn't know that Ramen joints like this existed in NY and Rai Rai Ken was my introduction to real ramen. And I've been hooked since then.This place is like what every other review describes - small, narrow, red, cozy and cramped. The ramen dudes behind the counter are Japanese and makes me think that my bowl is that much more authentic. Some may not like the cozy quarters of the restaurant, but it was exactly what I wanted that day. It wasn't too busy, so it was nice to sit at the end of the counter and share in the goodness of ramen and the warmth of the room.The broth is flavorful, although a bit salty for me. The fried rice was pretty good too. They don't give as much meat as some joints, but everything was well balanced.If Rai Rai hadn't been there for me that day, who knows how many more years I would have lived in ramen-ignorance.
Helen L.}Tampa, FL}334}455}2173}18}4}11/11/2009}What's the best thing to warm you up on a cloudy chilly day? Ramen! Ramen from Rai Rai Ken! This is a TINY narrow place. Tiny and narrow! It's best to only go with a small group of less than 4 since there is only bar seating with swivel chairs. Menus are posted up on the counter in front of you as you shout you order of choice. The curry ramen was really good. The scallions fresh and the ramen just right. The broth was light yet had a hint of curry. It was a hint too salty but it was forgivable as I slurped the ramen up. The gyoza and half shrimp fried were good as sides to share with your company. I wouldn't order the cha seew or kim chi since I have that pretty often. I'd definitely return for the other ramens. Too bad I have to wait till the summer for the cold ramens!
Nari L.}New York, NY}96}50}7}-1}3}11/10/2009}Love the atmosphere of this hole-in-the wall ramen joint.  It's always exciting to sit at a bar (the only seats available) and have the ramen chef actually serve you.  I had the half fried rice with seafood (shrimps n scallops), which was pleasantly delicious.  It wasn't too oily and had a clean after taste, exactly what fried rice at a ramen place should be like.  For the ramen, I chose the Shio ramen, which had a very clean flavor as well.  It wasn't too oily (like other ramen joints..aka Ippudo), and i would say the flavor was quite nice.  However, i wish they gave me more pork slices (i think i had ONE slice in there..booo).  And, after a while.. the ramen just started to get a little boring.  I also had the luxury of trying the Shoyu ramen, which had a deeper flavor, but was also a bit boring.  I felt like they just used the broth of shio and added soy sauce to it (which they most likely did).  I don't blame them for this technique but just saying it can get quite 'blah'!We had to order a pickled dish from the appetizer section, of course being korean, i needed that little umph.  We didn't want to go with kimchi because that would probably overpower the ramen and kill the flavor, so we went with the takuwan (radish pickle).  I would say this was a ripoff, they give you about 5 slices- and this should just be included as a side dish with the ramen.  But of course, that's just my opinion....Overall, it was still a good experience, as which most ramen experiences are for me. :)  I probably wouldn't come back here until I tried allllll the ramen places in the city.
darcey h.}New York, NY}324}183}128}-1}3}11/8/2009}Konnichiwa! This place makes me feel like I'm in Japan  in more ways than one. Size (super small), atmosphere (steamy, busy, no nonsense), and best of all quality (outstanding, authentic, top notch).  their broth was perfectly seasoned, not greasy, the pork was plentiful but not overwhelming and the noodles were done expertly.  I will definitely return again.  it ranks right up there with Setegaya.  It gets 3 stars only because it is small and can get a bit warm in there. May be a problem for some for I think it's part of the ambiance.
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}4}11/8/2009}Rai Rai Ken isn't just a hole in the wall - it is a very slender hole in the wall.  Everything happens in close quarters, with the ramen assembly taking place on the other side of counter style seating.  While this set-up means hell for claustrophobics, for rameniacs, it recalls the austere noodle shops of Japan, all rustic wood and rising steam.The menu is blessedly short, as should be expected from a place so small.  Thin-skinned gyoza steamed to piping hot submission make for a great appetizer.  The shoyu ramen is rather lackluster, a poor sign for a ramen shop, but the miso is fantastic.  Deeply flavorful and loaded with goodies like chicken and crispy garlic, it's definitely the right choice.For authenticity, Rai Rai Ken tops all other ramen shops I've tried in New York.  The set-up is very Japanese, and the place is operated by an entirely Japanese staff.  The noodles, however, are not the best in town.  That said, they are cheaper than say, equivalent bowls at Ippudo or Momofuku, and that miso is nothing to sneeze at.
Michelle T.}Mountain View, CA}153}103}64}-1}4}10/29/2009}Great ramen shop! I loooove the Shio Ramen! The Miso ramen is delicious as well, and never tried the Shoyu. I ate here around 8 PM on a Friday night, and no wait! Yay! Sure, the place is small and if you're a germophobe, don't eat here. But you're going to miss out on yummy and cheap ramen. Your loss.The authentic atmosphere is always a plus. The signs, banners, and "rusty" brick walls and the wooden bar-like dining makes me happy! I'm not a fan of fancy Japanese eating, especially when it comes to ramen. They serve REAL noodles (not that plastic stuff in instant noodles) packed with flavour, and low maintenance. Just like how it should be.
molly p.}Los Angeles, CA}12}27}0}-1}3}10/25/2009}I went here the first time for Hiyashi Chuka, the classic summertime cold noodle dish (and one of my favorite foods ever).  We went for lunch and it was quiet and fast.  I'd say this place gets four stars between May and September for that dish.  I went back and had the Miso Ramen... while it was good, it was not great by any means.  It was so salty that I ate the noodles and had to leave the broth (usually my favorite part).  Also, for a 9$ bowl of soup, I'd like more than three small chunks of cold chicken.  But hey, maybe that's just my American prejudice to lots of meat.  On the plus side, the food comes about 35 seconds after you order.I love the old wooden bar, and it's a great place to go alone since there are no tables.  On the other hand, this set up makes for very close proximity to your neighbors.  Man o man, on one side I had a cooing new couple trying to impress each other with stupid stories told at full volume (one too many Sopporos?).  On the other I had a man texting with furious speed, only to give up on that and switch to a very loud and heated cell phone discussion with someone who had ruined his night. Yeah. I was in and out of there in about 10 minutes.  In the future I'll stick to summer lunches.
Kelly K.}South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia}15}102}11}-1}2}10/22/2009}This used to be my all time favorite place for ramen in NYC so it makes me really sad to say that the quality of their ramen has declined.  I used to LOVE their broth and the slices of thick, fatty pork.  But sadly, with the onslaught of ramen bars opening up in the city, Rai Rai Ken has not been able to hold it together.  I still like the size and atmosphere of the place but unless they improve the quality of their ramen to what it was a few years ago, I don't think I will be returning.
Jennie A.}Brooklyn, NY}96}138}76}-1}4}10/22/2009}The annoying part about this place is that when it's busy, they don't take names down.  They don't take reservations either.  It's a whole in the wall so you have to wait outside with everyone else that is waiting to get in. The mabu tofu ramen was yummy.  The portions are pretty big.  The shio ramen was good too.  I haven't been to many ramen places so I have yet to see how this compares to others.This place is also cash only so be prepared.  I tried to eat here again and had to leave because they don't take debit.
CL R.}Sacramento, CA}3}160}1}-1}4}10/14/2009}This is my NYC standby. I love this place. I have yet to go to Ippudo-- so this review isn't for comparison. Rai Rai Ken is just good in its own right. And the prices are the best I've seen for quality ramen-- at roughly $8 a bowl.I've had both the miso and the shoyu ramen. Both are great. If anything, they can be a bit under-salted by my standards. But the pork is tender with ribbons of good fat, the broth is porky and the noodles are perfectly al dente.
Phoebe J.}Kewadin, MI}395}347}389}-1}4}10/12/2009}Ramen heaven in the East Village, Rai Rai Ken stands out as the best Japanese noodles in NYC in my eyes. No frills authentic shop, a friendly staff of soup chefs and incredible Miso Ramen soup. My boyfriend loves the Gyoza- but I usually stick with their amazing soups. Brings me into the world of Tampopo- and always proves to make us incredibly happy. Enjoy some yourself this winter...
Sean S.}Manhattan, NY}743}1655}34}18}1}10/12/2009}Well... I should have known better... you know all these ramen places, no matter what they say or what they promise, put pork in on and over everything you touch.  As I've been a vegetarian for a very long time, this not only annoys me (okay it kinda pisses me off) but it also turns my stomach with oh about 20-25 minutes, and I'm hittin the can.So upon ordering a miso-broth soup with mixed vegetables, and a hard boiled egg on top, I was surprised to find the flavor rather... um funky.  I tried eating a bit, for the sake of my friend who had joined me.  I don't like to be a party downer if I can avoid it.  But she didn't like her ma-bo tofu either.    What's more I ordered Menma which is "marinated bamboo shoots, seaweed, scallion, red pepper mix, soy sauce" and despite that, I'm am very sure there was pork in that sauce too.  wtfThe layout of the place is fine I guess, but there isn't any service per se, just the cook behind the bar who will take your order and serve you.  Anyway, I have something in my stomach now which will take me a few days to get rid of, so I don't feel any sorrow over my one-star review.  They suck!
Aka C.}New York, NY}34}98}26}-1}3}10/11/2009}We came here because the wait at Ippudo was ridiculous (we got there around 6:20 and the wait was 1.5-2 hrs... what!?). The ramen was ok, nothing to rave about, the the place itself felt  (looked) a lot like a Japanese ramen stop. Of course that also means you're somewhat squeezed for space. The food itself was... well... it's ramen. Good, but not awesome. But it's still decent ramen.The service was quite good and quick. When we were leaving we saw a rather long line though. I think this probably wouldn't be one of my "hotspots," especially if I have to wait more than 1/2 an hr for a seat, but if there's no line and I feel like ramen (or yakisoba), I would definitely give this place a try.
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}3}9/30/2009}It's ramen and I can't ever say no to ramen! It's good but I wouldn't say great. I would choose Ippudo over Rai Rai Ken anyday but there's not wait here so maybe for a quick fix I'd come here. I've been here twice...had their mabo tofu ramen, which was good and the next time had their miso ramen (I thought this was good too). The gyozas were actually really good! I'd come back just for those. The place looks exactly like something you'd see in Japan, and that's what you don't get in Ippudo. Everyone speaks Japanese here too:) It's very tiny...probably only fits 10 ppl max. So again...don't bring your whole family to a place like this unless you want to take it over! :)
Sumi C.}New York, NY}4}13}1}-1}3}9/24/2009}So we stopped in here for a late-night dinner, and we enjoyed it.  3-Stars may look like it's not-that-great, but no, it was pretty good overall.  I think this experience was a bit disapointing for me simply due to the fact that Tampopo is one of my favorite movies of all time.As a litmus test, we both ordered the standard Shoyu Ramen, and shared sides of Kimchi & Menma.  This was our first time here and we ordered in a hurry, so we didn't realize that Menma comes in their Shoyu Ramen, even though, duh!--I would expect any reputable ramen shop to do so.  I guess I saw the option to add toppings including butter, corn, extra pork, and sides, etc, and thought -- well, it wouldn't hurt to have it as a side since I love Menma, just in case they don't add it automatically.  We are still in NY, and not Tokyo, after all.And for those of you that don't know, Menma is marinated bamboo shoots that are soft, not crunchy, and have a very similar texture and flavor profile to sauteed mushrooms that have been marinated in a bit of sesame oil, black pepper, and garlic, and then stir-fried, like Korean-style banchan. Delicious!!!  However, it was a tad on the salty side, even though I'm a salt lover --esp b/c the soup broth in the ramen was a bit salty.  It was still very tasty.Unfortunately, it was rather hot by the kitchen, and after having walked around in heels on a hot humid night in NY, I decided to opt for a seat that didn't face the ramen cooks.  So, I couldn't watch them prepare our noodle bowls and that was kind of a big bummer for me (and if you've seen and loved Tampopo, you'll know exactly what I mean).  Oh, and the stools were jammed pretty close together -- at least where we were sitting by the front window, it was borderline not-enough-elbow-room so that you couldn't help but touch your neighbor's arms even if you're contorting / twisting your body so that you're not constantly on top or underneath their arms while talking to them, and it didn't help the fact that my boyfriend is tall with long arms.  But, once you hunch down to eat, it's fairly comfortable b/c then you're hovering over your bowl and so are they.  Like selfish, selfish pigs.  Selfish quiet little pigs who are too busy slurping to engage one another... well, at least for the first few slurps.The Menma and Kimchi came out first so we could nosh on it while we waited for our ramen.  Like I said, the Menma was good, a little salty, and the Kimchi was excellent, but was different from Kimchi I've had growing up (like normal Korean kimchi!!).  It had some sort of extra flavor that was almost smoky for some reason, and it seemed to be missing a lot of great garlic and ginger flavors.  But it was still very good, came sprinkled with a generous garnish of chopped scallions, and had just the right amount of salt and spiciness.  Well, it wasn't spicy at all for me, but my BF said it was a bit spicy for him -- and I grew up being the only one in my family who needed to wash my kimchi when I was little, often to their ridicule that I wasn't really Korean or one of the family, but an abandoned gypsy baby adopted by them b/c they felt sorry for me.  No, it wasn't funny! -- but they had a hoot, and I eventually learned how to eat red Kimchi and found that it wasn't that spicy, as my overly sensitive baby-tastebuds deadened a bit with age and constant introductions to "difficult" foods.Then the Shoyu Ramen arrived and almost knocked me upside the head -- literally!  We were sitting with our backs to them and couldn't see that our food had arrived and all of a sudden a large shadow looms over my head and I can see in my peripheral vision that something big is sailing slowly toward me, so I gasped and turned, almost knocking my head right into my bowl of soup!  So, be on the lookout when you're sitting with your back to the goodly ramen cooks b/c they can sneak up on you like hot noodle soup toting ninjas and put a hurt on you!The Shoyu Ramen didn't have the very complex broth that I was looking for.  It tasted like a "decent" beef-based broth with soy sauce added to it.  There weren't many tiny bubbles of fat on top of the broth that glitter the broth which was odd --something I look for in a great bowl of ramen, and it was heavily salted to the point that adding more of the salty Menma seemed, I don't know... harmful.  The ramen noodles had a nice healthy golden color from the eggs in it, and felt smooth and elastic, with a nice firm bite to them; very good.  They were a bit on the heavier side of ramen noodles, but still, the noodles really shine, overall.  There's also a nice, 1cm thick slice of rolled and roasted pork with some bits of fat clinging to it that was delicious!  I ate the rest of my BF's pork when he said he was full, so I almost got another whole piece!  heehee!  =)Overall: good value, good impression.  Will come back to try the Miso, Curry, & MaPo Tofu Ramen.
Keith D.}New York, NY}4}31}0}-1}4}9/7/2009}Miso ramen is exceptional.  The fried rice is exceptional.  If you order either or both of those, you will have an exceptional, satisfying, happy tummy meal.I stick to these for the most part, but the other dishes are nice, too.I have to say, the fried rice caught me by surprise.  I expected great soup at this place.  But it turns out that the fried rice isn't just great, it may be the best on the planet.  (A foodie friend of mine has tried and tried to duplicate the flavors of the Rai Rai Ken rice at home...but he's now given up, saying it's just not possible.)The joint is kinda cute.  I'm told it's "authentic."  Though I'm a sucker for a cute place, that wouldn't make a difference to the flavor--and it's the flavor that keeps me coming back.  And while I'm sure authenticity matters for some reason (I guess if you're looking for a cultural experience), that doesn't have anything to do with how it tastes to me.  (It's a really small place, just one longish counter with 10 or 12 seats.)So cute, authentic.  I guess.  But I go because I'm craving ramen and I know I'm gonna have some happy moments in Rai Rai Ken!
Kat H.}New York, NY}2}11}0}-1}5}9/3/2009}When I'm in the area, this is where I NEED to go. It's perfect for a quick and satisfying meal. I always get their curry ramen and I'm never sick of it. I love their decor as well. Even though it's a hole-in-the-wall sort of place, the decor really makes the whole dining experience so much better.
Ramenista H.}New York, NY}2}2}0}-1}2}8/30/2009}I really wanted to love this place.  It's authentic.  It's one of the old and authentic NY Ramen joints.  BUT.  Even tho I keep going back, when I'm out of other ideas (that should tell you something) and in the hopes that it will be better... ultimately it's a "meh".  Their Nori, as a topping, is great.  It's the most memorable part of their ramen.  The old fashioned counter, and very authentic feel and look to the entire place, makes one think "ooh this must be real".  But unfortunately, it's bland.  It's not bad, it's just... not very savory.  If you think other popular places are too salty, or too flavorful, you might like this.  The thing is, I still will go back there, from time to time.  It feels like an old down town Tokyo ramen joint, where tired and drunk salarymen will stagger in after work.  It feels like an old piece of ramen culture in Tokyo.  To me, that's more appealing, even comforting, than a trendy, but not-so-authentic new age ramen place.(This review is from my Ramen blog: nycramen.com/2009/08/rai… )
David G.}Oakland, CA}2}93}2}-1}4}8/18/2009}Come here to try ramen other than plain soy. They have good miso and curry ramen more impressive than the average ramen place. It is small and crowded but is good for a dinner with a friend. Price is o.k
Amy P.}Brooklyn, NY}12}64}20}-1}2}8/17/2009}Should I only give this place two start??? I should give it three because the service was great and fast, the seating was comfortable and they have gyoza on the menu unlike so many ramen places these days. Also the price was RIGHT! BUT there was chicken on the miso ramen.... and I don't mean delicious chicken, I mean like mealy, dry chicken out of the salad bar at Jazzys! The gyoza was not as well done as I like. Still, this is ramen! I guess I should have gotten the shoyu ramen. It's not a bad place.
Dennis C.}Singapore, Singapore}91}244}49}-1}2}8/15/2009}Had the zha jiang men and it was disappointingly bland, although to be fair, I'd only previously had the Chinese and Korean versions of this noodle dish, and it's possible the Japanese version is just meant to be plainer.  It's tiny and cramped, without air conditioning, so be prepared to sweat in the summer, especially if you're having a steamy bowl of ramen (which I will say is pretty good, as I sampled my wife's).The best part is that the "CASH ONLY" sign is placed right on the bathroom door.
Trevor H.}Brooklyn, NY}2}20}0}-1}2}8/11/2009}Blah.The ramen was very mediocre, but affordable. The noodles were way overcooked, but the broth was nice considering it was MSG-free (supposedly). Still as a bowl it's probably the worst I've ever had. I guess you get what you pay for. Considering it is 5 dollars less than most other authentic ramen places, I might have let them off with three stars, if not for the terrible, horrible, gyoza. God this gyoza sucked. It was small, greasy and had an odd flavor profile. On a whole it was worse than frozen.Service was good. I might give them a second chance cheap ramen is a powerful opiate. Just don't get the gyoza.
rachel r.}San Francisco, CA}15}86}7}-1}4}8/5/2009}super cute place.  i love that down home personal vibe that seem only to be visible in mom and pop shops.anyway, is it terrible to say that i like the ramen from ramen setagaya better?but i love the feel of the place so much so i have to give them 4 stars.
Mirai S.}Woodside, NY}15}143}0}-1}3}8/5/2009}Not bad.  The ramen here is authentic but nothing special.The fried rice here however is probably one of the best tasting Japanese fried rice I've ever had in NY.
Tan C.}New York, NY}9}43}0}-1}3}7/22/2009}Quick. Fast. Cheap. Small. Limited. Narrow. Decent ramen. Not the best but definitely  ramen worthy. Came here for lunch so it was really empty. Had the basic Shoyu Ramen - soy sauce based noodle soup topped with bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed, and scallion. Pretty decent. not overly salty. Worth the 8 bucks, since it's like a "fast food" ramen place.
Yi J.}New York, NY}7}49}1}-1}3}7/20/2009}Cheap, simply and fast.  It's a good place to go by yourself.  The ramen is okay, nothing to write home about.  They only have small counter seats, so if you're really tall or big, you might want to reconsider.  Make sure to grab one of their stamp collection card.  One meal will get you one stamp.  Once you have collected 10, you get treated to a free ramen.
Bobby B.}Brooklyn, NY}14}58}1}-1}4}7/14/2009}For having grown up in Japan, the set up and feel of this place is definitely the "RAMEN-YA."  Its a thin and long room with a counter and kitchen extending down one side, and a row of stools on the other side to eat from the counter.  The ramen quality is not bad.  Obviously its hard to compete with what is in Japan when abroad, but for being in America its good.  I definitely satisfies my Ramen craving.  Try it!
P W.}Long Island City, NY}3}39}0}-1}4}7/12/2009}Love it! A friend introduced me to this place and now I go every once in a while when I feel like dealing with the East Village, which has become quite mediocre. I love the old school vibe and no frills service.Nice hearty meal that won't break the bank!
Sara W.}San Francisco, CA}44}417}8}-1}4}7/11/2009}I use to live right across the street and in the winter time, this was a wonderful haven from the cold for me. The ramen is delicious, affordable and both soothing and spicy.
nick l.}San Jose, CA}73}47}18}-1}2}7/2/2009}The Miso broth was a little too salty. Noodles were so-soAnd I was expecting roast pork in my ramen, only to be disappointed by plain chicken..
David F.}Johnson City, TN}1}5}0}-1}5}7/2/2009}This was my first experience with real Ramen, and I was very impressed.  The seating is tight, and the place was really hot, but that just seemed to add to the experience.  I had one of the new additions to the menu.  I think it was called Mobi Ramen. It was really excellent.  The ramen was cooked perfectly, the broth was savory and the slightly spicy ground pork was just right.  The tofu gave a nice textural variation to the dish.The service was efficient and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable.  It will definitely be on my agenda the next time I am in town.
Annie H.}Santa Monica, CA}3}9}0}-1}4}6/29/2009}Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  Perfect Ramen--no.  But pretty damn good.  What a little gem of a place.  The service and the ambiance makes it great too.  Sometimes the wait at night can be long.  Always had consistent great service.  I miss eating there since I've moved back to LA.
Barbie L.}New York, NY}55}158}547}-1}2}6/19/2009}Heard about it for a while, but quite disappointing when I finally went, probably because the rash of invading Ramen Setagayas are so amazing.Rai Rai Ken has very bland, "old fashined" broth choices/completely forgetable/not enough depth of flavors.The space is so narrow I was playing full-body Tetris with fellow diners and our coats and belongings. Too much of a workout for me! Won't be returning.
audri n.}Brooklyn, NY}23}12}0}-1}5}6/17/2009}This is my favorite ramen place in NYC thus far.  Tiny spot, and NOT good for groups.  But the ramen is cheap, vegetarian-friendly, and the side dishes are a good addition to a bowl of ramen.  Service is quick, the waiters are not rude and I've had nothing but fantastic experiences here.
Helena Z.}Brooklyn, NY}48}264}0}-1}4}6/7/2009}Tiny ramen place. Delicious
Jonathan W.}Calgary, Canada}1346}592}5}-1}4}5/19/2009}This place occupies a unique ramen niche than Ippudo and Momofuku Noodle Bar. It is fast food Ramen, tight counter seating and cheap (8.50 vs 14-16 dollars at Ippudo or Momo)That being said, good portions, the Shoyu and Shio ramen are both solidly hearty and tasty. Considering the price gouging going on at Momofuku Noodle Bar (2 pork steamed buns for $9 and $16 ramen bowl), I'd welcome a visit to Rai Rai Ken anytime.
brian g.}Austin, TX}9}89}2}-1}5}5/14/2009}consistently delivers delicious, fresh, simple food that makes the wallet happy.  have eaten here 10+ times and never had a bad meal.  get there before  7pm or lines will go out the door.  this is a feeding trough style place, good for a quick meal or solo, but not much of a hang out spot.
MJ H.}Flushing, NY}8}146}303}-1}3}5/8/2009}MJ's Star : 3Price : remen $8.50 (except tip & tax)
Michael S.}Castro Valley, CA}15}226}22}-1}3}4/9/2009}Cheap place to get Ramen. They have a nice Shoyu Ramen. It is lighter than most of the other Ramen places in NY. It is more of a fast food joint too. The place does get real busy at peak hours so be ready for a little wait. I think it is the cheapest of the Ramen houses in the E village.
J. G. B.}Los Angeles, CA}61}78}7}-1}4}3/28/2009}A man told me the pink thing that was floating in my ramened-soup was some sort of fish. Indeed.
Mona W.}New York, NY}182}120}7}-1}3}3/26/2009}A tiny alley like noodle spot with average ramen. I thought the broth wasn't as hearty as I would have liked but still satisfying. The shoyu ramen was a bit too bland for me but the curry ramen was very good!
nicola m.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}4}3/23/2009}Really good eats for a really good price! Kinda small, but intimate. They have Tofu, which is awesome because other Ramen places don't offer that. Good eats for sure! And you don't leave hungry (unless you are used to eating a pound of noodles as an appetizer). In comparison to Momofuku, much bigger bang for your buck here and more authentic.
Mo Riza ..}New York, NY}139}206}1126}-1}3}3/21/2009}I lost my east village noodle virginity here. Even tough I have been going out with the neighboring Setagaya and Momofuku, I still come back for that nostalgic moment ;)
tony t.}Bronx, NY}499}130}4}-1}2}3/17/2009}originally i was going to shabu tatsu that was next door but they weren't open. so me and my friend go into rai rai ken and decided to have some ramen.service was quick since it was in such a small space and everything was pretty much at the bar. really limited menu in terms of what you can order to eat, not many choices of ramen variations either.after spending $9 for their ramen i thought the bowl would satisfy my hunger but it really didn't. this is a kind of place where you can have a main course and if you'd like to go out for desert afterwards you'll have room for it.overall it's a different twist on ramen but i've tasted and made better.
Brent R.}Los Angeles, CA}247}22}0}-1}4}3/6/2009}For the price, 5 stars.  I'm a big, big fan of this place.  It's one of my favorite places to meet for an early dinner.  If you try to go too late, the line can be long (especially on a chilly night).  This place is about as unpretentious as you can get.  It's all counter style seating, and you're liable to be shoulder-to-shoulder with a stranger, but that's what gives it some of its charm.  The ramen is delicious, very authentic, and the portions are HUGE.  I think my favorite is the curry ramen.  Also, the seaweed salad is good (which I'm a sticker for).  I actually think it's a great place to take a date (unless he/she is bougie... in which case, why are you dating that @$$hole?), or catch up with someone.  Ultra casual, which is nice... keeps things light.
Kate K.}Queens, NY}27}131}15}-1}3}3/2/2009}The place is very tiny with bar style seating.  You can watch the cooks prepare your food.   I had the Shoyu ramen here.  It was oilier than Ippudo's and the broth wasn't as flavorful.  The meat didn't melt in your mouth like that of Ippudo's either.  Good for a quick hunger fix but if you're looking for a good ramen then I recommend Ippudo instead.
Bing S.}San Mateo, CA}83}102}0}-1}5}2/28/2009}my favorite noodle shop in the city...   i love the miso flavored ramen though the shoyu is good too.  i liked their more brownish counter top with the small reflective mirrors instead of the boring one they have now.    supposedly gridskipper thinks they have the best gyoza in town but i'm not willing to say that..
Daniela F.}New York, NY}74}134}4}-1}4}2/22/2009}Rai Rai Ken is a neighborhood fave for me. Summer, Spring, Winter or Fall, it's cozy and satisfying.  All of the ramens are tasty, nothing too salty. I will say that I have also ordered delivery and it disappoints because the noodles are mush by the time they get to you and you chow down.This is really a spot to jump in and out of -- I don't recommend heading with too many people because the space is super small. I love it though because it's intimate and quick.Bonus: Whatever iPod they play...it's always a decent soundtrack for slurping.
Peramelon P.}Miami, FL}4}54}35}-1}3}2/21/2009}Cozy place, OK Ramen.Trying to find a substitute for Setagaya Ramen Rai Rai Ken appeared. It does not close during some time at lunchtime, so that favors Rai Rai Ken. The place is quite small at first sight, and you have to get lucky to find a spot, but once you are sat, it feels OK. Ramens are good (curry Ramen's broth is pretty good) overall, but noodles are just a bit oily and the eggs are just bolied eggs (Setagaya's are amazing!). Good one for satisfying your crave for Ramen. Not excellent, but good Ramen at good price.
Amanda S.}New York, NY}52}152}0}-1}3}2/20/2009}So what if it's not the best ramen in the city?  It still fixes my cravings...I like all the ramen flavors they have, but their miso ramen is a bit too heavy for me (it's oilier than any other miso ramen I've had).  Not sure if I'd be eating there as frequently if it wasn't across the street from my boyfriend's apartment....the noodles are still $7.50/bowl so you can't beat that.An interesting experience I had at Rai Rai Ken was when it got later (around midnight-2am) one night, the Japanese chefs went home and there were only Mexican chefs left.  They were friendly and great.  Then they started blasting Mexican music--it was an amusing scene as I slurped my noodles and pretended that I was in Cabo...Gotta love it.
Jordan B.}White Plains, NY}0}14}0}-1}3}2/15/2009}I'm no asian noodle expert, but my friend was ranting and raving about this noodle place. We sat down and after 10 minutes of defrosting we were ready to order. The menu... didn't have much that looked tasty to me. I'm not a seafood fan, I just wanted something hearty and hot. I wound up getting the tofu version my of one of their noodle soups my friend said was amazing. For the moment it wasn't bad, but I was a little grossed out by the fishy undertones. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again
Kelvin T.}New York, NY}56}285}19}-1}1}2/13/2009}Read my review on Sapporo, as i usually - for context purposes, compare like kind fare. This place is just lacking in authenticity (ramen chop suey), noodles have no structure, broth is tasteless, limited variety, limited seating, and if you're sitting in front of the stove your gonna smell like it. Upside for 50 year old men is ogling and making indecent advances to freshmen and sophomores trying to educated them about the crap they're shoving in their mouths. Downside the irritating babel around you from the freshmen and sophomores that are not being educated or shoving crap in their mouths. PS if you had to look up chop suey - you'll probably love this place. Just a little humour.
yoshi u.}New York, NY}0}8}3}-1}5}2/9/2009}Let ma e tell you something. This Ramen joint has been making my belly happy way before Setagaya, Momofuku, Minca and the latest Ippudo. I f any Ramen fan out there hasn't been here then you should. No BS straight forward Ramen joint.You don't eat Ramen as if it's a full dinner, you go out eat and drink and then you get a quick bite. Ramen broth and the noodle will help prevent getting hangover. You don't need to pare a glass o sake with Ramen.This joint is like many Ramen place in Tokyo, if you don't like it fine. Midtown and East Vill is where you can find  good Ramen for less than $10.
Chelsea D.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}4}2/7/2009}I'm not exactly a ramen connoisseur, but I've had it at a few respectable places in SF, LA, and NY. The ramen here is probably the best I've had in NY, although I'll admit that I have yet to try Ippudo's. For the amount you're paying, though, the ramen at Rai Rai Ken is great. The noodles and toppings aren't exactly outstanding, but both very good, and the broth is much better than at most places I've tried. The restaurant itself is also notably small, but I've never found myself waiting very long for a seat.I've also had the gyoza here once or twice, and while it was good, it was nothing spectacular. Worth getting if you're still hungry after finishing your ramen, but nothing to go out of your way for.
Laurissa Y.}New York, NY}142}106}88}-1}3}1/17/2009}Good, but their broth is eons away from the orgasm that is Ippudo's. Granted, I'm not sure if the two should even be compared considering how different they are in atmosphere, decor, and price. That is not to say that I don't like the atmosphere, decor or price (I very much like the price in fact), but it just strives for a different crowd and dinner/late night experience. Tucked into a tiny little sliver of a space, Rai Rai Ken wants to be the affordable ramen shop you don't need to worship after every slurp, but it manages to be tasty in its own, simple, right. I tried two of the ramens here -- shoyu and miso. As expected, miso is definitely the heavyweight of the two ramens, but I found the flavor a little overpowering and salty, without much subtlety. It's a 1-2 punch KO kind of ramen.* Gyoza is also a popular order here, but I like my gyozas with a slightly burnt exterior to give it more texture. They were tasty, but slippery and glistening in its own grease.I would probably come back if I lived in the neighborhood, but it's not really a destination ramen shop -- at least, not in this city.* Disclaimer: I know nothing of boxing, but you get the point.
Rob P.}New York, NY}0}24}0}-1}4}1/16/2009}It's a tiny little shop, but I'll travel from midtown to get there. That's right: Rai Rai Ken is a destination noodle place.  The ramen dishes are great, made fresh right in front of you.  Don't miss the gyoza.
Loan T.}New York, NY}23}80}0}-1}5}1/8/2009}Rai Rai Ken gets five stars because they do Ramen pretty damn good and because they are so reasonably priced, I don't see why they aren't deserving of five stars.  I normally don't give five stars to places that take cash only, but man, this place is worth the money. You get a lot of bang for your buck, so I make it a point to always have enough cash to have RAMEN the way it should be had. ;)14 seats, not a lot, but this business knows what it's doing that it doesn't require a lot of square footage to make the bank it does.  Unlike momofuku, that place needs all the space it can get to make a decent buck.
Christina B.}New York, NY}0}8}0}-1}3}1/6/2009}I went here after reading some reviews most and people gave a 4, so I thought it must be good but it wasn't really that great.Going in, the atmosphere was like stepping into a an actual Japanese noodle bar, small space with seating right in front the kitchen and telling your order to the cook in your face (not really that close in your face, but it kinda seemed like it. haha)I ordered the Shoyu ramen, I did like the broth. It wasn't that salty as people have said here, also tried some of the Shio broth from a friend and I didn't find that salty either.  The pork was tender and went well with each sip of broth. The noodles itself was disappointing, tasted like those prepackaged egg curly noodles at least they didn't over cook them. My friend also ordered some gyoza, I got to try some and was disappointed with that too, only because it's the frozen Ajinomoto you can buy from any Asian supermarket. Those frozen gyoza have a distinct taste where you can tell its the packaged ones. I'm not saying it's bad to eat, but if wanted to the frozen ones I would just bought it from the market.So for a run down, the price, soup and pork were good. Noodles and gyoza were lackluster.  I would only go back maybe once in awhile... maybe.
Michael C.}New York, NY}5}16}0}-1}4}1/2/2009}The Ramen has taken a life of its own in NYC these days. Following Momofuku it feels like a ton of new Ramen places have opened up. Rai Rai Ken seems to have been a quiet (and honest) predecessor to this trend. You get these sense that they've just always been there, doing their thing. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Pure. I've had the Miso Ramen (with extra pork). It's simply delicious. (Although, I pick out ALL the garlic. There's a lot of it.)
tc h.}San Francisco, CA}10}90}0}-1}4}12/27/2008}we had the shoyu ramen and the miso ramen.  i hafta say that the noodles were one of the best i've had.  the toppings - pork - was meh.  the boiled egg was a nice touch.  the broth was alright, i've had better.  my shoyu broth was pretty light and i actually like it quite a bit that it wasn't too buttery and maybe that is what you get for less bad crap in your broth.  the store advertises no msg.  which i like.the service was prompt and great.  the staff was very polite and nice at 11pm at night.  they close at 2am, which is great.there is ramen, fried rice, fried noodles and 1-2 types of chilled noodles.  there is a special mabo ramen that i did not try -- i wasn't looking for anything heavy tonight.  the menu is simple and easy to understand and order.it is one star short of perfection, which is pretty damn good.
John T.}New York, NY}8}44}0}-1}4}12/23/2008}Ah, yes. Rai Rai Ken. Although I don't know exactly how authentic its ramen is, I do know what good food tastes like. Having a long counter, it is similar to ramen stands in Japan. For lack of a better word, it is "cozy." I have never taken it upon myself to count how many stools there are. But I wouldn't recommend going there with a party of 4. That would probably be 1/4th of the entire restaurant! Size aside, the noodle soup dishes at Rai Rai Ken is my standard for ramen. Perhaps that is unfair to other restaurants, but I can't imagine going out to eat ramen of lesser quality (though, I have to admit that eating instant ramen is one of my guilty pleasures). Any one of the ramen dishes are just as good as each have their own flavor. My favorite would have to be the curry ramen which only used to be served in October. Now, to my delight, it's a regular menu item.I have fond memories of eating here late at night, near 2 AM, while making small talk with the chef. Rai Rai Ken is one of those perfect places to go without having to worry about finding anyone to go with.
Sun M.}San Francisco, CA}11}85}0}-1}5}12/23/2008}I love this ramen place. Its super cheap and is super tasty.  Awesome for a hangover.
Eric L.}New York, NY}6}27}6}-1}5}12/20/2008}Some of the best ramen in NYC.
Helena F.}Brooklyn, NY}38}265}13}-1}3}12/11/2008}I came on a rainy day, high in sodium, but the curry ramen was tasty and only 8.50. This is definitely a nice casual staple to keep in mind for when you just want good bowl of noodles in a clean restaurant.
Dan S.}Princeton, NJ}74}89}0}-1}4}12/6/2008}So Ippudo and Momofuku are scenes with $16 ramen dinners.  I hear they are wonderful, but why deal with a 90 minute wait when this is around the corner.  Five ramen choices, my party tried three and they were the real deal.  Good gyoza.  Minus one star because we had to pay for kimchee and tea (but I'm spoiled by Ryowa).
Lisa M.}Brooklyn, NY}7}60}2}-1}4}11/24/2008}Really good noodle soup, although can be too salty at times.  Love the bamboo shoot side dish.  Writing this makes me wish I could go right now...
ThanOng S.}New York, NY}78}42}1}-1}4}11/18/2008}This small cozy place serves good ramen. I had shoyu ramen with extra pork. It was so good that I finished every drop of the soup!! ( or maybe i was just hungry..im not sure)Anyway, it was a good place. They offer the taste of real japanese ramen - like the one i had in Japan. And it is cheap! so why dont give this place a try? Oh be careful during the peak hour though..you mihgt have to wait because the place is very tiny small
Ingrid C.}San Francisco, CA}366}585}207}-1}4}11/17/2008}My favorite place for good, cheap ramen. No, it's not the best place ever, but it's about 1/2 the price! I love the weird, weird music they play, and the pork slices. Oh, the pork. And the late nights. I'd get off my late night shifts and they'd STILL be open. Hooray. Minus one star for recent changes: they crammed in a few additional stools (I totally understand, but it's SO cramped in the corner now), took away a pork slice, and raised their prices about 50 cents to a dollar. Damn you, New York City real estate prices!
Cindy T.}New York, NY}69}118}5}-1}4}11/8/2008}I stopped at this ramen restaurant on a whim when I first moved to the East Village. It's quickly become my favorite place to grab an inexpensive, quick meal on my way home. I love the place because it reminds me of my experiences in Japan -- one of my favorite places in the world. When you walk through the draped doors of Rai Rai Ken, you are magically transported to Japan.The restaurant is merely a bar (no tables). It's small, but has a very charming atmosphere. I've had the ramen and soba at Rai Rai Ken. Both were delicious and satisfying. Most of the items on the menu contain meat (specifically, pork), but they will happily prepare anything vegetarian if you request so. Also, you will be more satisfied with your food if you tell the waiter how you like your food. Don't be afraid to say, "I like a lot of vegetables" or "I like it spicy." Don't forget to have a Japanese beer with your meal!
Cody C.}Hoboken, NJ}0}18}0}-1}3}11/1/2008}The ramen here was pretty good and cheap, but not the best. There wasn't a line when we went, it was around mid-afternoon. Restaurant is very tiny, really just a bar with stools. Menchanko Tei and Ippudo have much tastier ramen.
Amanda P.}Brooklyn, NY}0}10}0}-1}3}10/22/2008}I really like this place.  Good, cheap, fast food.  Good service and interesting  atmosphere.  Good for vegetarian too.
Ernie K.}Dallas, TX}267}487}66}-1}3}10/22/2008}I wanted to try this place last time but the line was so mighty long.  Thinking it has to be good for people to wait over 30 minutes to get in, I left work little early to eat there and eh, it was alright.  I think Momofuku, Sapporo and Ramen Setagaya definitely have better ramen than them.I wouldn't mind going there again but it's not a joint I would strongly recommend.
Andrew C.}New York, NY}4}8}0}-1}4}10/17/2008}One word comes to mind with Rai Rai Ken - Solid. Definitely not fancy or sceney just Quick, cheap and tasty.
James H.}New York, NY}395}119}4}-1}3}10/15/2008}Somewhere been Okay and decent... I like the feel of this place... the hole in the wall, bar only seating with open kitchen. Everything but the Mexican workers preparing my Japanese Ramen... hmm. Anyways, I got the Miso ramen, which tasted like miso... which didn't taste that well. Friend got the Shio ramen, which she said was decent, but not great. I heard good and bad things, so again it was somewhere in the middle...
Katsu D.}Manhattan, NY}13}153}7}-1}1}10/11/2008}This was the first "ramen" place I went to in NYC about 2 years ago and afterwards I was in so much intestinal pain I had to stop at a Duane Reed and buy Pepto. Never came back since  x_x;
JP M.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}11}72}0}-1}3}10/10/2008}The food is decent, cheaper than most of the East Village ramen shops, and authentic.  That said, with all of the ramen competition over the last few years, it's fallen on my list of preferred East Village ramen shops.  I'll pay the little bit more money to go to one of the better ones.
Grant C.}New York, NY}95}446}205}-1}2}10/9/2008}Color me unimpressed.  The ramen here wasn't bad, but pretty bland.  Tiny little place with just one counter.  Alright if you're in the neighborhood or alone, but there are better places to go.
Denis S.}Marina del Rey, CA}716}1967}21}18}3}10/7/2008}We got delivery from this place.  It was OK, and it wasn't that expensive (though $5 for 6 gyoza isn't that cheap), but it wasn't too bad.  But the quality wasn't that great either.  So this place is fine for takeout, but nothing worth craving.
Michael D.}New York, NY}78}185}1}-1}4}9/30/2008}If the painting "Nighthawks at the Diner"  faculty.evansville.edu/r… had been painted by Hiroshige w00.middlebury.edu/ID085…    instead of Edward Hopper,  nga.gov/exhibitions/2007… it would look like this restaurant.
Daniel K.}Brooklyn, NY}28}485}6}-1}4}9/24/2008}i've never been to japan but this is what i imagine.  feels like this place could be found off an alley.  good prices great atmosphere.    ramen is ok, as new spots have taken over the taste war. still will come here from time to time when its cold out and i want to feel like im japan.
Michael M.}New York, NY}171}130}5}-1}4}9/23/2008}Best noodles of any NY ramenya. The Shio Ramen is the order of choice - be sure to request 'extra butter'. The pork cha-han is delicious, particularly if you throw on a lot of extra pepper. Very authentic feel, reminds me of Japan.
Krishnan S.}San Francisco, CA}3}70}9}-1}4}9/12/2008}One of my standard places to go in the east village - there is nothing like a hot bowl of ramen on a cold winter day. That being said, there are a total of 14 seats available along the bar and the one table that they have making it very crowded and there is always a queue outside. Maybe the wait outside makes the ramen taste all the better? The tiny size of the place may add to its charm but can be a little annoying.The ramen is good, there are only four different choices but they are all tasty. They also have several side dishes such as pork fried rice which I would recommend.
Miriam W.}San Francisco, CA}3141}3141}2255}18}3}8/30/2008}Ramen was just okay.Pork fried rice, on the other hand, was really good!As for the kimchi, I should've known better than to order it anywhere outside of a Korean restaurant.
Michelle C.}Brooklyn, NY}33}95}0}-1}3}8/21/2008}Rai Rai Ken is one of the original ramen places in the East Village  - long before Momofuku, Ippudo or Ramen Sategaya came to infect Manhattanites with Ramen Fever. It's on a class of it's own albeit a lower class but you appreciate it for what it is. No frills, no attitude, no scene, no empty wallets right after. You won't get home made noodles here or farmer's market organic ingredients or celebrity chefs. All you'll get is just good old working class ramen and sometimes that's all you need.(Order any of the ramen bowls - they're equally yumm. Definitely try all the add ons. Curry, fried rice and gyoza are good too if you're not in a ramen mood)
AJ K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}28}0}-1}3}8/7/2008}So I had very high expectations for Rai Rai ken, not only because of the hype on yelp, but also because of some friends who had been trying to drag me there after I told them how much I liked Ramen Setagaya. They swore I'd think Setagaya was nothing after this. Well, they were wrong. And oh how wrong they were. Let's start with first impressions - nice cozy space, counter only, with full view of the food preparation. Nice. Hostess was friendly and helped move some people around to fit our 6 person group. Score one for Rai Rai Ken.Moving on to real impressions - Oolong Iced tea was awesome, score two for Rai Rai ken. Unfortunately that's where the upside ends. The kitchen staff that night only had one asian chef, and that seemed a little off for what was advertised to me as an asian Ramen spot. I knew right away this was preparation with a formula which would not be perfectly executed, and unfortunately I was right. My Ramen dish, a seasonal preparation, was a mess of goopy brown slop on top of a plate of Ramen. I could distinguish shitake mushrooms and maybe hearts of palm? And the rest was, well, I don't know. It didn't taste bad at all, but the only strength was the Shitake Mushroom flavor. The dish was too salty, and came with almost no pork. Extra pork = Extra charge. Not good. Then I tried my friend's more traditional ramen soup. Same noodles from the microwave packages. Am I wrong to say that is not the real deal? I always thought traditional ramen used wider noodles. Anyway, it was way too salty and not that well flavored. And again, not much pork, and not the good fatty kind. And what is up with no sake? Beer only? Blah.Honestly, I don't know what all the hype is about, this is an ok spot, but I felt it was too expensive, underwhelming, and an overall disappointment. Had I not come with expectations it might have been better, which is why I let them get away with 3 stars instead of the 2 I was originally going with. I didn't think they screwed anything up so bad that it was a bad spot, so I wouldn't feel right giving them less. The problem is that I can't tell what they are going for, so I can't really say they don't hit their mark. Rai Rai ken just didn't strike me as special, and the place lacks the niceties of simliar ramen spots in the surrounding area. That said, it was not bad, its open late, and it is worth a try.
Kage Y.}Yonkers, NY}99}33}12}-1}4}8/1/2008}What's the best part about this place? It's open late at night and it has a simple menu. This ramen place reminds me of those old ramen carts you see everywhere in Japan. They're really friendly there and you can strike up conversation with fellow ramen lovers at all odd hours at night. I've tried almost everything they have, miso, shisho etc etc. I'm not a big fan of bamboo in my food so I usually ask not to have it in my ramen. And when I have cravings for beef curry over rice I come here. Overall a really nice place for a quick meal and convo, especially in the winter time. It can get packed (which doesn't take long.) However luckily ramen's usually a quick meal. So seating is always available. Do not expect to bring a party here. (Not happening.)
john l.}Minneapolis, MN}49}22}0}-1}3}7/31/2008}Another place I visited during my lunch break was Rai Rai Ken. Like Otafuku it is hidden on a little street and has a great atmosphere to it. People who like this kind of food will love it here. The prices kind of disappointed me.So all in all if you like this kind of food and have a craving for it coming to Rai Rai Ken isnt bad. But its also not the greatest.
Gracie-C Y.}San Francisco, CA}76}308}2}-1}3}7/24/2008}Heard a lot about Rai Rai Ken through the grapevine.You crazy Yelpers seem to mention it often too...Since wifey and I are always in the mood for ramen, we decided to give this place a whirl.Pros:- Small (preposterously tiny) and intimate, just the way I like my ramen joints.- Simple menu, ain't much else but ramen.- Decent noodles.Cons:- For nine bucks, where the hell is my pork??  What?  You want $3 more for pork... getdafuckouttahere!- The broth base seemed a bit bland, they seemed to favor chicken as a base.My first ramen disappointment in a long while... *sniff*
Jenny B.}San Jose, CA}20}327}0}-1}3}7/15/2008}got the shiso to go. don't think the travel time really hurt the flavor of the noodles, but nevertheless, only will give it 3 stars. the broth is just so-so, nothing wrong with it, just a bit salty.meat is definitely too chewy and not tender. toppings are ok.overall not too special, but decent.
F N.}Brooklyn, NY}7}87}0}-1}4}7/13/2008}Really really tasty ramen!  Got the summer item called Hiyashi (probably misspelled that).  Cold ramen with a tangy sauce that included all these yummy irresistible items!  VERY cramp but rather cozy place . . . .
Renee C.}New York, NY}42}175}0}-1}2}7/9/2008}alright, i'm apologizing in advance to all of you rai rai ken lovers out there, but i have to be honest...i've had much better.  the only reason i got rai rai ken was because my normal ramen place (minca ramen) doesn't deliver and i was feeling much too lazy to walk the 3 blocks to pick it up.  my bad.  i got the shoyu ramen and the yakisoba, both of which were just okay, not great by any means.  i think i'll be sticking to my minca ramen factory from now on.
Patricia M.}New York, NY}29}39}10}-1}4}7/6/2008}I'm so glad Rai Rai Ken is in my neighborhood!  Their ramen is oh so delicious. The service is fast and friendly.  The place is small and cozy but I always find an open sit.  I highly recommend it just remember it's cash only!
Carl C.}Brooklyn, NY}25}153}3}-1}4}6/27/2008}I liked the miso ramen. Noodles had the right bite to them and the broth had the right miso balance. Not sure about the cabbage in it (never remember having that before) but it was an interesting touch. The Chashu and Gyoza were excellent when I was there, shame to think they would be inconsistent.Cool decor, sit at the narrow bar, order up some ramen and enjoy. I mean the place is laid out like a ramen place should be. Not too much room. Not a place to sit and talk and have a loooooong meal. A place to order, eat, and leave.
ben -.}New York, NY}17}101}0}-1}5}6/26/2008}Adorable cave-like, red-walled counter seat only ramen joint. It's adorable and cozy inside. I didn't have any trouble finding a seat, but imagine it'd be a pain to wait in there. I had the shoyu ramen and it was incredible. The noodles were delicious (I got a refill, they weren't as good as the first batch). The pork is a little tough and not as buttery with fat as you'll find at ramen setagaya or momofuku, but still delicious. The soup base and noodles really seal the deal. For about $10, you betcha I'll be heading back.
Yaahmee T.}San Francisco, CA}9}65}0}-1}5}6/17/2008}Mmmmm hmmmm......I lub ramen. This place knows what hot ramen noodle soup is about on a frigid cold day.  This place knows that ramen does not need to be served in no fancy dancy atmosphere filled with no fancy dancy people.  This place knows to serve it simple and to the point.  The End.Did I mention I lub ramen?
Ting Ting L.}San Francisco, CA}18}43}0}-1}4}6/16/2008}Cute hole-in-the-wall in East Village - very fast service, very few things on the menu.The first time I went, I tried the beef curry and my friend had the soysauce ramen. Both were quite delicious. The second time, I tried the zha-jiang mian and was disappointed. The noodles were bland and the flavors were not authentic.Overall, a good eatery given the price.
Aki A.}Brooklyn, NY}42}66}0}-1}5}6/13/2008}I'm not one to wait for noodles. But I went into the city early just to try this place out a while ago and I wanted my ramen! I waited a few minutes to get a seat for some yummy goodness. And I'd do it again.Their ramen is great! It's kinda tough to choose which one I like more, this place or Setagaya. I think there are certain things I liked here and certain things that I liked at Setagaya. I can't pinpoint what though. So I will have to eat at them again, several times until I figure it out :)Oh, and it's cheap!
Maria C.}New York, NY}19}146}1}-1}4}6/9/2008}My favorite ramen place in the city.  It has its pluses and minuses, but overall I give it a plus!  There is nothing better than, on a cold winter day, trekking over to the E. Village for a piping hot bowl of salty, somewhat oily (but not too oily) ramen.  My personal favorite is the miso ramen.  Enough little veggies in th soup to make you feel somewhat healthy.  Nice and salty and cozy.  Love it.  P.s. Word on the street is that they make their ramen noodles fresh (same owners as soba-ya or so I hear).
Jack T.}Sunnyvale, CA}66}260}121}18}5}6/1/2008}Cheap, hole-in-the wall, authentic Japanese Ramen joint.Loved it! Good price, low frills but real satisfying noodles. I like places like this but can understand why others might not. It's tiny, the workers are scrambling and it's not meant to be luxurious but convenient and quick instead.The tastes of the broth is what makes this place original. It's uniquely Japanese treat that tastes especially good when chilly.
Nya K.}New York, NY}1}11}0}-1}4}5/31/2008}All of these years I had no idea what real ramen was like. Hell I  didn't even know there was such a thing shio ramen. This is my favorite place for ramen. The noodles are alway perfectly cooked. It's fast, msg free and cozy.
H T.}Manhattan, NY}16}7}0}-1}3}5/18/2008}rai rai ken...ah, memories.  i feel that there've since been better ramen places to make their way into e.vil, but rai rai is still a good little joint.
Jo K.}New York, NY}267}494}313}18}3}5/16/2008}Get the miso ramen, it has fried garlic bits on top and the soup is thick and yummy! the fried rice wasn't bad as well!! i like coming here alone on a rainy day and it's not a place you want to come with a group of people! it's super tiny, maybe seats 10 at a time!
Katie S.}New York, NY}7}15}0}-1}5}5/13/2008}don't want to beat a dead horse here, but i wanted to drive this rating up with a 5.  I used to have another favorite noodle soup place in the village that made me feel like I was really in Japan. You've been unseated, place.Rai Rai has perfectly cooked noodles, the pork is actually tender, the special seafood broth is outstanding. New favorite!!!
Laura B.}Manhattan, NY}11}18}0}-1}4}5/8/2008}I love ramen, even crappy $.29 ramen. But this isn't that. This is the real deal like what you'd find in Japan. Big noodles and lots of fixings, including meat, fish, and vegetable, in a huge bowl. You eat the noodles and fixings first. The broth keeps them warm. And the best part is: tons of food for dirt cheap! Of all the noodle shops in the city, this is consistently the best and the one I make special trips to go to.  Just beware the line out the door.  The earlier you get there the better.
Ken P.}New York, NY}51}17}2}-1}4}4/29/2008}went for the 2nd time last night looking for someplace fast me and my friend could get a good meal b4 catching a flick!  i had been craving rai rai ken for a while so I was more than happy to make this suggestion for a fast, cheap and YUMMY!!  i got the curry ramen and my friend got the house special.  it was a cold wet rainy night so it hit the spot.  i think the ramen was pretty good, nothing amazing but it was good for what it was and cheap, each of us paid $12 including a beer.....
Sally D.}East District, Taiwan}5}17}0}-1}2}4/28/2008}mediocre and definitely salty. maybe it was the time of day or some other variable, but not good. it's ok if you're craving ramen and you have no other options.
Ellen C.}Oakland, CA}150}725}23}18}4}4/28/2008}On my second visit there I finally got in the door. The first time there was about a 40 minute wait and I was too hungry to wait, so I headed down a block or two to Momofuku's. Let me tell you though if you are looking for ramen then you should definitely stay here at Rai Rai Ken. Momofuku doesn't even come close to comparing. We got the curry ramen & the seafood fried rice. Both were exceptional. Unlike the other ramen eateries I had visited in the last week the soup for the curry ramen wasn't salty -- instead it was flavorful and light. The noodles were cooked to perfection -- chewy and tender all at the same time. The fried rice, though nothing new or spectacular about it was cooked just right. The rice was succulent and fragrant and the ingredients were pretty good.This bowl of food also made me fuller than any of the other stores for the same price. As a plus everyone's so friendly there! Just beware that if you want a seat try getting there for lunch or early for dinner. Otherwise you may just be caught in a very long line. Bon appetit!
Josh E.}Seattle, WA}104}201}25}-1}3}4/26/2008}Kind of like going into a slaughterhouse with the red walls. Nice on a cold winter night with the deep red, tight fit, and exposed kitchen (which bathes the walls and windows in steamy condensation from the boiling pots). Decent ramen. The noodles were fine on my visits. Better than Momofuku for sure. Sapporo was the better of the 3 on my one visit there.
edgar l.}New York, NY}0}16}0}-1}1}4/3/2008}The story with Rai-Rai Ken is that the owners simply didn't care anymore.  When they first opened, there were real japanese people working there and pride themselves of the food they offered to their customers. I used to enjoy their gyoza (made with a special gyoza fryer/steamer) and their charsui ramen.Then suddenly one day, the place was replaced with mexican workers and the only japanese person was there to collect the money. There is nothing wrong with using mexican people to cook your food, but the idea that this is suppose to be a japanese ramen place and not seeing any japanese people working there make the place less authentic. The food drastically changed as well. The charsui is dry, the broth is water downed, and the noodles are just ok.I think it's time for new management to revamp this place and give it a new menu. Don't waste your time going here for ramen, you have much better time next door at shabu-shabu instead.
Cecilia C.}New York, NY}0}132}6}-1}4}3/29/2008}Found this place on Zagat, and both my husband and I love it.  We live in uptown, but we're always willing to make the trip to Rai Rai Ken!  The broth, as many have pointed out, is a bit salty.  (But hey, I've found most ramen in NYC salty anyway! ).  Portions are not too big, so you might want to order some other food.  My husband love the fried rice, and again, it's on the salty side.  Last time we asked them to make it less salty and it turned out to be great.  I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because the gyoza was a bit of a dissapointed.  Heading there tonight!  Can't wait!
Suburban R.}Manhattan, NY}14}137}688}-1}3}3/22/2008}if tampopo were to be re-filmed and set in the US, it would be shot here. great ramen-- rich broth, al dente egg noodle, scallions, pork belly toppings...
Lynn W.}New York, NY}110}168}69}-1}4}3/16/2008}Good lil hole in the wall ramen place. Good price, big portion, the wait can be quite long at times though.
Sharlene C.}Brooklyn, NY}73}668}84}-1}4}3/14/2008}this tiny store front can seat maybe 15 people around the ramen bar.  most customers eat and run.  no dilly dallying.  ramen comes out quickly and steaming.  just how i like it.  i got the shoyu ramen without pork.  the soup was real salty but so is setagaya's.  it's cheap and favorful.  that's good enough for me.  plus, the customers are friendly.  the gentleman sitting next to me sported a hello kitty wallet.  AWESOME!ramen and sapparo for $12.  bargain!
Michael L.}New York, NY}53}189}0}-1}3}3/9/2008}I love the hole-in-the-wall ambiance of Rai Rai Ken, really makes you feel like you're in the know about a really authentic Japanese ramen place.  Unfortunately though, I think the ramen is just okay.  It satisfies a craving for hot ramen noodle soup, but that's about it.It's a little bit apples to oranges because they're very different styles of ramen, but I much prefer Setagaya around the corner.
John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}2}3/7/2008}A fun and interesting place from a decor perspective but if you fancy authentic Japanese ramen you will not be happy.  This is Americanized ramen that despite its many flaws it does deliver flavor.  On my most recent visit my noodles were so badly overcooked that I thought I was back at Momofuku having his terrible ramen.  The preparation of the ingredients in the bowl won't make you think you are in Japan as they include foreign items including cabbage and onions.  The gyoza was a disaster on my last visit - easily the worst I've ever had.  Wowfully undercooked dumplings and an awful accompanying sauce.  For all my complaining I am happy to say that at least this place is cheap.
Linda J.}Brooklyn, NY}10}44}2}-1}4}2/25/2008}TASTY!  I always get the shoyu ramen, gyoza, and the seafood fried rice.  Do not be alarmed, I share it with a friend.  I am no ramen connoisseur but I have had ramen at several other places in the city, and since the unfortunate closing of Chikibu in midtown, RaiRai Ken has become my favorite spot for it.  Also love the small bar-like setup.  It's always warm, bustling, and full of happy, slurping people hovering over large bowls of steaming ramen noodles.
Susan A.}Brooklyn, NY}118}614}1}18}4}2/22/2008}I've been here twice, and sad to say, I've never had their ramen.  However, their Beef Curry dish always has me coming back time and time again...  a cross between beef stroganoff and chinese curried beef, this amazing beef/veggie/rice dish brings me back to the days of old, the younger years of when my mom had time to cook me lunch, the kitchen table, I digress.So yes, I am a big fan of this dish.  The edamame was good -- I never would have thought to mix suger with the salt -- but it brings out the goodness of edamame.  A little salty for my tastes, but hey, it's edamame!  Eating the salt is not a requirement.  =)The almond tofu dessert was also made well.  Not breathtakingly spantastic, but healthy.  Better than some other places I've been to, but not as good as other rare occassions. Seating is annoying, and for some reason, both times I went, the sky really let them dogs and cats loose!  (POURING!)  It's bar-style seating, so don't expect to be able to see all your friends if you go with more than one person.  Also narrow hallway that goes behind you that leads to the bathroom, so expect traffic.  However, given the small span of space they have, they've done well and there isn't anything lacking in terms of decor.  Although a picture here and there might liven up the back wall a little.  Then again, it would be bad if it fell on some as they ate or walked to the bathroom.
Eric P.}New York, NY}2}2}0}-1}2}2/19/2008}The food is as appealing as the decor.  They're both uninteresting at best.The place is dingy and the ramen is so-so.If you go there haven't read any of the rave reviews; you'd think the ramen is ok.  Otherwise, you'll be very disappointed
Jeff O.}Jackson Heights, NY}468}1294}216}-1}4}2/17/2008}The walls and the styling make it seem real. I almost caught myself saying that this is a REAL ramen noodle place to my friend... but cmon, the walls look 400 years old, but I doubt Washington and his cohorts were chillin here back in the day.  Soon after we sat down, the walls became people waiting for a seat. The other diners seemed to notice and either they felt rushed or the staff provoked them to. That being said, it's comfortable, fun, and the focus is the meal - because straight in front of you is another short wall. The focus  on the food is good for the head.
Thanh N.}New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}2/16/2008}We stumbled upon Rai Ken Ken while looking for Sapporo East for a bowl of ramen. The place is small and cozy, giving the impression of an authentic noodle shop like those from "Tampopo". The food, unfortunately, was a huge disappointment. We tried gyoza for appetizer and shoyu and shio ramen. The gyoza was pathetic, soggy and tasteless. The noodles were starchy, the soup base was lacking, and the overall experience was underwhelming. It tastes more like Chinese than Japanese food (we even noticed that the scallions were chopped coarsely Chinese style, unlike the super-thin Japanese style). On a positive note, we're happy with the quick and courteous service. We won't go back but rather will continue our quest for a perfect bowl of ramen in the city. We've been to several places including Men Kui Tei, Menchanko Tei, Sapporo, and Mitsuwa market, and our vote goes to Men Kui Tei in W 56 St (we're not impressed by the St. Marks location).
Elijah C.}New Orleans, LA}21}199}18}-1}3}2/5/2008}not a bad bowl of ramen. this isn't my favorite place (setagaya is), but i've had a nice hot bowl of soup there before. like another reviewer said this place missed the mark for me. the egg was hard, the pork was dry and there just wasn't anything that special about it. i would go here before mcdonalds 1 million times out of 10, but i probably won't be rushing back anytime too soon.
David Z.}New York, NY}4}11}0}-1}4}2/4/2008}I love this place! There is nothing better on a cold day to warm you up than squeezing into this narrow noodle bar and taking a seat at one of the 14 stools that line the bar. Watching the 3 cooks equally squeeze past one another and keep everyone happy is fun to watch. The Miso Ramen is my go to noodle soup with crispy garlic, chicken, bean sprouts, onion, and scallions. I usually get a side if kimchi or gyzoa which are both well done. I always feel perfectly satisfied when squeeze one last time past all the jackets hanging on the wall and make my way to 2nd ave.
Greg K.}New York, NY}1}19}0}-1}3}2/2/2008}This place wasn't too bad.  I had the shoyu ramen to kind of gauge the place, and it was average.  The soup had a shallow taste: I could recognize the shoyu-ness, but it lacked depth.  Noodles seemed fine, a little stingy on the pork (one small slice).  And I do believe this is the first time I've seen spinach in ramen, though you have to get your vegetables somewhere, so I'm not complaining.
Daphne H.}San Francisco, CA}78}444}18}-1}3}2/1/2008}Ramen craving. Torrential downpour.A hot bowl of shoyu ramen. Yum.I'm still a sucker for my go-to ramen shop in Vancouver, BC but Rai Rai Ken isn't too bad :DIts a tiny place and a bowl goes for less than $10. The Shoyu broth was pretty authentic too. The lady next to me was having the curry ramen which smelt pretty good too :P
Joolie T.}Brooklyn, NY}1083}1296}1020}-1}3}1/31/2008}i want to love this place. "it's the best ramen in NYC!"yeah, sure. with NY'ers... i never seem to believe anyone. seriously. one too many times, i've listened to natives and NON-ASIAN peoples about where to go for authentic ramen. uh- i've been asking the wrong people. NY'ers in GENERAL. even my Asian buddies steer me in horrible destinations--- leaving me dissatisfied and almost pissed off. i mean, what the hell are these people raving about? bland soup?i know all you guys hate MSG... but here's a secret- Asians LOVE MSG, foo. recognize. furthermore, when you think of ramen... do you really imagine it without preservatives, msg, etc.? give me a break. also, i am used to thinner and less starchy noodles- again, Rai Rai missed the mark for me. the portion is actually pretty lacking. lots of broth, some noodle... but where's all the goodies? the fishcake, veggies, egg, etc.? after a few chat n chews later... all you're left with is mediocre noodle in soup. boring! the space is so small you don't even know where to put your Chloe Paddington Purse. i put mine on my lap the whole time. geez!!!p.s. the gyozas were ick!
Chris H.}San Jose, CA}43}89}7}-1}4}1/28/2008}3/25/08 Update:Apparently, they open only until 2am now, and only on the weekends (or was it always like this??).  I had some ramen there recently and it was quite disappointing - noodles overcooked and soggy, broth bland and thin, other ingredients (eggs, pork) sparse.  I'll reduce it one star for now, maybe more if it keeps up like this.-----------------Rai Rai is not the best ramen place in the city, but it's probably my overall favorite.  The all-natural (no MSG) ramen is not as tasty as Ramen Setagaya, which I feel has the most nuanced, complex taste of the 4 or 5 ramen places I visited, nor is the broth of its noodles as dense as Momofuku's, but it's definitely close on both those counts.   What pushes Rai Rai above those two into the top slot of my shortlist of ramen joints is its competence in the forementioned two areas combined with it's closing time of 3am, perfect for late night snacking after a crazy night out (which is usually when ramen should be served anyway), the availability of Kirin, probably my favorite of the three Japanese brews, for continued drunken craziness, and a more varied menu that contains different dishes as opposed to different versions of the same thing (such as Jajangmein, for example, not just different versions of shio or pork ramen).   The servers are always friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy and lively, with customers seated closely together at barstools, lined up down the narrow, cavelike hallway of a room, busily slurping their bowls of steaming hot noodles.  Definitely a must-visit after a night of drinks.
P S.}Oakland, CA}8}48}4}-1}3}1/22/2008}Went there for a second time last night and I must say I wasn't as pleased as the first time around. I love the atmosphere and the way it feels like an authentic noodle bar in Japan. But When I saw my soy sauce based ramen noodles coming out of a plastic baggie it felt like I was just getting some 50 cent top ramen from a supermarket.I love the big portions but I just didn't want to finish it half way through even though I was still hungry. Not bad, just not great. Also, it was so damn cramped! We were trying to save a seat for our friend on her way and had to fight off at least 3 groups of people who all hated us. And having people hover over you waiting for you to finish isn't too fun either.Next time i'll try the curry. Maybe I just wasn't in a ramen mood. Oh, but the staff is real nice and attentive on the plus side.
Jeannie C.}San Francisco, CA}35}130}6}-1}5}1/7/2008}Oh what joy Rai Rai Ken brings when all you want is a hot bowl of savory ramen. I love each kind of ramen but gravitate towards the Miso and Curry ones. The gyoza is tasty and I always get some Kimchee too. Affordable, delicious, authentic, low brau. Everything tastes fantastic.
Tront W.}Brooklyn, NY}17}50}19}-1}4}12/18/2007}Here we go, nice quantity.  This is a huge bowl with lots of different ingredients and flavors in there at once.  It's really tight though and if there are people waiting (probably) the waiters / cookers will give you the evil "elbow eye" (just made that up get it???).  You can really get full on a bowl which is semi-vegan at least.  Get that big ol' ramen miso shit without chicken, it's $7.25 or something.  Really good.  I wish there were pitchers here but instead no, only $4 beers.  Also good for celebrity finding!!!  I just saw an Animal Collective guy in there!!  He was wearing a poncho or something (go figure), the tall blondey one.  With Other Music Scott Mou.  They are also in Jane.  Maybe they were talking about music.  PROBABLY right?!?!
Maritess Z.}Seattle, WA}598}281}9}-1}5}12/4/2007}I LOVE Rai Rai ken. Went here with my beloved gay husband David S. We had cold noodles because it was a hot summer night. OMG. Ecstacy, I never expected cold noodles to taste so complicated and delicate yet not over or undercooked. It really was heaven. I want to come back and try their ramen which if it is anything like their cold noodles will be nirvana.
R O.}New York, NY}94}224}4}-1}4}11/9/2007}Rai Rai Ken has ZERO atmosphere, so don't come here on a first date...but their ramen is so comforting, filling, and good.  I order the Miso Ramen.  The service is quick.  The seating is small and cramped.  The place isn't made for comfort; it's made for good ramen!  And they deliver..!
M K ..}New York, NY}18}37}17}-1}5}10/27/2007}She was sucking and slurping up the noddles like there was no end. Rai Rai Ken is a really cool, cute unusual hole in the wall that serves delicious ramen style dishes. I was introduced to this place by some of my hardcore korean friends that enjoy the taste of ramen dishes with kimchi. My first reaction honestly was lets get out of here or i'll just eat something latter, geessszus. When I was served my dish my thoughts were, "where is the seafood and how do I eat this crap". I couldn't understand it at first until I found myself sucking up da noddles and making lots of slurping sounds while devouring the dish with no space for conversation in between. It was refreshing. My only criticism would be the kimchi side dish. I wish it was fermented and more spicy.The space sits only 15 people the most on a long bar counter, so one may have to wait about 10 minutes for a space to open up I ordered the Shio Ramen house special seafood based noodle soup topped with bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed, and scallion.Bon Appetit................
Yosh H.}New York, NY}246}399}77}-1}4}10/26/2007}When it's dark, damp and cold.  When you see a storm coming and then have lighting part the skies, thou shall have no fear!  For there is no better time to take that hour lunch and go to Rai Rai Ken for a hot bowl of ramen!  Conveniently located in the East Village, this small restaurant consists of a counter of approximately 10 seats and an additional two next to the front window.  That's it!  But don't fret if you can't find a seat, the turnover rate is pretty darn good.  Although there are some additional items on the menu, there are really only three types of ramen to choose from.  - Shoyu Ramen (soy sauce based noodle soup topped with bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed, and scallion);- Shio Ramen (house special seafood based noodle soup topped with bamboo shoot, boiled egg, roast pork, spinach, fish cake, dry seaweed, and scallion) and, - Miso Ramen (soybean based noodle soup topped with bean sprouts, cabbage, onion, crispy garlic, chicken, and scallionsToday, I tried the Miso Ramen which came comes piping hot and ready to be properly consumed.  Again, a bit too salty for my palate but good nonetheless.  And although you leave $8 lighter, you leave warm, happy, and fully nourished for another few hours in your cubicle.  Which only makes you ask, "Maybe I should have gotten two bowls."Be forewarned!  The restaurant is dingy but that's because it's really all about the noodles.
Keith B.}Concord, NC}4}82}2}-1}4}10/23/2007}Yup the 57 other reviews are right - it is good!  It has the feel of a Tokyo Ramen shop, much more so than the other places I've been in NYC.  The curry ramen and the gyoza were both very good.
Mr. Met s.}Stony Brook, NY}78}346}513}-1}5}10/14/2007}Wow! From first glance on the sidewalk, your perception seems to dictate a run down of a mill, cramped, dirty small restaurant. But, please do yourself a favor - go in and sit down!You will be serviced by the finest soup base/ramen broth ever made! Their broth/soup base is just unbelievable and is accompanied by average ramen noodles. I'm telling you, when you first place the cozy warm noodles in your mouth with your chopsticks - make sure to hold your soup spoon with some broth in it  and drink it! *If you look over the counter, you can see their soup base is comprised of many delicious components that make it sooooo good. Just glance over! I also noticed many customers taking pictures of the huge soup pot. I guess they want to know the secret behind the broth!*Also, their NO MSG reputation is true. Just try the broth, there is no artificial preservatives. I once drank the whole bowl.......I must say, their ramen noodles is of average quality - something you can find in supermarkets - but the soup/broth more than replaces that feeling. I do wished they had more variety - they only have 5 ramen bowls - a very limited choice and very easy to get bored of. Their yakisoba is average and not recommendedTheir vegatables dish is above average and recommendedTheir dumplings are below average - very soft and expensive for 6 pieces.(5 dollars)I haven't tried the rest on the menu yet. Their menu is small about 12-15 items including appetizers.Overall, their price is decent (about 6-7 dollars per ramen bowl)The restaurant is very very small, in fact there are no tables, but a sushi bar type. There are only 10 chairs and when packed, you will be sitting elbow to elbow, chopsticks to chopsticksI must say, I give RaiRai Ken five stars because of their broth. Try it, you won't regret it!Remember...broth, broth, broth
XSX X.}Jersey City, NJ}2}3}0}-1}5}10/9/2007}I love this place. It's really small, you sit at the 'bar' and they serve a handful of types of ramen. The ramen is really tasty, and it's only about $6-8 bucks each. And it sounds silly but I love the way they did their bathroom ... it's so small but they made it look larger and funky by putting small colored mirrors all over the walls at different angles.
Andy L.}Forest Hills, NY}65}23}9}-1}4}10/7/2007}Full disclosure: I am in no way an expert on Japanese ramen. However, I've had enough ramen around NYC to consider Rairaiken as the gold standard....for now. I love how the whole place is LITERALLY a hole in the wall, in the traditional Japanese style. There's about a total of 12 seats in the whole place, 10 of them at the counter where the cooks place your steaming bowls of ramen in front of you, immediately after cooking. Definitely not a place for groups, but definitely a place for slurpers. If you don't know how to slurp noodles while you eat, go somewhere else.Any of the 3 ramens (shoyu, shio, miso) are quite delish. I also always order a side of Menma (marinated bamboo shoots, seaweed, scallion, red pepper mix, and soy sauce). However, the gyoza are nothing to write home about. Must remember to try the beef curry one day, but I can't imagine it to be that great.Oh yeah, no cute wait staff to write about. I've got no comment on the Hispanic cooks. Unless you're into the Latin flava. haha
Melissa C.}New York, NY}3}40}2}-1}5}9/29/2007}Cheap, quick, no frills ramen - the way its supposed to be. In this grand city we live in, I'm sure that there are several places that have/have tried to transform ramen into some gourmet dish (maybe by claiming they get their ramen from a special ramen-making monastery from some special ramen mountain in Japan; or perhaps by shaking things up by turning it into some fusion ramen dish with fennel and sage and aged berkshire pork), but Rai Rai Ken will have none of that. Three kinds of soup bases (miso, shio, and shoyu) and the same good chewy ramen in each. You sit, the guys behind the counter set down your bowl, you gobble, and you leave with a full and satisfied tummy. And that's all there is to it.
Arthur O.}Greenwich Village, New York, NY}186}446}316}-1}5}9/24/2007}I'll hit up Rai Rai Ken anytime.  Especially after a night of drinking.The guys that work there are friendly and serve up some real tasty food.  No pretense, no gimmicks, just delicious and greasy food for your (mostly) alc-induced hunger.Try the Pork.  It's the best and the most fresh pork I've had in NY.  Also, get other stuff with pork in it.  Tender and flavorful.  Definitely opt for the Ramen as opposed to Yakisoba (although, if you end up going back for more and often like I do, you'll have to eventually try everything they offer).  Forget about the Cold Jajangmein.  It wasn't that great.  Get the side order of Kimchi.  It'll be nice and refreshing to go with all the greasy stuff.One of the best little Ramen Joints in the City.
Erica Jade L.}New York, NY}26}258}1}-1}5}8/27/2007}One big bowl of rameny goodness in one simply delicious operation. It's great when you're hungry because your bowl will land in front of you about a minute after you order. If you order the shio, add a little vinegar... you'll thank me later.Please note: this place is really small and rather poorly ventilated. That said, if you're having digestive "issues" then please (fortheloveofgodandallthatisholy) do not carry on at your seat like nobody will notice. We noticed. And I ran out of there so fast that I forgot to get my card stamped. See what you made me do? Sheesh.
Caroline B.}Brooklyn, NY}28}38}2}-1}4}8/23/2007}Who would've thought that late August in NYC would be the perfect time for ramen? Certainly not me, but as I headed out the door, bundled up in my jacket and the cold wind whipping through my hair, thoughts of steaming bowls of ramen danced in my head. If I don't feel like making the trek up to 55th Street to my favorite ramen joint in the city (Menchanko-Tei), Rai Rai Ken is a great alternative. It's a small restaurant situated in the East Village where you cozy up to the bar, peruse the short but sweet menu, give your order to the gentlemen behind the bar and relax with an ice cold beer while you wait for your noodles.  Besides four types of ramen (shoyu, shio, miso and the special curry ramen, all less than $8) there are a handful of appetizers and a couple of other entrees.  The shoyu, shio and miso ramen are very good - clean flavors and perfectly cooked noodles -- I have yet to try the curry.  I'll have to come here to try the cold noodles once the sun finally comes back out this weekend. The bar seats about 12+, so be prepared for a small wait.  Once seated, service from the dudes behind the bar is quick. Tell 'em what you want and it's in front of you before you know it.   Seating is a tad cramped -- watch your elbows or you'll whack the head of the guy next to you who's happily slurping his noodles.
Ro N.}New York, NY}83}2203}88}-1}5}8/22/2007}The ramen and fried rice is YUMMY IN ME TUMMY!!!!Plus this place offers you frequent cards to get stamped each time you buy a bowl of ramen.10 = FREE RAMEN!!!!WOOT WOOT!The place is small but the bright side is you can always get their attention since the staff is right in front of your face!
Ys C.}Mamaroneck, NY}20}44}127}-1}2}8/17/2007}This place had one of the best ramens in New York. However, during a recent visit it is apparent that the food quality is on the decline. I think they can use more ingredients in general, including even the noodles. I felt that they were cutting corners in such a significant way that it was seriously compromising the food quality, not just quantity. The "ramen experience" should be fulfilling, not wanting.In a tiny cramped bar-like shop and average prices with little service to speak of, if the food isn't made with heart, there's really not much going for it.
alisa o.}San Francisco, CA}17}64}26}-1}3}8/12/2007}the ramen was absolutely delicious. actually the best i have tried so far. why only 3 stars? there was a cockroach running across the counter right in front of my bowl...
Scott R.}Austin, TX}296}784}12}-1}4}8/7/2007}I'm not a ramen shaman but this ramen was calmingon a day I felt rotten. I ordered the Shoyu and it showed me enough.  Brothy and saltyif anything was faultyIt was light on pork and fishcake though it really wasn't needed And should this slight be called a mistakesuch words shan't be repeatedin regards to the oodles of noodles.The Shio is saltier and lighter and the fillings inside her are very similar to you know who (the Shoyu).Long bar, narrow place.  Did the best they could do with the space.  For lunch it's great and it's open late.  If it's your last bar of the night, you'll sleep all right.
Lynn F.}New York, NY}233}56}13}-1}3}8/6/2007}Stuffy nose. Scratchy throat. You know what that means- you have a cold and it's time for RAMEN!I've been reading about Rai Rai Ken on Yelp for a while but never justified making the trek out to the place until today.  Ducking into the tiny restaurant, my poor swollen nostrils were comforted by the steamy scent of broth.  I ordered the Shio Ramen (the seafood based soup with fishcake, seaweed, pork, egg, etc)  What I was not expecting: a SINGLE sliver of fishcake, ONE SLICE of pork, HALF of ONE boiled egg.  The portion itself was huge and tasty, but after the first few bites, nothing was left except for noodles and broth.   For $7.55, I had a filling lunch that soothed my achy head. But if you like variety in the bowl like I do, keep hunting for that perfect ramen...
Cindy O.}Long Beach, CA}77}17}19}-1}4}7/20/2007}The atmosphere.  The employees.  The food.  All awesome.  Wish I didn't live so far away.  Nothing like a steaming hot bowl of ramen to warm you up on a cold day.  Or a hot day.  Just drink more beer on the hot days.
michael m.}Encino, CA}37}34}1}-1}2}6/23/2007}I got into eating ramen by going to daikokuya in LA.  The ramen at daikokuya is really something special.  This place ain't nuthin' special.
Peter R.}Waltham, MA}25}43}2}-1}4}6/20/2007}Great place to eat.. probably the best thing about this place is the feel of it. You really do feel like ur traveling to Japan for a quick bowl of ramen. Really a fun experiance. The Noodles are cooked perfectly, and the broth is good though a little salty if you ask me. I suggest also you aske for more meat and extra egg but thats just how i like it.
alex w.}New York, NY}4}43}0}-1}4}6/6/2007}the four word review:  hot salty open latego for the miso ramen.  it's the tastiest in my book.  i appreciate this place most of all in the winter, it's like crawling in a warm sleeping bag.but it hits the spot any time of the year.
Andrew C.}New York, NY}60}27}0}-1}3}5/31/2007}Ahh ramen, definitely one of my top comfort foods. I'm always on the lookout for a great bowl of ramen, and Rai Rai Ken is right up there. Like Minca (my top ramen joint), the chefs at Rai Rai Ken seem like they pay attention to the presentation of the ramen bowl to the customer. For other foods, I usually don't give care as much about presentation because I'm all about flavor, but for some reason I really enjoy it when a bowl of ramen is decorated well and presented to a hungry customer as a masterpiece.I had the shoyu ramen (~$7), which was tasty. It came with the traditional toppings roast pork, egg, bamboo, fishcake, spinach and a nicely sized nori sheet. The broth was flavorful and not too salty. I also opted for an additional topping of corn ($1), which I highly recommend. it just makes it so much more fun to eat, with all those little corn kernels swishing around in your mouth. hahaI should note I think part of my good experience at this place is because the setup of this place is so quaint, with an small wooden bar right in front of the chefs, so you can hear and smell your bowl of ramen being prepared.
Larry Y.}New Providence, NJ}43}223}14}-1}3}5/30/2007}I have found memories of eating ramen in Japan, I wish ramen places were as common as their cars, comics and animation.Come to this Japanese ramen bar for decent fresh ramen and the atmosphere.   And they have some unusual toppings, such as butter and corn.
Rich H.}New York, NY}19}13}0}-1}3}5/30/2007}I love ramen noodles. Point being, Rai Rai Ken definitely satisfies my ramen hunger. For $7-8 a bowl, this place is great. I got the Shoyu Ramen with the basic fare of roast pork, egg, bamboo and fishcake, which was simple and satifying. However, not everything in this place is great. For the summer months, Rai Rai Ken starts to serve chilled noodle entrees. My friend got the chilled noodles with the ground beef and soy sauce mix, which I tried and was disappointed. The sauce was bland and somewhat watery.I'd say stick with the hot ramen soup bowls and you'll be happy.
Arlene C.}San Francisco, CA}153}409}336}-1}5}5/12/2007}Not much bigger than a closet, I came across this place accidently.  I got lost looking for Village Yoko Cho, and came across Otafuku, a great little take out place that makes Takoyaki, Okanomi Yaki (my fav) and Yakisoba.  Why am I reviewing another restaurant here? They also own Rai Rai Ken. I asked some folks that were standing in front, "Where can I get some good Ramen?", and was sent here.  After making a trek across the Brooklyn Bridge, I was cold and cranky (my usual disposition) and wanted a nice hot bowl of noodles. At 8:30 on a Friday night, I walked in behind someone who got the very last visible seat.  Feeling defeated, I looked to the left and one of 2 seats sandwiched in between the front windows and the counter seats had my name on it. Every time I had to get up to get my silverware and water, I had to make sure my arms were close to my body so that I could turn around.  I felt like the Dracena I once had that had big wide arms that made it difficult to place anywhere but in a corner.  Funny thing about places like this, here I not only tolerate the lack of space, I actually relish it....if this place was anywhere else I probably wouldn't step foot in it.It was cold and the Shoyu Ramen soothed my soul. Think vertical, horizontal doesn't fit here  ;-P
Jaime C.}Plano, TX}27}98}3}-1}5}4/24/2007}This place serves up some mean Ramen. Situated about as close as one can get to the food being cooked, you get a  glimpse into the medley of flavors that goes into these delicious soups. I would recommend this spot to anyone who is fond of the no frills authentic Asian street food.
Sonia C.}Seattle, WA}408}864}61}-1}4}4/15/2007}Stopped by for a quick dinner late Saturday night.  The place consists of maybe 15 counter seats all served by a very brief menu.  There are 4 different types of ramen soup bases - shoyu, shio, miso, curry - all with similar toppings.  There are also a few rice options and a short list of standard appetizers.I ordered the shio & my friend ordered the shoyu ramen.  Our noodles arrived piping hot a few minutes later.  What was there was good - tender pork, flavourful broth, spinach, springy noodles - but then, there wasn't much there.  I was satisfied with my bowl, but I'm accustomed to American portions!  There was only one slice of pork and a fistful of noodles.  The good thing about the broth was that it didn't cause me to reach for water the rest of the night.I would definitely come back because the food was tasty, but next time, I'll supplement my meal with some gyoza, edamame, or perhaps another bowl of ramen.
Sara N.}Emeryville, CA}127}85}39}-1}3}4/14/2007}If you're in the area and craving some hot tasty ramen or a small meal, head to Rai Rai Ken. They serve up pretty good ramen with decent prices. The broth and noodles are pretty good, but the portions seem a bit small. Keep in mind there aren't any tables. All the seats in the whole place are lined up around the counter and only total about a dozen. If you're a regular, take advantage of the frequent visitor card on the back of their business card. Enjoy 9 bowls of ramen and the 10th is free!
Susan O.}Brooklyn, NY}20}71}11}-1}3}4/5/2007}YUM. 3 stars is good because I'm mean. ITS REALLY GOOD. But don't go there because then there won't be any room for me.=)The shio ramen is the best. Get it with a pat of butter... the mild flavoured soup (you like the way i spelled *flavoured*, didn't you!) really brings out just a tbsp of butter, making the clean broth almost decadent.The side of pork with scallions is delicious, too... just get some rice w/ it, it's a bit salty.
T K.}New York, NY}5}59}0}-1}4}3/19/2007}talk about no-frills noodle service. i stepped in and sat down right away at an open counter space only to have the noodle man come up to me and take my order. i love it. it's unpretentious, simple and quick. though i hate to see the place packed...i mean what there's only about 10 seats?!? but anyways, for those lucky enough to find counter space, i highly recommend the shoyu ramen. I'm not a connoisseur of all things shoyu but this is some of the tastiest shoyu ramen i've had. the noodles were slurp-a-licious; the broth was sweet and you can get all this for under $10! how great is that?! to boot you don't have the wait of momofuku! i still enjoy a good bowl of ramen at momofuku though. david chang don't hate me!suffice to say of all the times i've been to RRK i've only had their shoyu. their gyoza is ok. as is their sauteed mixed vegetables. if i were you, i'd stick with the ramen.**disclaimer: after eating here, i was hungry again less than a couple hours later. hmm...does my disclaimer totally negate my rave review? i hope not. i just like to think that i'm still a growing boy.
Maria M.}New York, NY}247}509}52}-1}3}2/23/2007}It's cute.  But all I could think about as i ate was Momofuku and how it was so close by....
Kristine R.}Astoria, NY}298}363}1}-1}4}2/23/2007}Stepping into Rai Rai Ken makes me feel like I'm in Japan, which is a good thing since I'm a bit of a Japanophile (guess studying 4 years of the language will do that to ya).  I actually find the ramen very filling - lip-smacking broth and perfectly cooked noodles.  Even better with a bottle of Sapporo or Kirin.  Always at least a few Japanese guys dining here, which adds to the experience.  Then I step back outside and remember that I'm in NYC.  Oh well, I'll make my way back to Tokyo one of these days...
camilla c.}New York, NY}171}336}1}-1}3}2/3/2007}Not sure what more I can add to the copious reviews on Rai Rai Ken... all I know is that it really hits the spot when I'm hung over and/or craving some authentic Japanese ramen.  This is probably not the best ramen house in NYC (there's a great one on 49th/7th) but it's super convenient to where I live.  The noodles are fresh and the broth is not super oily like the ramen at some other places.  I like the shoyu and the shio ramen... and their dumplings are not bad either.
David S.}San Diego, CA}304}652}282}-1}5}2/2/2007}After moving to NYC, I looked for a long time for a good and cheap place serving Japanese ramen, which used to be one of my most common hunger fixes in CA. I tried a few various places but always ended up slightly unsatisfied. Then I found out about Rai Rai Ken... and I'm hooked. I never would have noticed the place if I hadn't read a review, as it is really small and a little out of the way (for me at least), but it's really worth the detour. The place is tiny (a total of about 10 seats along a bar, and you really have to squeeze in to get to your seat), but the decor is actually really cool. It's open until late (around 3am), and it's usually packed in the evening.As far as the food goes, it is really delicious. The selection of ramen isn't as large as you might expect (only four different kinds, but you can add extra toppings if you wish), but the quality is there. I usually have the miso ramen, which has a pretty thick miso based broth and comes with chicken, veggies, and fried garlic flakes (yummy). The noodles are very good in general (a couple of times they were slightly overcooked, but nothing terrible). I also like their gyoza, and their kimchi is delicious (if only it were free!!!). And the best part: around $7 for the ramen.
Naveen S.}New York, NY}29}22}0}-1}4}1/18/2007}A little bit of Japan once again in the East Village. It's ramen, but if you are looking for something quick and cheap and hot, you can't go wrong. Small menu; not many options. 14 stools. Hardly anyplace to put your big winter jacket. It's all about the experience.
anni b.}Brooklyn, NY}159}353}1}-1}3}1/13/2007}So tiny inside!  Smaller than any of the noodle bars I saw in actual Japan!Decent ramen soups, very authentic in every way, with great toppings.  Although I ended up eating again about an hour later.  Call me a fat American, but I was still hungry!Very confusing thing happened which was so sad.  No menus in sight, so we grab the one at the end of the long bar (where you sit).  The menu includes okonomyaki and takoyaki, two of my favorite Japanese dishes.  We try to order these dishes, and the guy says, no, that's a different restaurant.  I deduced that there's another place nearby, same ownership, that serves these other dishes, and they combined the takeout menus - and that's the only menu we ever did see.  It was very confusing.  And I didn't get to eat my octopus dough balls so it was sad.
Pam S.}Brooklyn, NY}186}412}399}-1}4}1/2/2007}Tiny spot, affordable prices, delicious ramen, and simply very Japanese-y noodle bar-ish. The ramen here beats anywhere else in the city in terms of value and the perfect consistency of the ramen.  If you're not in a noodle mood, the pork fried rice is also very tasty. The rest of the small dishes are pretty good, but if you want your ramen fix - down your big bowl here and go for dessert somewhere else.
Karen M.}Brooklyn, NY}124}292}47}-1}3}12/27/2006}Tasty ramen, however vegetarians be warned: there is nothing vegetarian on the menu. The miso ramen (which you would think would be vegetarian) isn't, even if you order it without chicken. If you tell them you  are a vegetarian, they can whip you up a soup with hot water.
Benjamin T.}San Francisco, CA}56}138}0}-1}4}12/15/2006}I loved eating here tonight. I'm usually eating in San Francisco, and definitely enjoy having a good bowl of ramen. The broth was fairly meaty, but came off smooth, and complimented the rest of the bowl nicely. They threw in crispy garlic, which accented, but not overthrow the rest of the meal. The service was quick, and the price was right. $7.50 for a good sized bowl of noodles. We also had edamame that was hot. I certainly like that better than the cold version. I'm definitely coming back again. Not that it's suprising, but the decor is a bit funky. I will definitely come back here again when I'm back in the City.
Dolapo F.}New York, NY}48}11}0}-1}4}12/15/2006}I love the noodles at this place. The gyoza could use some help but the noodles are great. 4.5 if you consider that you don't have to wait for an hour to eat here.
Yee C.}New York, NY}38}123}0}-1}3}12/14/2006}I am here to dip my toe into the rai rai ken vs. minca debate. I'm sorry but rai rai ken does not even compare, although if you're having some kind of ramen craving and are just suffering and for some reason can't get to minca, rai rai ken will do I guess. I'm not saying that rai rai ken isn't pretty good... it's DECENT... but the broth is kind of watery and not that flavorful, the pork is overcooked and not fatty at all (and you get like two pieces??), and the noodles were only ok, a little bit too soft... I don't get the hype about rai rai ken! I'd say it's an okay noodle joint, but momofuku is better, and minca is best.
Kain V.}Queens, NY}86}232}22}-1}1}12/11/2006}Bland broth (most likely because they just use water and nothing else for their broth), uninspiring noodles but fresh toppings, and small portions.  Pretty much a rip off for 7 bucks.  After eating here you will be hungry within a half hour.
Jonathan K.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}40}88}6}-1}4}12/11/2006}Rai Rai Ken is my favorite refuge on cold nights or when I'm jonesing for offensive quantities of ramen or japanese curry.  The space is tight, but happily stuffed patrons tend to make great conversation.  There's nothing like a belly full of chewy noodles and delicious broth.
Akino T.}Skillman, NJ}3}48}0}-1}3}11/27/2006}Ive been to a couple of ramen joints in the city and back in tokyo and firstly.. i just dont think there is excellent ramen here.. but.. THere are many places i stil havent tried so i may be proven wrong... after being unable to locate my original location (Momofuku) I stumbled into this one. The interior is tiny.. but of course true ramen eaters know this as a trademark of a traditional ramen places in japan so thats great for me.. but if youre a bit claustrophobic.. ud best avoid this place... and well.. if ur looking for atmomsphere in a ramen place.. u shouldnt be allowed to eat it anyway (yes i said it) That all being said.. id eat here again.. the soup wasnt too salty which i liked.. the charsiu pork was alright... I think berkshire is better.. but its like another reviewer said..."like an average ramen place in japan". And to me average is that... Now average is VERY good in my eyes.. thinking that even decent places didnt exist.. so keep that in mind.. the gyoza was alright.. but.. hmm.. i dont think the ppl working there were japanese which as  a japanese food snob.. i find a bit concerning but considering.. it was alright
Bianca L.}New York, NY}144}57}4}-1}4}11/10/2006}Get the Curry Ramen and the bamboo, seaweed appetizor thing. Back in SF, I alwasy get a miso ramen so that's usually how I figure out if I like the place or not. So.. I got my usual Miso ramen. My favorite was always Tanpop (see review below in SF)Hearing some good things about this, I expected some yummy happiness.Unfortunately, soup is blande for my taste (please don't kill me again)Noodle quality is good though. Appetizors (get the Menma) are good and Curry ramen seemed to be the better one. Hmmmm maybe... it's time to change my regular.. you think?Anyway it's tight and tiny just like street vendor food in asia which  I love.. Aah... how nostalgic.. I feel like I'm back in Asia. Cosy, and stuff so the decore gives good points from me.I just wish there was more flavor here.. Is this a common thing here in NY??? What's wtih the asian food here.. everytihng seems to lack flavor!!!ARGH! ok.. this is for another review....*edit - Update - SO I learned Miso ramen may be a west coast thing. Seems like Shoyu might the one to go with. In that case my review changes a bit as their shoyu, curry ramen is great. and their appetirzors are tasty (menma!! and pork thingamabob) and the decore still is definately cosy. It's fast. have your party  there (not big now like. 2-4 poeple max) and just dig in to the yummy ramen.
Carol C.}Austin, TX}91}147}9}-1}4}10/2/2006}i love ramen.  i am a ramen snob.  everything has to be perfect, from the pork to the noodles to the broth.  apparently, the day i went was a good low salt day and the shoyu broth was perfect.  the noodles were perfectly chewy, and the pork was pretty tender and flavorfull.  it wasn't quite 5 stars for me, but a really really good contender!  i'll have to go back someday and try the fried rice.  that may give 'em the extra star!
Kat W.}Lewisburg, PA}16}103}0}-1}4}6/22/2006}I know ramen.  ramen is supposed to be salty and greasy.  true ramen can never be drawn parallel to any of the instant noodles you buy in grocery stores.  I refer you readers to a Japanese movie called "Tampopo".  Rai Rai Ken is extremely close to a typical "average" ramen joint in Japan:  small and cozy, ineffective A/C, fast, open late (KEY) and hot salty ramen noodles.  But since this is in New York and not Japan, I'd add a star.   I do suggest  "Batten Ramen" in Fort Lee.  Now that's a truly authentic ramen place.
Kenneth K.}San Francisco, CA}5}44}0}-1}3}6/8/2006}So-so. Nothing to rave about. If you want a decent bowl of ramen in NYC that's reasonably priced, this is it. The ingredients were good, but they didn't provide much pork in the shoyu ramen and it was a tad too fatty. Noodle quality was ordinary as well. Like I said, there was nothing about it that was bad or would influence me to not return but it wasn't a place I would wholeheartedly recommend as THE place to have ramen in NY.
Emily L.}New York, NY}58}137}1}-1}3}4/10/2006}This long and narrow restaurant consists of a small open kitchen and a long bar which seats only about a dozen people.  If I remember correctly, the ramen runs $7-8 a bowl.  The ramen was pretty okay, but nothing spectacular.  The flavors weren't anything I haven't tasted before and I agree with Gourmet G. in that everything was just a little too salty. Another slight annoyance.  The sliced pork, hard-boiled egg, preserved bamboo shoots and seaweed were all cold and added at the last second, instead of cooked with the ramen and broth.  This made my bowl of ramen colder than I would have liked.  I mean, when I order ramen, I expect a big steaming bowl of hot comforting soup.
Emily K.}New York, NY}14}234}0}-1}4}2/28/2006}The perfect solution to a cold day.  There are only a handful of seats available in this cramped, tiny ramen bar that you're pretty much shoulder-to-shoulder with everyone, but that just adds to the feel.  Cheap and tasty, the curry ramen is by far the best, but their gyoza isn't bad either.  Nothing warms up a belly like a bowl of hot ramen.
Bobby F.}New York, NY}48}33}0}-1}5}2/27/2006}Momofuku may be great but the ramen is $13 a bowl there. When you want real ramen served up in a real ramen atmosphere Rai Rai Ken hits the spot. The ramen is affordable at around $7 a bowl and there are usually a few interesting options. I always throw in a dollop of butter, for 50 cents, to make it even more savory! This is the best before or after drinking food you can get! It is also a social kind of experience because you have to sit at the bar with everybody else. I have actually met quite a few people here and even if you don't talk there is a certain camaraderie about the shared experience of slurping some of the best soup in the city!
lisa p.}San Francisco, CA}13}56}0}-1}3}2/11/2006}A bowling alley-esque hole in the wall serving up Japanese noodles a few different ways. It's a good cheap option -- service is fast and the sides (gyoza for one) are a plus. I'd rank Rockmeisha's ramen #1, then Minca as runner up and Rai Rai Ken in 3rd.
Gourmet G.}San Francisco, CA}100}2100}2100}-1}2}12/17/2005}The name, commonly used for low-priced noodle shops in Japan, translates to Welcome House, and while you are greeted warmly and served attentively, the food fails to live up to its promise. Huge bowls of noodles topped with thinly-sliced pork or chicken, scallions, and hard-boiled egg look like the perfect antidote to a frigid winter day, but the excessive amount of salt used here is more in keeping with the packaged ramen found in the supermarket rather than a freshly-prepared batch. It overshadows any other flavoring that may have been added, and will have you gulping gallons of water for hours afterward. Fried gyoza dumplings, one of the few additional items on the limited menu, are a better option, but hardly worth a special trip to the area.
Peter S.}San Francisco, CA}21}76}7}-1}3}12/16/2005}I like the space, kind of homey and great for a cold winter day, and by "space" I mean shoebox. I mean that as a positive though, because you really get the full-on ramen smell as you eat....ummm, oh so hearty. The noodles are cheap, but way too salty, especially the curry ramen.
NaN K.}San Francisco, CA}35}74}3}-1}5}10/6/2005}Rai Rai Ken was like my second kitchen for the past 7 years that I dwelled in NYC. They serve up the freshest, steamiest & cheapest bowls of  ramen that I found while mobbing the streets of Manhattan. This is also one of the tiniest restaurants in NYC which only consists of a long but beautiful wooden bar with low  & fixed diner style stools...sit back and watch as the cooks ladle the steaming broth and build luxurious bowls of ramen before your eyes. The owner, a Japanese man, is very nice yet extremely quiet..if you've been there a couple times you can see just by the look he gives you that he's happy you've returned. Apparently he named this establishment in homage to the original Rairaiken of Tokyo which was built over 100yrs ago but today no longer exists. This is one other thing I always liked about Rai Rai Ken, it just oozes tradition. Dig into huge bowls of Shoyu, Shio, Miso, or my favorite, Curry ramen and slurp to your hearts content! FYI don't order the Shoyu ramen unless you like it salty. The name implies everything, shoyu is a soy sauce based ramen stock so it will be saltier than most. If you want something milder I'd suggest the shio. Each bowl is carefully handcrafted for you, complete with incredible presentation...scallion, fishcake, a square of dried seaweed and slices of wonderful pork lace each bowl(chicken can be substituted for those who don't eat swine). One can also choose from a small list of extras-to-be-added if you want more garnish...corn, crisp garlic, and EXTRA pork are among the options. However, everything in your bowl comes second to the amazing broth and perfectly cooked noodle. They also serve up a mean plate of gyoza(dumpling), tasty fried rices, and pan fried yaki soba(a chow mein style dish with tasty pickled ginger)...and YES they have beer & great prices...Arrre! The best kept secret about Rai Rai Ken is the "Frequenter's" Card...they won't really tell you about it or just hand you one but just ask for a stamp card and you'll be blessed. 1 bowl of ramen gets you 1 stamp...10 stamps = 1 FREE Bowl of the ramen of your choice! You WILL be satisfied!

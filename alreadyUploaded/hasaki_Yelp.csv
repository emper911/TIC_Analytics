Frida C.}Manhattan, NY}73}65}720}18}4}5/6/2018}Went during lunch time and was surprised that none of their lunch set has sea urchin - even chirashi or kaisen don! Look at this little sad bowl of Chirashi. Fish was good quality and sushi rice was seasoned well though. I personally find it a bit expensive for this variety of fish.
Michael G.}Chadds Ford, PA}0}3}0}-1}5}4/7/2018}Loved this restaurant! A wide selection, and everything top-notch. We had the prix fixe dinner of Black Cod, which cooked to perfection. A side order of the chef's choice sashimi was scrumptious. The beer selection was great - we had a Belgium-style dark made in Japan. Service was excellent and suitably understated. Will be back and highly recommend!
Ange L.}New York, NY}42}14}111}-1}5}3/31/2018}I've lived in NYC over 30yrs and I can tell you that Hasaki is One of my top neighborhood gems for quality, consistent, authentic Japanese food. Enjoy!
Alyssa C.}Taipei, Taiwan}0}2}0}-1}1}2/19/2018}Horrible. The service was horrible. Ordered a eel bowl set that's off-menu. One staff said it comes with salad AND soup, but then after such a LOOOOOOOOOONG wait, only the rice bowl and some pickled veggies showed up. After another long wait I still got nothing. Asked the staff and the waitress was like "oh do you still want it? what do you want now. I can give you salad first and heat up ur rice for you" with such a mean and rude tone. Then she walked away. I asked anther staff about why I am only getting soup and not both salad and soup, and he said I had to choose one that's the new policy. No one actually took the time to explain why the info is so inconsistent. Then a manager looking guy showed up, apologized by saying it must be a communication issue; the staff doesn't speak good enough English and are from Japan. Seriously?!? Bad attitude due to communication issue? Not giving me food due to communication issue? Not speaking English in east village thus causing communication issue?! This was supposed to be a birthday celebration and they TOTALLY ruined it. Horrible experience. Don't come. East village has much more to offer than this. You deserve better.
Anthony G.}Pelham, NY}56}20}10}-1}5}2/3/2018}Great sushi and sashimi! Ordered the chef's sashimi special at the sushi bar and was not disappointed. Staff was friendly, and offered to try the shrimp that came out which came out perfectly crispy and delicious.Also tried the clam miso which was nice and tasty.Prices are more than reasonable, especially for the area, and the place is very unpretentious.
Jackie L.}New York, NY}25}43}118}18}5}1/31/2018}I love this Japanese restaurant. ENVIRONMENT: It's conveniently located in east village on the street right next to St.Marks. This street is home to many authentic Japanese restaurants but Hasaki stands out to me as one that offers a variety of traditional Japanese food and a enjoyable dinning environment. The setting is casual but I can also see this as a great spot for dates and business dinning. The service is very good. FOOD: I like the Steak Don a lot. But I also like their miso soup, age tofu, salmon sashimi, and literally everything else. The food comes within 15mins.
Shayla G.}New York, NY}360}150}5}-1}4}1/29/2018}Second time coming here and I can officially say that this might be my new favorite spot in the city. Of course you can go to the super pricey spots and find better sushi, but for the price this is really a gem. The fish is always spot on, and the service is prompt. The atmosphere is slightly more sophisticated and calm  than a lot of the other similarly priced places. I love being able to get really good sushi that leaves me satisfied plus soup, tea, and tip for 50 bucks. That's a steal in New York if you like more traditional style sushi and not the spicy mayo, flying buttress, underwater caterpillar crazy rolls that you get at the cali-style places. Also, I love the Japanese toilets, even if it does malfunction sometimes.
David A.}New York, NY}0}6}1}-1}1}1/15/2018}I live in the neighborhood and hadn't eaten here for a while. I have visited Japan and have many Japanese friends. I know what good sushi is. I ordered the sashimi platter. I was given the "geijin special" that is food for non-Japanese people. The fish was stale and tasteless. Such a waste of money. Also the chefs behind the counter are cold and unfriendly. The whole point of sitting at the counter is to have some interaction with the people working behind it. I know where to get good Japanese in New York so I will never return to Hasaki.
Ashley D.}New York, NY}3}9}10}-1}4}12/4/2017}Never disappointed!! The food here is on the pricier side but you pay for the quality!! I typically get the afternoon plate if I make it for their lunch special. It comes with a lot of food: miso soup, salad, sushi, tempura, grilled salmon, etc. It's nothing extraordinary but everything is always fresh and I love the wide assortment if you're in the mood for a little bit of everything! I've been here three times and have always been seated right away; It's however a small spot and can get a bit stuffy. Sometimes the staff is slow but other than that no other complaints!!
Kevin T.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}2}12/1/2017}I have nothing good to say about this restaurant.  We had an okay experience.  Really slow and bad services, and the foods are way over priced $$$.   The waiters are so inexperienced.  They don't even know what is in the chef special dishes n' simply said the chef doesn't share with them either.  Then we got the wrong check at the end.  We will never come back to this restaurant again.
Peggy L.}Flushing, NY}5}7}0}-1}5}11/19/2017}Unbelievable experience! We have always past by the restaurant and never tried it until tonight! We had the Traditional Omakase. Every piece of sushi was distinct and delicious! Will definitely come back again!!
Endecott P.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}0}-1}2}11/19/2017}We have been going to Hasaki for over twenty years about once a week. We hadn't gone for about a year due to various circumstances and recently returned for dinner. First of all,there was no wait as there used to be, which surprised us. Then we sat down and were given menus. The first page was a Chef's tasting for $120 , second,page Omasake for $100, 3rd and final page, appetizers, small,plates. Wow! What a change. There was also a specials insert. We struggled to put together a meal we could afford at say $50 each in total. We couldn't and have been satiated. What a change. All of our favorite items have been removed. So we sadly left, and will not return. If we want to pay those prices we can think of many other restaurants that can justify those prices. Hasaki can't, in so many ways. Plus there are many great Japanese restaurants that are terrific at a fraction of their price . Japonica comes to mind. Hasaki has an inflated sense of who they are now and has abandoned the terrific generous restaurant they were, a restaurant that had loyal following for decades. A supreme shame.
Ayumi W.}New York, NY}393}148}222}18}5}11/13/2017}Tucked away on 9th street surrounded by other Japanese restaurants, Hasaki has quality sushi that is well worth your money. We ordered sake and Chirashi. Despite the simplicity of the chirashi and sashimi, it was excellent. Fresh, quality, flavorful fish. Pricey but not ridiculous, this restaurant is a great traditional sushi spot. We also enjoyed the sake that was recommended by the waiter
Junko H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}4}2}-1}5}11/7/2017}I love this place. Always welcoming and food is good , service is good , price is good! Also it's not only sushi place. Authentic Japanese style of side menu that really good quality too.
Hannah K.}Jersey City, NJ}9}48}123}18}4}11/2/2017}Such a quaint (please read as little tight and small during busy hours) and authentic place in Little Tokyo! Came during lunch and the food, service, and overall experience were flawless. I had the afternoon plate which comes with a little bit of everything and is super filling. It includes miso soup, salad, grilled fish, pickled veggies, assorted tempura, a choice of sushi or sashimi and dessert. It felt like a course meal and the timing of everything was perfect.Understandably, this place is on the pricier side but you get what you pay for which is quality food and attentive service. Great place to bring parents/guests or just for a treat yourself kind of meal :)
Hitomi M.}New York, NY}8}20}33}-1}3}11/1/2017}I went for dinner long ago. Sushi was not bad. But I waited for the table for a long time. I recommend making a reservation. The man 's server attitude was bad, so I didn't feel good.
George G.}Las Vegas, NV}21}22}6}-1}1}10/29/2017}Our server was very knowledgeable about Japanese food, and was extremely helpful, however, while the quality of food was good, I can not understand the immense hype this establishment has for its price quality ratio. We ordered some thin meat, excellent, but nothing to die for. Spinach that can be done at home, sushi was good, but not better than other places. Personally, I suggest to go elsewhere. We spent close to 150 a pop for 2 spinach, 3 slices of meat and 4 sushi rolls each.. wtf..
Mi Rae C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}46}353}1333}18}4}10/17/2017}Very nice lunch after a day of shopping in SoHo/Nolita.  Had all the key items for a well rounded lunch full of raw, grilled and fried dishes.
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}2}10/14/2017}Used to love this place until the last time i went and the rice on the sushi was yellow and tasted super vinegary. Did not return since then.
Laura S.}Manhattan, NY}104}266}4}18}4}10/9/2017}This place deserves 5 stars for the quality, flavor, and value of the sushi.Unfortunately I knocked off a star for the service. Staff and chefs are extremely friendly and professional, but I had a very odd experience last time I came here with my husband to enjoy the omakase chef special.It took about 20 minutes in between tastings to receive our sushi piece. In fact, we even watched our chef prepare other clients' bento boxes, while hungrily awaiting our next piece. It was torture! We complained and management was extremely compassionate and compensated us accordingly.I'll definitely return, as I had been here a couple of times and really do love the sushi, and maybe upgrade my review. To be continued...
Sam M.}Baltimore, MD}108}89}25}-1}2}9/23/2017}Don't let the 4 star rating fool you, this sushi is not worth it. The fish didn't taste fresh, the sushi had far too much wasabi, and everything seemed like it was thrown on the plate. I've eaten here before and it was alright, but the quality has declined in the past year.
Elisa H.}Brooklyn, NY}1577}428}868}18}3}9/21/2017}Nothing stood out but nothing was bad. It was busy because it's situated prettily in the caddy corner of st marks sq. Cute revolving spot, I'm not sure this is good for a date or a meeting. Maybe when everywhere else is closed or it's a summer holiday when everyone is away, it would be a chill spot to relax but it's just not worth the wait for ok food. Sorta goes to show it's not quality nor quantity when it comes to supply and demand- it's location, location, location.
Laura W.}Jersey City, NJ}73}3}0}-1}5}8/19/2017}Mori! He's the man. We always get the top notch sushi here. It's a small place in the basement but it's worth the wait. Have been going here for years
W L.}Manhattan, NY}1}69}6}-1}4}7/23/2017}I was very pleased with the sashimi here. The chirashi bowl came with a good assortment of fish. It's rare for restaurants to throw in ika so I was pleasantly surprised when they did! It's high quality stuff that don't burn a huge hole in your wallet. Will be back!!
Jainnielyn C.}Queens, NY}108}156}499}18}5}7/16/2017}Lunch reviewThis little fancy spot is LES is well worth it's value in gold - for lunch time, that is. A staircase leads you down to a clean contemporary environment to enjoy great food and service.Afternoon plate ($21)Sushi or sashimi, grilled fish, tempura, and more. I believe it was 5 or 6 pieces of delicious sushi albeit on the smaller side, and a wonderful assortment of food. It's great for people who only want a few bites of a variety of things.The tempura was a concern for me, since I have shellfish allergies. They were able to accommodate it well, by serving just veggies and frying it in separate oil from shrimp. Overall, this is an awesome spot - food, service, ambience and prices - if you can hit it up during lunch time!
marin r.}Manhattan, NY}0}34}0}-1}3}7/5/2017}Quality fish, new menu.... but plan to get a slice of pizza after.Longtime customers, we ordered usual sake and sushi. It was delivered in short order - minus the complimentary miso soup and salad which have been discontinued. Server did not mention this - should have asked if we wanted soup or salad, especially if it is not going to be delivered as per gracious Hasaki tradition of 20+ years. The pieces of fish are also quite a bit smaller. And the price went up. Maybe this is why it was somewhat empty during dinner hours. I was always willing to pay steeply for the higher quality fish (we have another choice for 'everyday' sushi) the extras made it feel like a complete dining experience.
Katherine M.}South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA}163}8}0}-1}5}7/2/2017}This sushi amazed me. Great service, great food. Got the sushi for two and loved every piece.
Nichakul T.}Queens, Queens, NY}0}5}14}-1}1}6/23/2017}First time here and last time !!!!!!Had OMAKASE lunch everything was worstI ordered uni from JAPAN but the taste was sucks its like uni from Maine.PS.JUST SILVER FISH FOR OMAKASE LUNCH!!!!!!!!!
Lÿda D.}New York, NY}0}26}12}-1}5}6/22/2017}Came in for a late night dinner with my husband and the staff and sushi chefs were very warm and welcoming. The service was great and their sushi was delicious and fresh!
Narges A.}Manhattan, New York, NY}240}1}0}-1}2}6/20/2017}Believe it or not, this is the first review I have ever written for any restaurant, or any establishment for that matter. I have had terrible service or terrible experiences elsewhere, for sure. I'm a 28 year old social and outgoing person living in New York City, it's impossible not to have a couple of bad experiences, but the experience I had at Hasaki last night has forced my hand to write my first ever review. Got there a little after 8. My boyfriend had seen this place on Yelp and read some reviews. This was date night and we were expecting to have some great sushi. As you may know already, Hasaki doesn't accept reservations so we put our name down and went for a drink closeby. The wait wasn't too bad--I'd say around 30 minutes. We were ecstatic (I will say that the atmosphere feels like an authentic Japanese sushi joint, and we even had the best seat in the house--right next to the window.) However, none of this was enough to overshadow the terribleness that was the food at this place. The miso soup wasn't even miso soup. It tasted off, almost like a tangy, somewhat bitter aftertaste. No seaweed (which is fine as there are variations of the soup, but this was honestly the worst I've ever had.) Next came the spicy octopus appetizer, or as it should be renamed, the "chewy, tasteless plastic." Following closely behind was the shumai (I had asked the waitress whether she recommended steamed or fried and she responded that their most popular was the steamed, so that's what we got. Wish we hadn't.) 4 huge dumplings that literally tasted like water...or nothing. I had to drown the massive balls in soy sauce to make them edible. We got the sushi premium omakase which came with truffles and caviar and a price hike. Again, disappointed. The fish was not fresh and overall didn't taste good. The age tofu was the only item (appetizer) we had that wasn't horrible, and we both genuinely agreed that the food was pure garbage. Please don't ruin your date night or fun weekend dinner. Head over to Blue Ribbon on Sullivan street or Takahachi. Hasaki was such a bust.
Debi C.}New York, NY}191}5}3}-1}5}6/4/2017}Great atmosphere. Great service. Great food. Was recommended this place by a friend and it was amazing. The fish is very fresh and delicious and it is mot always the best i dea to grt sushi on Sunday's. We ordered negi Toro roll, salmon roe roll, yellowtail sashimi, spicy tuna roll, and eel avocado roll. Definitely recommend if you are a foodie and a tough critic. I will be coming back here many more times to try more of their amazing menu. Arigato :)
Shonnie H.}Manhattan, NY}596}539}2419}18}2}5/16/2017}A solid NO for omakase here. The pieces are tiny, the chef is inaudible, and an overall underwhelming experience. We both ordered the omakase special for $80 at the chef's counter. We walked in on Monday at 8:30pm with no ressy and were seated at the counter immediately. Glad we didn't opt for the "Premium." Utterly disappointed - I wasn't thinking it was super high-end but it's certainly not on the cheaper side of the scale either. At this price margin, I'm expecting at least a half-way meeting point of buttery, melt-in-your mouth pieces of soosh.I also thought that the service was lackluster. We made our order and our waitress clearly forgot our bottle of sake, at which point, changed to a carafe to accommodate the amount of time that's passed already. We had to ask for green tea, and it always had to be asked to be refilled. The interior always needs a heavy facelift. It's rundown, and being that it's small, the tables are pretty cramped. Mostly non-Asian patronage.
Liia L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}1}-1}4}5/9/2017}After going to a mock sushi restaurant the day before and experiencing what may have been the worst service and the worst sashimi & japanese food we ever had, my friend and I were in persute of a remedy to rekindle our love for the cuisine. We decided to go to east village and find an authentic japanese restaurant. After looking through a list of yelp reviews and walking by a few locations we decided to go to Hasaki. Upon arrival we were immediayely drawn to the warmth and vibrancy of the entrance which is nestled away on the the basement level of the corner of 9th & 3rd. The steps down to the door are tucked away behind bushy greenery which softens the noise from the streets. It was Sunday evening and the place was briming with people and a line up outside. We assumed that the wait would be at least an hour but when greated by the host we were squeezed in no less than 5 mins. From the moment we were seated the service and execution of the cuisine was seemless and exceptional. All of the many servers and couple of chefs were so friendly and polite. Just that alone created such a warm and welcoming atmosphere to dine in which amplefied the already serene and cozy decor and overall setting. We ordered miso soup, seaweed salad, horse mackrel tataki (with freshly grated ginger), the sashimi platter for two, bottle of saki to share, mug of tea and two bowls of ice cream. Wow. Every dish blew us away with its freshness, clarity, depth,  richness, refinement. The nuances of the ingriedients in the dishes were magnified and exemplified so brilliantly. The miso soup broth had a dark and rich robustness so much better than the normal white miso normally offered . The seaweed salad presentation was so beautiful. It was a variety of colors, shapes and textures served with the most amazing sauce... it tasted like a sweet lemony tangy light mayo vinegrette. The mackeral tataki was so fresh and had a crisp and clear flavor as if it was just caught. It was served with nothing other than soms fresh raw grated ginger bringing out a divine like combination. The only complaint was that there was too little. The sushi and sashimi for two was better than one could expect. Every piece of sushi and sashimi were perfectly sized (not too big) and had such a perfect balance in flavor, taste, texture, tempature. Each piece was someting to spend time to savor. It was so apparent how much care and thought went into the preperation and excecution. Making it feel like people are sharing something special and leaving you with the feeling that you are grateful for it. Even though were were totally sasiated half way through the platter we ended up eating the whole tjing. It was just so good. The little tjings that normally turn me off of sushi were all non existant. For example salmon roe sushi is often too salty and overpowering but there the flaver is soft and buttery and melts in ones mouth. The unagi don were to die for. Firm and lean pieces of meat with just enough bbq glaze to coat the eel in a delious layer of heaven. The sashimi was so remarkably fresh (not the freshest ive had - which is reason for 4 & not 5 stars) but totally more than noteworthy. By the end of the meal we were so immensly full and could not imagine being happier. Nathrally, the only logical thing to do was to order ice cream! They had a great selection. We ordered matcha and black sesame seed. The best ice cream we ever had. I cant give this restaurant more accolades from the atmosphere to service, presentation, quality of food, excecution of menu... i could go on forever. With all of this considered it felt like the bill should have been much more than it was. We would have been happy to pay double. So highly recommend Hasaki. It felt like a proper japanese dining experience leaving the desire to go back again and again.
Nathan L.}San Francisco, CA}11}78}38}-1}4}5/9/2017}I am torn between 4 and 4.5 stars.The sushi was awesome - even on a Sunday night near closing time. And the price point for the quality is very welcoming. Everything we had was good, but not amazing so 4 stars it it! The service was very friendly and accommodating too!Standout dishes included: vegetable tempura (very traditional with only lemon and salt), Chinese broccoli, and the sushi dinner (most of the pieces were flavorful and all were well made).Okay dishes included: garlic beef (it was overly tough and not very flavorful), and chicken karaage (fine flavor but not crispy in any sense).Nice little underground spot in the east village with mellow vibes!
Alexandra C.}Manhattan, NY}60}94}1783}-1}4}5/6/2017}The lunch special here is pretty bomb. Now that I live downtown, this is my new favorite casual sushi joint. High quality food, and it's always easy to get a seat here.
Delphine C.}Manhattan, NY}148}8}22}-1}4}4/6/2017}Came here because the BBQ spot next door has no seats. Tried their Omasake for a party of two. Sashimi are fresh but not very impressed actually. One beef course was really creative, tasted really great and very beautiful in look. Also like their Caviar Tartare, feeling it melt in mouse.
Lilian S.}Brooklyn, NY}71}36}70}-1}5}3/29/2017}Bf and I finally came to give this sushi bar a try. Do not underestimate the wait time. If the waitress says 40 minutes, it would not be any faster than that, especially if you go during the peak dinner hours. The interior of the restaurant is super charming, made me picture how it would be like if I ever go and visit Japan. Our waiter's name is Rikiya, he was very attentive, polite, informative and patient, as we had quite a few questions to ask about the menu and different kinds of fish. Here was what we ordered: Clams miso soup - darkest miso soup I've ever seen in NYC, and there were plenty of clams in our tiny bowls. Giant clam sashimi (special) - $30 (5 pieces) [ OHHH MYYY GODDDDD! SWEETEST GIANT CLAM WE'VE EVER TASTED!!!!! AND WE LOVE THE CUT OF THEM! ] Hot house sake - $16 [ SO GOODDDDD THAT WE ENDED UP ORDERING A SECOND BOTTLE!!!!] And here were the lists of sushi/sashimi we ordered: 1st order - Otoro sushi x2Blowfish sushi x2Aji-Horse Mackerel Sushi x2 (One of my favorites!) Striped Jack Sushi x2Sea Eel Sushi x2Tamago Sushi x2Uni Sushi x2 (ahhhhh-mazing!) 2nd order-Octopus Sashimi x2 (so sweet!) Miyazaki Beef (A5) Sushi x2 (very buttery!) Red Snapper Sushi x2Aji-Horse Mackerel Sushi x2 (LOVEEEEEEEE ITTTT!) Yellowtail Sushi x2 (omg omg omg! Never had tasted such tasty yellowtail!) Salmon Roe Sushi x2 (DE-LI-CIOUSSSSSSSS!) Uni Sushi x2 (ahhhhhhhhhh-mazing again!!!) Last but not least, we would not miss the desserts! A scoop of black sesame ice cream ($4) - OMG! Best black sesame ice cream we've ever tasted!!!!! There was actually black sesame bits in the scoop of ice cream!!!! And now we have one less reason to go visit Mitsuwa (a Japanese supermarket in Fort Lee)! - When we told our waiter that we fell in love with the ice cream, he explained that the ice cream is in fact made by the restaurant themselves! SUPER IMPRESSIVE!!!! Tips: 1) THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS FOR TABLES, GO EARLIER (530-6)  OR GO LATER (930) TO AVOID 1-1.5 HOURS WAIT. 2) They ONLY take reservations for Chef Mori Select, 6 courses, $140 /person! 3) It is a bit pricey compared to any local sushi restaurant, but it is totally worth it! Try the special fishes if you enjoy them as much as we do! 4) The restaurant is located in the basement, and it's very easy to miss! KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!!!! We'll be back for sure!
Diana J.}Manhattan, NY}0}14}0}-1}4}3/29/2017}Revisited this little Japanese restaurant, after about 15 yrs, with a family member I used to enjoy it with.Happy to find the same good service, beautifully fresh sashimi, lightly cooked salmon and green tea ice cream.  Glad to find something I know well which has not changed in this ever-changing city.Even though living downtown is but a memory, I will make the trip from the West Nineties again for Hasaki's enduring quality.
Naomi S.}Berkeley, CA}356}127}100}18}4}3/11/2017}The sushi for two tasted very fresh, offered great variety, and a better deal than ordering dishes separately. Portion size was good. None of the fish particularly stood out. Only thing that I didn't love was the wasabi on each piece of sushi, since I'm not a wasabi fan.
Rev R.}Bayonne, NJ}0}22}1}-1}4}2/10/2017}Been coming to Hasaki for years. What it has that is great is the following: The absolute best seaweed salad I've ever had! The sesame sauce is incredible. The have a good selection of fish, not just the usual boring gamut. They also have rotating specials of fish and various oddities at times (like Cod milt). Their Toro tartar is phenomenal as well. They have Sapporo on draft. Another great thing about this place - no reservations taken! Anyone who knows sushi in Manhattan knows if you don't have a reservation forget trying to get a table same day at most places. It's typically just a short wait here even on Friday night. What I don't like? For the love of God please stop being so cheap with your sushi portions/cut sizes! For the price being paid the pieces are insultingly small. For example, got one of their today's special single fish sashimi plates. Was like $25 and I got four very thinly sliced half inch by  half inch slices, and it wasn't even a pricey fish like Oh Toro. The sushi pieces are very narrow and small. The quality is great, but the portions are smaller than nearly all other top notch sushi restaurants I've been to.
Bakchun K.}New York, NY}90}492}1110}18}4}2/1/2017}My friend and I came here for the Prix Fixe Twilight Dinner.   The place opens at 5:30 and the deal is up until 6, so if you snooze, you lose.  Like seriously? Just half hour for the deal?  We had the sashimi and sushi set.  Each set came with lots of small portions of yumminess, put together which constitutes a full size meal.  There was miso soup, salad, sashimi or sushi, vegetable tempura, grilled salmon, eggplant, lotus root, and dessert for $22.  It was a lot of food and it was delicious.  For the sashimi, you get 7 total pieces - salmon, tuna, and yellowtail.  For the sushi, you get 3 pieces of sushi and you get to pick a roll.  Dessert was a disappointment because it was just plain ole fruit.  Japanese place serving fruit for dessert? where is my ice cream?  The decor was nice as it was very Japan like.  Service is good and quick, didn't have to wait forever for the food.  It's a good deal.
Nicole S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}69}13}0}-1}3}1/30/2017}I was disappointed overall. My Omakase was just OK. The sushi was fresh but pieces were VERY small and VERY overpriced for what it is. Compared to Tomoe sushi for example where the Omakase is phenomenal..very large pieces of fish in great quantity, priced well and better quality...On the other hand our salmon teriyaki was exceptional. A mixed bag but overall...overpriced
Kim C.}Brooklyn, NY}0}38}2}-1}5}1/26/2017}very quick service and super charming interior. nice light portions for lunch.i actually just realized i never received my sushi with my afternoon plate set, but it was still delicious.
Xinyu L.}New York, NY}99}145}647}18}4}1/21/2017}It's a three $$$ sign Japanese restaurant, but the checks in the end for 3 is not that bad at all. The ingredients are very fresh and the service is really good. Be prepared to wait for 30 minutes minimum on a Monday night for a table though.
Helen Y.}New York, NY}338}838}3671}18}5}1/7/2017}Many people say they dream of food but they mean that figuratively. Not me. I've dreamt of tables awaiting me with every conceivable flavor cupcake, and huge platters of clams, fried so their plump bellies burst all liquid in my mouth. Not being Jiro, I have never dreamt of sushi. Might I now, I wonder, after my last visit here?Hasaki's a place I've dined at, many years ago. Somehow, I never had the luck to get in when I was with my bestie ,no matter the few times we tried. The lines were always too long and we didn't want to wait. But some days, the keys in the universe just open the doors. So there we were, one mellow winter night.You could be in a surreal dream when you enter. The pale woodwork by the sushi bar, where the chefs work, is just beautiful, flowing cross- sections of a tree against a blue background, gives you the impression of sea and sand. There's a tranquil simplicity to the wooden tables and chairs, though the feel is more elegant than rustic. I honestly don't remember if the décor has changed but now, it's a pretty place to dine in, and clean and soothing. Even the cork covered menu is a visual and tactile pleasure.And the sushi? Each piece of the Sushi Dinner for Two we had was exquisite. Each fish had its own sweet taste, subtle, and different. The texture of the fish revealed their freshness, each piece like creamy butter, tender or even succulent, as the shrimp were. Even the three rolls, tuna, yellowtail and spicy tuna, were made with good quality fish, not like the odd pieces and lower grade fish cleverly masked in some spicy tuna rolls by the spicy sauce. My friend remarked that even the cod roe sushi was so fresh there wasn't the merest hint of fishiness in the orange bubbles. That was true of the yellowtail here, the reason its usually my least favorite type of fish. The sushi rice was perfect too, not too hard, not too soft. These aren't monster pieces of sushi but sized just right, to be eaten with one bite. The green salad that comes with the entrée is a nice size and tasty. I had chosen the miso soup. A darker miso than the soups I've had in other places, it was rich with an interesting depth of flavor. Note that if you get the Sushi Dinner for Two, you do get a choice of an extra roll, though if you pick one of the more expensive ones, there is a surcharge. This isn't the cheapest sushi, but it is top notch sushi. Prices have gone up over the years, but you would expect that with most places.  I wonder if some clients have been lost to cheaper sushi spots, as they are  in the East Village. I'm grateful Hasaki has done well to flourish over many years, and hope they continue.Service here is what you would expect from a quality Japanese restaurant, gracious and efficient. With excellent sushi and great staff, you can understand why the place was always packed. Even the green tea they serve is a better quality. If there's a line and you can wait, do. If like me, you've lost your patience for long lines, try to come during a quiet time, like around the holidays, when many New Yorkers have gone. You might leave dreaming of sushi until you return.
Hello I.}Manhattan, NY}2}114}4}-1}4}1/4/2017}Good lunch special at reasonable price.  Delicious red miso soup.  Good place for real Japanese food.
Whynbbn W.}Manhattan, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}1/2/2017}Our go to sushi and traditional Japanese restaurant for the last 20+ years.  Went there on New Year's Eve for brunch.  1. The steam shumai with wasabi soy sauce was amazing as well as the agedashi tofu (drank the dashi sauce afterward, subtle and refined).2. Afternoon plate is the usual for me.  It comes with their signature red miso soup and salad (the sesame dressing is amazing).  They started selling the sesame dressing last year but haven't seen it lately on the menu.  I even attempt to make my own version but it doesn't come close.  More the reason to keep coming back.  I enjoy the seasonal vegetable and hijiki seaweed that came with the set.  The tempura is fried to perfection.  Grilled salmon along with sashimi completes the set.  Their salmon sashimi is very fresh.3. Flower Garden is another must.  The new California roll uses real snow crab.  The spicy tuna is the best, it has a hint of sesame oil.  The plate is beautifully arranged like a flower arrangement.4. For dessert they always serve you a different tea (roasted hojicha - green tea).  And the sesame ice cream is to die for.
Helen K.}Manhattan, NY}2}15}27}-1}4}12/23/2016}Most authentic clean Japanese food in decent price, weekend brunch menus are great! Try box selections, you'll be able to try many different flavors. My favorite desserts from this place is black sesame ice cream! Amazing!
Jessica L.}New York, NY}0}33}10}-1}5}12/3/2016}Very good vibes - calm, low-key japanese interior. Clean.Got the sushi dinner, very delicious - amazing value.Chicken Karaage was very good as well, as was the shumaiSuperb food quality... liked the ambience Would definitely come back.
Marc P.}Setauket- East Setauket, NY}0}25}0}-1}5}11/5/2016}We have been coming to Hasaki for years, it is a perfect go to sushi spot, very high quality and service, and fair price.  We've been to most of the high scoring sushi restaurants, and keep coming back to Hasaki.Very fair chef sushi-sashimi dinner and I usually go with a bento for lunch.  Everything you want in a small, good sushi spot, and no fusion, cream cheese or odd colored tobiko...
K. C.}New York, NY}0}183}0}-1}5}10/26/2016}This is probably one of the earliest upscale sushi restaurants in New York I had the opportunity to eat at long ago.  Before our recent dinner, the last time I ate at this restaurant was over 20 years ago.  We were so glad to see it was still open.   The place remain the same.  The decor is not flashy, very low key and simple -- what you would expect from a traditional sushi restaurant.  We had the sushi sashimi dinner for two.  It was excellent.  The cuts of fish were wonderful and the variety was great.  The presentation was exceptional.  Glad to know it remains in business after all this time and given our dinner, we are not surprised and hope it continues to be open for a long time.
April C.}New York, NY}2}98}277}-1}3}9/28/2016}Had the sushi combo for 2 and thought the fish were just ok in terms of quality (compared to the other restaurants in the same neighborhood). Will need to come back to try their omakase before i can fully say i've gauged their potential.
Grace S.}New York, NY}389}11}1}-1}5}9/19/2016}Came here on a Monday night at 6PM and it was pretty empty at first. My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and ordered the sushi and sashimi platter for two since we weren't sure if we could finish the omakase that night. It consisted of 9 pieces of sashimi each (3 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 yellowtail, & 2 red snapper) , 4 pieces of sushi each (toro, ikura, eel, shrimp) and two rolls. Came on a well presented platter and with a soup or salad for each.  Pros: 1. Was honestly pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fish and taste. I usually am not a big fan of tuna and usually avoid ordering it, but their tuna blew me away and it wasn't even bluefin. Their salmon was buttery as well and much better than the lot of salmon I've had. One of the rolls was AMAZING, we did not ask for the exact name of it, but it was chopped up tuna with orange tobiko and scallions with a sauce.2. The miso soup was pretty good, different than the usual you would get from most Japanese restaurants, had a more soy sauce flavor. Cons: 1. The omakase comes as a platter instead of plate by plate which turned us off from ordering it. Would much prefer it if it was more personalized and came a bit at a time instead of all at once. 2. Sushi chef did not really talk to us, but to be fair, it was us two girls unwinding from a rough day of work and classes so we were blabbing to each other for most of it.3. The other roll we had resembled a california roll, but was not fond of this. We also got a cooked shrimp sushi and eel that I wasn't crazy about because I prefer raw fish but it's a preferential thing because my friend enjoyed it. All in all I would have given 4 stars based on the cons but the meal was honestly so good that most of the cons can totally be overlooked. Really hope they can put in place a traditional plate by plate omakase option though! Will definitely be back.
Marina S.}Bridgewater, NJ}13}6}0}-1}1}9/17/2016}Very thick seaweed paper that is really chewy. Sushi was subpar and very little selection. Not great at all.Also both my mother and myself felt very ill about 5 hours later. Fish was not fresh just as I suspected. Now I feel like crap on a Saturday night.
Cameron H.}Los Angeles, CA}537}2}0}-1}1}9/13/2016}This was literally the worse eating experience I have had while dinning out, it was our last evening in NY while on business so we decided to take friends (a couple) out to dinner to have our favorite, sushi, everything started out great the environment is beautiful the staff is great, clean and a rather nice Japanese establishment. We ordered our food, and decided to split bills because my partner and I wanted more traditional sushi and sashimi while our friends were more into cooked meats. Our friends food came out about 15 minutes after ordering, while ours didn't, so we waited, and waited, and waited, our friends completely finished eating their food almost and hour after ordering about 45 minutes after their plates arrived, and we decided to cancel our order. Just then they show up with our rolls and sashimi on a big platter and say sorry for the wait would you like us to box it because you would not like to stay, they were actually trying to get us to take the food and pay for it, I honestly couldn't believe they had the nerve I have 13 years experience in fine dining and I would never actually ask a customer to pay after I so royally messed up, and to top it off the sushi chefs made it clear to have a problem with us as they pointed at us and spoke with a negative tone, so when they then returned with everything boxed we no longer trusted them to have not done something to our food. We are rather upset to have such a bad experience as we had high expectations from friends who eat here often, maybe it was just a fluke but I can honestly say we left feeling pretty disrespected when the chefs made a point to speak poorly about us while standing right next to our table.
Brion R.}New York, NY}324}220}8}-1}5}9/3/2016}"One of the sushi stars...."I'm hesitant to write about this place for fear will that it will be overrun by likes of you.  But I like this place so much that I hope they get more business and prosper.I love everything about this place.  It's quaint and authentic decor, the charm of the sushi chefs, the focus on really fresh fish and perfect presentation.Nods:1) Get the Omakase and sit at the sushi bar.2) The miso is much better than average3) The sake is goodHead shakes:1) Wine list is crap, like most sushi restaurantCelebrity sighting:- John Leguizamo, infamy of "Sid the Sloth" and Chips, in Fish n' Chips 2.
Priscilla C.}Sacramento, CA}169}302}1553}18}4}8/27/2016}Came here on a random Saturday afternoon for lunch. I have passed by this place a couple of times, but for some reason, have never thought about trying it out until today. Restaurant is located in a semi basement and can be easily missed if you are just strolling by. The inside has a cozy, clean and nice interior with a long counter seating where you can watch them prepare the sushi. We ordered the "afternoon platter," "una-ju soba set," and the garlic beef as appetizer. The afternoon platter included tempura (eggplant, carrot, broccoli, shrimp x2), 6 pieces of tuna rolls, 4 pieces of sushi or sashimi (red snapper, salmon, tuna and I'm not sure what the last piece was) and a piece of grilled fish (salmon). It also included salad, miso soup and dessert (fruits, nothing fancy like Japanese dessert). The soba set included a hot or cold soba plus a rice bowl of your choice (we chose una-ju which is the eel over rice). The garlic beef was pretty good with lots of flavor, was soaked in soy sauce and pieces of roasted garlic lined the top. Both the combos were good, fish was fresh, and both combos were worth the price. The eel bowl was really good, rice was super soft with lots of eel sauce. Soba noodles were okay, nothing special. Our meal was $53.35 including tax which I thought was a fair price.
Molly P.}Brooklyn, NY}1}39}0}-1}4}8/20/2016}We had sushi and sashimi for 2 at the sushi bar. It was quite good, fish was plentiful and tasted very fresh. We also has a smoked baby octopus appetizer that was notable. We had a carafe of sake and several beers and all in, including tip, it was about $160. We left very satisfied. The only small issue was the AC - it was warmer than I would have liked in the restaurant. However, it was a legit heat wave so this probably wouldn't be the case on a normal day.
Josh L.}Manhattan, NY}11}82}0}-1}2}7/30/2016}Went there in early 2015 - has to be one of the thinnest cut fish we have seen. Quality wasn't good either. I don't get it.
Marissa P.}New York, NY}140}500}17}18}5}7/16/2016}This is my current favorite sushi restaurant in the city.  I have been here several times and love how authentic it is!  Very close to Japanese sushi restaurants that I have been to in Japan.  You won't find Americanized sushi rolls here.  Their fish is fresh, dishes are simple, and presentation is beautiful.  Service is kind and fast.  Plus, the space is very inviting.  I love the wood.  And I love the complimentary tea, with refills.  And JAPANESE TOILET! ;)
Anthony G.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}4}7/14/2016}My Wife and I have been going here for years. Attentive waitstaff, fantastic food and we love that it's down a flight of stairs and below street level--if you're lucky you can get the seat by the window. A NYC hidden gem. The best Japanese food in the East Village...
Jess B.}Queens, NY}65}31}0}-1}4}7/14/2016}Wow, was this place good! I highly recommend the  Ara Grouper Usuzukuri, it was beautifully plated and extremely delicious. The rolls are on the smaller side but the eel and the yellow tail with scallions were so fresh.  If you're looking to have something besides saki alcohol wise with your dinner you may be out of luck here, they don't have a full bar besides what they list on the menu. Otherwise the beer selection is very good!
Kate C.}Flushing, NY}10}43}102}-1}4}7/5/2016}Great place for Dinner,  they open at 5.30 n pm. Nice decor, simple but so traditional. The service was great. The food was amazing. We order Eel don and Organic Salmon don. Perfect taste , you don't even need soy sauce. Highly recommended.
Aggie H.}New York, NY}69}123}162}-1}4}6/16/2016}This sushi spot is somewhat obscure since it's downstairs and pretty small, making it ideal for dates rather than large groups. We decided upon the sushi for 2, which came with the standard appetizer of a miso soup or salad w/ ginger dressing. While I love sashimi, I'll admit I'm horrible at identifying the different types of fish but each piece was definitely fresh and delicious! To finish off our meal, they served green tea. Total came out to be ~$35pp after tax/tip, which I think was fair for the service and quality of the food.
Hit U.}New York, NY}1}785}0}-1}4}5/25/2016}Thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi, the sushi was decent.  Had the Zuisen and this really made the meal excellent. The miso soup must be a red version because it was richer in flavor compared to regular miso, this I also enjoyed. Waitstaff is super accomodating during weekday lunch.
Monica L.}Manhattan, NY}26}149}226}18}3}5/24/2016}Went for late dinner and ordered:- a miso soup: good but little salty- chawan mushi (I am very in loce of this dish, I always order it if it's in the menu!) this one was super tasty and smooth. Love it- couple of rolls: california and one with salmon. They both were really niceOverall very good quality of the food and good service.Maybe a little pricey for the small portions you get...They serve you a cup of tea by the end of the meal.
Shaan B.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}2}5/13/2016}Was told 40 minutes wait, they called after an hour, which I understand. Though don't understand that it took them nearly 10 minutes to pay attention to me at the host stand to put my name down. They called after an hour so we came back. So far have watched the waitress seat her friends who were below us on the list and another waitress move her two top to our three seats at the bar. Have been waiting an additional 30 minutes. Giving up and going somewhere else
Mike W.}New York, NY}1}2}0}-1}2}5/7/2016}Ordered sushi and sashimi combination on the new (more expensive) menu. For $30 it is a disappointment.
Laurence P.}Clinton Hill, NY}18}7}0}-1}3}5/1/2016}We had organic salmon rice bowl, Omesake and couple of drinks for little over $100 for two persons. Food: Organic salmon was little over cooked, rice was dry. 50$ Omesake was just okay, the quality of fish was rather disappointing. rice was over-seasoned and overpower the flavor. Service:Service at the door with a woman who seems to be a manger of the place was pretty bad. Just  rude for no reason from entering. Even for nyc standard, it was odd. Maybe just busy Saturday night thing, not sure. (Other staffs at the table were friendly and very attentive though.)Would I go back? Probably not.
MJ A.}Paramus, NJ}2}28}388}-1}5}4/22/2016}Always love coming here for years. Small place but good for a group of 6 or so. Sushi is always fresh and as authentic as it gets. Simple and delicious. Everyone is so friendly and service is great. Casual attire. Noise level is fine for good conversation.
Tiffany F.}New York, NY}507}77}2}-1}5}4/13/2016}Really enjoyed my meal here. The miso soup was great, fresh sushi, and the eel over rice was amazing!! Cant wait to come back!
Wei T.}New York, NY}15}84}37}-1}4}4/12/2016Updatedreview}The grilled fish head (striped bass) was great!! The steak was very delicious too... The duck soba was tasty as well.... Hnnnn I just wanna say I'll come back again and try the sushi bar!
Annie R.}Washington, DC}0}19}6}-1}5}4/9/2016}Difficult to choose from the great options. Excellent, fresh food is served with pride. And all the staff are helpful, attentive. On recent visit, I had Nabeyaki Udon & my 8-yr old had Soba Set with Salmon Oyako. We both loved our meals. And the green tea flows-- the waitstaff circulate the cozy space with a large pot for frequent refills. Love it!!!
Ms F.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}0}24}3}-1}4}4/3/2016}Really nice. I've eaten here twice = for dinner and lunch. It's light. I had the teriyaki salmon - with real teriyaki sauce that isn't sticky. Their grilled fish is amazing.
Suyoung C.}Columbia, SC}23}5}1}-1}1}3/30/2016}If the food is great I don't care about service. But food itself was so bad and plus service is aweful. I ordered some udon. And that is extremely salty. Asked some hot water to make that soup less salty. But even though I poured one cup of the water soup is still super salty. I went to Japan before I tried so many kind of udon and Japanese food. This food is in my worst 5 Japanese food in my life. It was a Japanese resturant without any Japanese customers, I could see why.
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}3/19/2016}Elegant Japanese food place with amazing sushi and cha-soba sets.Upon entering through a small wooden door, the new world I entered immediately bring me to Japan - Simple and natural wooden decorations, jazz music playing in the background, quiet yet agreeable atmosphere.My friend ordered eel over rice ($22 with salad and miso soup) and I ordered cha-soba set ($18). It contains salad, main dish over rice and hot/cold soba. The salad dressing is amazing - rich, a little sour with great aroma (Tastes like sesame, thousands island sauce plus some secret ingredients!), which really opened up my appetite. My main dish is delish seared salmon and salmon roe over sushi rice, hot soba, and plum marinated veggies. The seared salmon is rich, tender - one of the best I've ever had. The hot cha-soba is hearty made, coming with slightly sour soup and spinach and scallions on top. The noodle contains good amount of cha-aroma. I also tried my friend's eel over rice - eel is super tender and fatty. Lastly, a perfect ending - hot tea to waken us from the satisfaction of this delish meal.The price is really fair given the fantastic quality of the meal and the satisfaction I had. I would see myself come back more often to try other dishes.
Harucus S.}Storrs, CT}0}8}0}-1}4}3/13/2016}eel rice is really good.miso soup has a unique taste here, I think it's very different from the miso soup from other places
Hungryhungry H.}New York, NY}1}6}0}-1}4}2/29/2016}Very good Japanese spot in east village. Went on a Sunday in middle of afternoon because was only sushi spot open at that time and it did not disappoint. Opted for lunch special; raw tuna and sushi rice in a bowl and warm soba noodles. Raw tuna was tasty And soba noodles were good. Also quality saki. Want to return to try sushi.
Jingizban K.}Manhattan, NY}51}242}121}-1}4}2/26/2016}Passed by this place tens of times and never noticed it; this time I saw the charming crowded basement bar. The place is small crowded in a very charming way, eating at the bar is a great experience. The food was bit pricy nonetheless was great. The service was very friendly and good. Overall a good experience
Kyle Tweil K.}New York, NY}167}62}43}-1}4}1/31/2016}What do you do when you craving for a good sushi but doens't feel like to spend lots of money on food? I go to Hasaki. Seriously, they got their omakase price for $38 for lunch, $48 for dinner. Despite the fact that I never like their special(or weird) taste of miso soup, I always love to have a meal from this place as they do serve a good quality of sushi. I am sure that it wouldn't be too much to say that this could be one of the best value sushi in Manhattan. Itamae exactly knows what he's doing. Their stuff is not super fresh compare to other places who demands over $100/$150 for omakase yet still good enough to be called as fresh. And Itamae likes to apply yuzu-citrus flavors on some of pieces to give little it little acidity and refreshing taste on the piece of fish which could be little fishy in general. I would call it very good technique as most of pieces become very enjoyable. They know how to treat, and enhance their ingredient to explode its potential to maximum. This is most part that I love about them as I see many effort they are trying to put on each piece. You get one by one piece when you sat on sushi bar and each piece made with those highly trained skill. Always enjoying their omakase and will continue to do so.
Mark C.}Brooklyn, NY}318}272}1550}-1}4}1/23/2016}This was about the Salmon!Also got into the Hijiki seaweed which is a cool texture and taste, the salmon came out with the $10 Koshihikari Echigo Rice lager beer and they paired GREAT together, it's a big bottle so get it....with the teriyaki salmon!
Kelly W.}Industrial Park, MA}63}4}3}-1}1}1/14/2016}I have been here for so many times. I decided not going to this place anymore from now on! Ordered omekase sashimi for 2.The quality of the fish is so bad!! Fishes are with bones and tasted so un-fresh. Waiters were delivering the plate over customers head. Unbelievable!!!
Yiwen Z.}Honolulu, HI}160}224}604}18}4}1/4/2016}wondered around with friends and ended up here for lunch. soba combo is great, for 20some you get rice and soba noodles. everything was flavorful and well made. place was tiny but cute and well decorated, just go early to skip the line. ordered tempura as well and it was crispy and light. only thing is I ended up not feeling too well after lunch,  felt a bit nauseous that I sometimes get from dashi stock at certain places, not sure why but it could be just me.
Alex S.}Manhattan, NY}447}26}1}-1}2}12/29/2015}How quickly things can go from pacific (fresh catches) to horrific?Let me preface this all by saying we are native manhattanites as well as frequent and experienced sushi eaters. We sat at the sushi bar and immediately were scolded by a cranky sushi chef for arranging our chopsticks, soy sauce, and personal affects in a way that was deemed offensive (simply because it was not in his order) by the scowling chef. Mega awkward.... But we stayed anyway.... I ordered a "natto" roll, fully aware that it is a fermented soybean, generally rejected by the CAUCasian palate. I was quickly reviled for this. Wielding his giant knife, the malevolent Jason Vorhees of sushi chefs turned to his compadres and laughed the most evil of laughs, exclaiming "Natto!! Natto!!" As if to say, "this stupid girl has no idea what's coming next." ....at this point I should have just said "keep the rolls" and rollllllllllled out.... But we stayed....What came next was a tuna roll full of tendons (not cool...), fresh rolls stuffed sadistically with wasabi (my mom thought he was trying to kill her), a slew of dirty looks, side glances, and plates flung in our direction with a heaping side of disdain, and many suspicious laughs as he prepared orders. We're not stupid and we won't be coming back.Thank all of the Gods that I didn't order Omakase (chefs choice) and put my fate in his hands.
Ben F.}Ann Arbor, MI}0}13}0}-1}5}12/9/2015}Hasaki is dank sushi at regular sushi prices. This unsophisticated jersey boy does declare that it is the best sushi I've tried. Go for it
Jenny W.}New York, NY}20}595}133}-1}2}11/28/2015}I'm surprised by all the positive reviews because I was pretty disappointed by my meal here. Got the chirashi for lunch and I found most of the fish was not very fresh, generally tasting quite fishy. The only fish slices I could finish were the salmon and mackerel. I did enjoy the tamago though. My friend also got a soba set and noted that the soba tasted a bit funky. All in all, reasonably priced Japanese food, but unfortunately the price reflects the lowered quality because the food isn't quite as fresh. I was very unimpressed and would much preferred to have gone to any of the other Japanese restaurants in the area.
Philip B.}Palo Alto, CA}18}46}5}-1}4}10/27/2015}I spent quite a long time looking for a good sushi bar in the East Village. Sure, if you search for "best sushi" you'll find lots of places, but most of them require a reservation well in advance and will cost you $100+ per person. I just wanted a casual place with good sushi without paying a fortune. If that's what you're looking for then go to Hasaki.We arrived around 7 pm and the place was busy but not completely full, so we managed to get a table for two immediately and were promptly welcomed by our waiter.We ordered the sushi and sashimi combination for two, which included the basics (shrimp, salmon, yellow tail, etc..). It also included toro and eel (two of my favorites). My friend ordered extra snow crab sushi, while I ordered the most important piece: uni. I have to say, the uni was perfect! It was easily the best part of the meal.
Peter S.}Manhattan, NY}2}71}1}-1}4}10/22/2015}Very busy restaurant.  The center of dining here isn't really the sushi bar, and sushi may not be the focus, but nonetheless the $100 omakase combination sushi/sashimi I did was outstanding.  Only reason I give 4 stars rather than 5 is that the chef doesn't serve sushi prepared piece by piece, but rather he places the entire course on a plate before serving in one shot.  Not a fan of that and I pay premium for Manhattan omakase, because I want personal preparation.Ambience - Very busy restaurant at 830PM on a Wednesday night, even with the Mets playing off against the Cub and a lot of locals watching the game.  Some may call this restaurant cozy, I can call it cramped  But no complaints about the ambience.The food - $100 omakase, sushi and sashimi combination.  Started off with miso soup;  they offer you a choice of salad or miso.  Go with the miso.  It's unusual in that it's reddish in color; very rich in flavor; and I tasted slight burning?  I think this was deliberate, but added and enriched the flavor.The sashimi was plated very well with ornaments.  (I'm not a big fan of ornaments; very wasteful.  Give me an extra piece of fish instead.)  Two kinds of tuna for 5 pieces total; saba; one sweet shrimp; two pieces of clam; two pieces of salmon; and two other varieties of fish for 5 pieces total.  And they threw in a giant prawn head which they deep fried for me toward the end of the sashimi  It was yummy and very good in terms of portion.  A very good sashimi course.The sushi course was 8 pieces of sushi, 6 roll pieces, and 2 tamago pieces.  The tamago pieces were a bit too firm and driy.  But the sushi pieces were very good.  Only complaint was that the uni was a bit beat up and I tasted sour-ness?  Not sure about the uni.  The color seemed a little bit off as well, reddish versus the yellowish I would expect.Alcohol prices were very reasonable.  $6 for Japanese beer and they had plenty of shochu and sake at the affordable to middle range in terms of prices in various serving sizes.  The drink menu with descriptions for the sake and shochu were very useful.Would I hit this place again?  Yes.  Is it my first choice in the East Village?  No.
Cristene G.}Kennett Square, PA}10}3}0}-1}4}10/21/2015}Fast, fresh, yum.  Loved the spicy tuna rolls, the king crab was fresh, the fatty tuna app was delicious.  three people all loved their food.
Jeanie C.}Chicago, IL}42}215}3}-1}5}10/6/2015}Easily the best lunch deal in the EV by far.Hasaki is my favorite regular sushi spot in the EV because it has the freshest, high quality fish without breaking the bank. It's a classy place that even when packed with patrons feels zen-like.I highly recommend coming for lunch as it's quite a steal! The cha-soba set with chirashi is what I usually order ($18). But the afternoon plate and flower garden platter is also very good.The tamago here is divine. The service is sharp and attentive. It's high quality in every way, and a great place for dates or to bring out-of-town guests.
Sylvan J.}Sault Ste. Marie, MI}4}7}3}-1}5}9/29/2015}Great sushiMust try the Garlic Beef appetizer and the $52 dollar sushi for 2, the Eel on that platter was yummy.
marjorie c.}Highland, NY}5}22}11}-1}5}9/24/2015}Excellent Omakase selection by Sushi chef. I really enjoyed the tuna maki. The fish was super fresh. The only thing not amazing was the miso soup, too salty. Get the salad instead, the ginger dressing is very good. Great table service.
Edie C.}Brooklyn, NY}19}50}0}-1}5}9/19/2015}not expensive price ,but totally nice dishes.However,must make a reservation,otherwise,you need to wait more than 40 mins

Katherine F.}Austin, TX}678}202}39}18}5}9/15/2015}I haven't done nearly enough justice to the little row of Japanese restaurants near my home. I had a serious hankering for Japanese over the weekend, and I'm here to report back. This location is tiny and adorable. It's super quiet, with a dignified and calm air that is rather atypical for a place this close to St. Marks. It's easy to miss, since it's submerged at the half-basement level. It's right next to 212 Hisae's.The cha-soba/chirashi (or salmon) bowls are amazing, and such a good deal for lunch/weekends. $18 for a full bowl of soba in pleasantly umami-flavored clear broth, plus a small bowl of sushi rice with fresh fish? Please and please! I would probably give them a solid 4.5, and the price definitely tipped my meal into the 5-star range. We also had the matcha and black sesame ice creams, both of which were pleasantly flavored. I actually like Japanese green tea quite a bit, but the sesame flavor was so rich and bold I have to say that turned out to be my favorite. A really stellar deal for the price point. I tried to go back yesterday but it unfortunately was closed at 4 p.m. on a Monday. :|
Lils Y.}Manhattan, NY}191}231}175}-1}5}9/9/2015}The BF and I came on a weekday for lunch here and were impressed. Plenty of seating available ~12:30pm, good service, food was even better. 1) Afternoon Plate - fried vegetable tempura, sushi (6 pc tuna roll, w/ sashimi on the side), grilled salmon, and miso soup. $18. Everything tasted fresh and great. Would get this again.2) Chirashi - sliced fish on rice w/ side of soba. The BF liked this.Don't waste your time at Sharaku on the same block. Spend more and come here instead for signicantly better food.
Marina S.}Brooklyn, NY}341}318}780}18}4}8/28/2015}Beautiful little basement sushi joint in the East Village; I actually walked right past it before I even realized it was there. While it's a little pricey compared to the other cheap izakayas and sushi bars in the St. Marks area, Hasaki definitely delivers.I came in for lunch and tried the Chirashi / Cha-soba set ($18), which came with a beautiful mini chirashi bowl, salad, pickles, and your choice of hot or cold green tea soba noodles. If you're like me and always feel compelled to photograph everything you eat, don't worry; Hasaki's presentation is gorgeous and totally instaworthy (and now I hate myself for using that word).The sashimi was extremely fresh and melted in my mouth, and was perfectly complemented by their fresh wasabi root (not horseradish!), pickled ginger (which was very light and not pungent at all), and sushi rice. The set came with a mountain of soba noodles (I chose cold), which were also very refreshing. Despite their bright green color they don't really taste like green tea, but were delicious all the same.With complementary hot green tea at the end, Hasaki was definitely a welcome reprieve. It's serene in the basement and perfect for dropping out of the hustle of the city for a relaxing and delicious lunch.
East V.}Manhattan, NY}0}35}0}-1}4}8/20/2015}We live in the East Village and this is our spot. We also like Yuba, too, and Kanoyama, but this is our favorite. Freshest sushi, which is not so much my thing, but it is very much my other half's thing, and he loves it. Just keep an eye out if your waiter suggests a new fish that just came in. Could be pricy!Also, great cooked stuff, which is more my thing. I like the salmon with lemon and pepper -- so tasty and crispy skin. Also love the chicken with sansho pepper. The salad dressing is to die for. I am tempted to drink the stuff! Agedashi tofu is great, too. Really, it's all great.That said, I guess I wouldn't say it's a particularly friendly place. You're not going to get a big grin from anyone who works here. But, for someone who lives in New York, having food served in a no-big-deal kinda way is actually very nice.
Katherine B.}West New York, NJ}165}144}177}18}4}8/20/2015}Quaint location. Place has been here forever. Love the service and love the sushi. Definitely a place to come to late at night.
Mel L.}New York, NY}1}36}26}-1}4}8/14/2015}Quality of food was good. Sashimi was very fresh. Service was ok. A little pricey. Overall enjoyed the dining experience.
Jin Y.}Brooklyn, NY}6}732}2358}-1}4}8/11/2015}I came here for their Twilight Dinner Prix Fixe, which is available until 6 PM. They open at 5:30 and you really have 30 minutes to order it, which I thought was silly. They should extend the time to 6:30 or 7 PM. I've been to another Japanese establishment with a similar early dinner special and it goes on until 7 PM. This place is in a semi basement with plain wooden décor, very casual spot. The set comes with Miso Soup, Salad, Sashimi or Sushi, Tempura, Grilled Fish and Dessert for ($22). The miso soup was different from other miso soup I've had. It was a red color. Not an expert with miso soup, but I prefer the regular clear color one. The salad had a unique dressing. Not the dressing you usually get at other places. But I prefer the regular dressing. We ordered the sashimi set and the sushi set. The sashimi cuts were on the thin side.  You get like a total of 7 pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. For the sushi you get 3 pieces of sushi, the same 3 types of fish mentioned above and a tuna roll. Loved the tempura of vegetables and shrimp that you dip into the sauce that they give it. The grilled fish was salmon. Plus you get 3 side dishes too, that's not mentioned in the set description. So it's a lot of food and worth the price you're paying. I was hoping for ice cream for dessert, but it was just fruits.
Paul K.}Philadelphia, PA}99}495}37}-1}4}7/28/2015}I've probably eaten here sixty or seventy times over the last two decades.  It was as good as it gets back when eating raw fish was considered strange and is as good as it gets now that the ocean called and is running out of fish.Hey, review #420. That is, like, totally awesome.
Mike L.}Flushing, NY}84}5}0}-1}3}7/22/2015}I am assuming those who are giving this place 5 stars are the students in NYU that have no idea what good sushi is. The service was mediocre, the shrimp in omakase sushi/sashimi for two was rather fishy, and we were busy killing mosquitoes while trying to enjoy our meal. Overall, very average and not worth the high price. I expected a pleasant experience.
karin L.}Los Angeles, CA}0}45}0}-1}5}7/17/2015Updatedreview}We keep coming back. The food is SO good. The service is good. Love it. Can't count how many times we've been. Our children love it, too. So happy it stays in business--but is pretty much always full and often with long waits, so I think we're safe.
Larry C.}Essex Fells, NJ}35}125}161}-1}5}7/2/2015Updatedreview}Been coming back a few time and have not been disappointed, food and services have been good, love the waitress she is very respectful and friendly.
Allison P.}Columbus, OH}14}37}15}-1}5}6/12/2015}Loves it here! Just dined here for the first time this week and the sushi was great! It's a little expensive, however it's work the extra $.
Vera M.}Manhattan, NY}1}8}0}-1}5}5/23/2015}If you want to wow your family take them here! I took my Mom, as she loves sushi & she's been talking about it for almost a year. The tuna roll with no rice instead cucumber, shrimp and ginger is pure heaven. Seaweed lovers do yourself a favor and get the seaweed salad, there are 4 different kids of seaweed, including white, so special! Enjoy it!
Elsa G.}Manhattan, NY}95}140}47}-1}2}5/14/2015}I came there but I ordered to take away so maybe it didn't help but I was disappointed.I love Chirashi so for a $26 I was expected a delicious one but it was far from my expectations :(
Caroline S.}Los Angeles, CA}451}49}54}-1}5}5/2/2015}Lunch special sets are so worth. Best. tempura. ever. Sushi deluxe set filled me up to the brink.If only I was rich, Id go there every day...
Bee G.}New York, NY}0}144}24}-1}5}4/19/2015}Fresh as can be! Loved the chef's choice sushi - subtle combination of complementary flavors. Wonderful staff, friendly feeling in the room, plus robopot :)
Dina M.}Manhattan, NY}25}94}20}-1}3}4/17/2015}Had high expectations based on the crowd and reviews but it was just ok. They have red miso soup, which I love. We got sushi for 2. $52 but nothing to write home about. Average fish, nothing special. Nice Ambience.
Clara L.}Oakland Gardens, NY}2}3}0}-1}4}3/19/2015}Loved, loved, loved their chef's choice sushi selection! We didn't have a reservation, but managed to get seated at the sushi bar in about 15 minutes on a Friday night, which was extremely surprising. The selection was about 8 pieces of sushi and a final roll. We had the chef serve each one after it was made instead of all at once. I definitely liked our decision since it gave a sense of anticipation for the next piece and it also allowed enough time to savor the piece we just had. Each was one divine!! I most distinctly recall the raw shrimp piece as it had me reminiscing about the drunken live shrimp I used to eat at Chinese restaurants in Flushing (they don't serve them anymore..anywhere). We also ordered a bottle of sake which complimented our experience very well. Props to their sushi chefs!
Jessica O.}Manhattan, NY}11}39}49}-1}3}3/14/2015Updatedreview}We tried Omakase Sushi and Sashimi. Omakase sashimi was okay but nothing to be frilled about. The quality was good but it was pretty much an average for omakase. Omakase sushi, however, was a bit disappointing. Overall, our experience was worth 3.5 stars concerning food, ambience, and service. I will probably save my money for omakase for other places and stick with cheaper food for hasaki.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}4}3/8/2015}Dine in alone for dinner6:30PMTokuju Chirashi ($48) - wonderful!- the variety of freshest fish with its different textures were terrific. Uni was sweet and melted in my mouth. Ikura bursted out the juice from the salty eggs were tasty. Three spiced Chu-Toro melted in my mouth. Fatty yellowtail (Buri) were buttery, rich flavor and was sumptuous mouth-feel.  The dark sweet pickles topping that was between the bed of rice gave soft sweetness to the toppings (sashimi) and rice. That harmony was irresistible. I was asked by my waiter after I finish my medium size sweet shrimp that I would like to have my shrimp head fried or not. That unexpected surprise gave a big smile. Simply placed fried shrimp head was on a Japanese paper with a plate. A slice of lemon that came with was artistically created and my freshly fried shrimp was delicious with some coarse salt. Sansho (Sichuan numbing pepper) was offered to add to Aka-miso (red miso) soup was my first. My Japanese waiter said working here gave many chances to try new things. The pepper slightly elevated the flavor of the soup. If you didn't get the pepper, do ask for it.
Brian F.}Manhattan, NY}1}16}0}-1}4}2/24/2015}I come here quite a bit with my girlfriend and we both enjoy it. The service is fast and very friendly. The food is good and comes out rather quickly. I don't think this place is revered for its sushi quite like some other restaurants in the city but I've thoroughly enjoyed every roll/piece I've tried. Very delicious, fresh tasting sushi for a fair price. We normally split a couple rolls of sushi and the Kamonan Soba (sliced duck in hot broth) and both leave full and happy. Nice interior setup, neither casual nor fancy, sort of right in the middle, which makes it a good first or second date spot if you live in the East Village.
Monica T.}New York, NY}2941}214}2018}18}3}2/23/2015}Salty rolls on the small side with too much rice for my liking.  Tuna looked like excellent quaity tho.
Osaka B.}Jersey City, NJ}12}64}4}-1}3}2/7/2015}This place has been around for forever.  I went about two weeks back.  It was years since I was last there.  I went on a Sunday.  My friend really wanted sushi.  Normally eating sushi on a Sunday is a big no no because they can't have fresh fish delivered But anyway.  We wentThe FoodThe sushi was nothing to scream about.  The fish was fresh.  We ordered a sushi sashimi set for two. I ordered the sea eel as a side.   The regular eel taste better.  I was kind of surprised.  Try the Koshihikari Eichigo Beer.  I've never seen it anywhere else.  The beer is brewed with rice grain, if my memory serves me correctly.   It was delicious!!!The PlaceThey have a Japanese toilet with the heated seat and spray jets.  So if you ever wanted to try one.  This is where you can do it.  The restaurant is ordinary looking.  No frills.  It's on a side street.  Down a flight of stairs.  Up the block from a sake bar called Decibel.  So if you want to continue drinking after eating and get some snack food, you could always head down the block.  The StaffNothing too impressive here.  Our waiter was a bit slow with our pre-dinner drinks.  He basically did his job.  The place is pretty small.  The wait staff are usually standing there peeping at you.  So it's not hard to get their attention.  Someone said the staff is racist.  I didn't think so.  I went with a friend and we sat there for probably 2 hours.  We ate, drank, and were merry.  I didn't really feel anything negative coming from the staff.  It was a slow night though.  I could sense that there might be some pressure from management to turn the tables over in a timely manner if it was busy.  So that could of been what happened, but then again maybe not.  Perhaps the individual they complained about wasn't there.The PriceTypical.  For two drinks.  Two desserts.  Sushi Sashimi for two.  And 2 sea eels and some extra rolls I shelled out 151.00.  That includes the tip.  I tipped them 20% or so.
Alexander H.}Manhattan, NY}380}348}140}-1}4}2/6/2015}The trouble with New York restaurants as it approaches 3pm, most restaurants will be shutting its door around 2:30pm for dinner prep or a quick snooze for its wait staff. I'm not complaining that restaurants should be open from lunch to dinner service, however Hasaki made an exception for us. This alone is worthy of a star.On such a cold winter day, we were quickly drawn to the soba and chirashi lunch set. Prices were reasonable and the food was surprisingly tasty. I hope they didn't mind me slurping my broth away. =P
Milo A.}New York, NY}33}6}0}-1}5}1/25/2015}Ive been coming to Hasaki for the past 15 years and thought it was time to let people know how good it really is. Hasaki rivals Nobu and Morimotos hands down - for a fraction of the cost. Great salad dressing, unmatched sumai and THE BEST SUSHI AROUND. Do yourself a favor and check out this small, authentic part of Japan in NYC.
David F.}Jersey City, NJ}515}191}8}-1}3}1/23/2015}Hasaki is one of my favorite sushi spots in the city. However, their concern for their customers is a bit underwhelming, as the other night I almost swallowed a piece of wire about an inch long that somehow got inside my scallop roll. At first I thought it was a bone, but when I finally coughed it up, it was a piece of black metal wire. The management was so mortified at this dangerous slip-up, they gave me the entire roll on the house. That's sarcastic. If one of your employees accidentally lets a piece of metal get in your food, I think it warrants a bit more than a free $6 roll. I also emailed their website and so far no response. Very upset as it used to be our favorite place.
Patrice J.}JAMAICA, NY}0}7}0}-1}1}1/22/2015Updatedreview}I think this place is extremelyUnfortunate . The tall Asian waiter was clearly racist, as my partner and I were the only people of a different race together in the restaurant.One: took too long to bring me my order, 20 minutes is too long to me for some raw veggie rolls. Didn't listen to my other two orders. So he forgot those and didn't even apologize for it. Sad. Didn't listen to my partner discussing what drink he wanted.Brought us the check before us even asking for it. Which is huge no no . The greeter comes up to us while we are eating to ask us are we done. We were still eating. so obviously we aren't done. They didn't ask anyone else in the restaurant if they were done or harassed them. The waiter constantly gave me unwanted eye contact but couldn't personally tell me that my food was delayed. I really feel like this place is truly racist because we felt like we were being pushed out while ask the staff on the floor gawked at us while we finished our green teas.As we left the greeter came outside to ask us if there was a problem with the service. I told her very bluntly yes the waiter was forgetful un apologetic and disrespectful. So I won't be returning because of your obviously racially biased attitudes. We are paying customers, leave your bigotry at the door and do better.

Frank B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}1/16/2015}We had a terrible meal at this restaurant last night. The miso soup was not edible. A very strange form of miso and not a good or clean taste. it is a cliche but honestly it tasted like dishwater. The shrimp dumplings were also barely edible and the fried tofu was fine because you can't mess up tofu that badly, but the sauce was terrible. The spinach dish was likewise poor quality. I recommend avoiding this restaurant.
Nelson W.}New York, NY}440}535}923}18}4}12/28/2014}Sandwiched between a slew of mediocre Japanese restaurants seemingly with the sole aim of enticing a student population deprived of disposable income, Hasaki stands out with its quality traditional Japanese entrées and fresh sashimi in a chic yet somewhat hidden with a lower-level entrance. One of the best testaments of a quality Japanese establishment would be actual Japanese patrons dining in the restaurant. With that, Hasaki passes the quality test. As a fanatic of Japanese fare, Hasaki is best experienced with a series of small dishes with a combination of sashimi, cooked meats, and chilled vegetables. Personal favorites include chawanmushi, sashimi mini-plate, tuna with grated yams (seasonal), oshinko, and the age tofu. Service is a bit inconsistent at times, but the food is definitely worth the wait. Hasaki has been around for awhile (1984), and they know what they are doing.
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}4}12/16/2014}As a I was walking next to my good looking queen... I glanced upon a castle that had black and white designs... I looked into the window and saw tons of happy people... Then I became a little jealous... Went inside and ordered some omakase and nattoo rolls which were very good and not mellow.Alright... I'm done with my poem.I love Hasaki(I keep saying Hisaki in my head tho). This place will always be kept in my memory as the lucky spot we stumbled upon. I wanted omakase, sushi, anything Japanese. My girlfriend and I were walking and looking so we entered this place and were very surprised by the omakase and natto roll we had.The fish, the EVERYTHING in this damn omakase was amazing. Right amount of wasabi and sauce, the tuna filler roll was so freaking good... SO GOOD. We also got uni and it was very very good. I highly recommend it, like seriously, like Gaga.
Norman L.}West Village, Manhattan, NY}3}25}0}-1}5}12/4/2014}The East Village is littered with sushi bars/restaurants, but Hasaki stands out. The sushi is excellent, and well worth the price (which doesn't even compare to NYC's high-end sushi restaurants). This is not half-off sushi, nor does it taste like it. The staff is knowledgable, if a bit cool, but my only real complaint is the insanely bright lighting. Were the lighting dimmer, I would recommend Hasaki as an ideal first date restaurant - assuming both people on said first date eat fish, and like it raw. I have never once been disappointed. In fact, I have never once left feeling anything but extremely satisfied.
Michele H.}Manhattan, NY}2}87}71}-1}2}11/2/2014}I really wish I can un-go to this place. I should've just walked out when I saw a "I hate my job" look on my waiter's face. He pretty much ruined my experience at that point but I decided to stay and try their sushi. What was I thinking! The sushi was just ok. I've had much better sushi at Kanoyama, my usual go-to spot. When we were done with our food, the waiter signaled me to pass him our used plates like you would signal a dog to get you your slippers #RUDE
David N.}Brooklyn, NY}121}573}801}18}4}10/22/2014}Dinner on Japanese row oh where oh where do we go? Hasaki merrily we go. This quaint restaurant in the East Village with wood interior to lend the air of entering a world of tami mats and shoji screens. The hot towel to clean. The service polite and quick. The food sushi & sashimi platter was good. Not too much rice and enough fish on top. The Chirashi bowl had a good selection of fish and usual assortment that comes with it.Hasaki lends itself to the neighbor showcasing quality sushi.
Benjamin H.}Manhattan, NY}3}33}0}-1}4}10/18/2014}Top quality fish.  simple not overdressed sushi.  great stuff
Theodore K.}Manhattan, NY}16}22}1}-1}4}10/16/2014}Each time my friend and I have come to Hasaki for dinner, we've always been pleased with the service and food. The waitstaff are always helpful, courteous and patient.  The restaurant can be a li'l noisy during the evening hours, but that is simply out of one's control and not a fault of the restaurant.  If you'd like a less noisy spot, I'd recommend a table in the front, instead of the middle or back. The dishes that we tend to order regularly:  the Hijiki seaweed salad - flavorful and delicious; shrimp + vegetable tempura - texture/panko is wonderfully light and crisp; rainbow trout special - a li'l on the salty side, but tasty and delicious nonetheless.Some noted pluses:  the staff who freshly prepare the sushi/sashimi are all Japanese, and native Japanese folk seem to frequent the place in regular, consistent numbers, as well.
Alberto B.}New York, NY}0}4}1}-1}5}10/9/2014}15 years coming here and never ever had to complain, consistency at its best !Best spicy tuna roll in town and try the koshihikari Beer...pure bliss
Erin Y.}Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY}2}37}2}-1}4}10/8/2014}I've been disappointed with their sushi, but they definitely got the best lunch sets in this area! The Afternoon plate is absolutely my favorite, a combo of sushi, salmon fillet, salad, great tempura, couple small vege dishes and fruits at the end!! Everything in this plate is great! But, don't order the fancy sushi plate, for some reason, their punch sushi quality is not good, sometimes the rice even don't stick together, that's something they really should care about considering they are actually a sushi restaurant.
Patrick W.}New York, NY}227}178}701}-1}4}9/8/2014}Sunday dinner with two old high school friends. We went with the Combination of Sushi & Sashimi for Three. This is not on the menu but if you ask them for it, they'll gladly do it.The fish here is really fresh and just melts in your mouth. You don't get that toughness when you bite into it, it's cut just right. We got six pieces of oh toro as a supplement.There's a lot of choices in the area but I thought it was very good. A bit pricier than some other places but not too bad, you're getting quality fish.Really courteous wait staff and helpful.
Evan L.}Irvine, CA}30}18}9}-1}3}8/14/2014}I love sushi and have had a lot of terrific sushi in my life. As a result I've tuned my visual, olfactory and gustatory equipment for the very purpose of consuming these little, delightfully delicious morsels of fish and rice. To my finely-tuned senses, Hasaki's sushi was good, but did not pass the bar that separates the merely good from the very good or great. I ordered their omakase which cost about $48; not a bad price for an omakase. However, I must point out there are other places in New York City that have better quality fish and better prepared sushi rice at a similarly competitive price point. Hasaki's sushi was served a tad bit too warm. The rice they used had a grainy, loose texture. The uni left a light stink on my tongue; not the fresh taste of the sea that I expect from fresh uni. I noticed they serve a lot of pre-cooked shrimp nigiri; there was no fresh amaebi in sight. But to their credit they did serve a very fatty, delicious Toro. Overall, I felt Hasaki had merely OK sushi coupled with above-average service. Three stars.

Sam Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}0}-1}2}7/25/2014}Way overpriced dishes all round with tiny portions. Go if you have the dough and if you expect to be full after dinner, expect to spend in the hundreds. $52.00 for Sushi for Two? With sushi so TINY that even two children would still be hungry afterwards!!! Beware of the seaweed salad too where you could only get a couple of bites out of it! Don't get me started with the other dishes that we got as well. I have never spent so much money on a dinner where we were left still hungry!!! First time there because the B-Day girl picked the place and my other friend who shared the bill with me would never go back. We predict if we spent $200+, we would be able to leave full and somewhat satisfied.For prices like that, Tomoe Sushi on Thompson Street is the place to go where the food is always good, fresh and you get what you pay for and they won't empty your wallets and the best part of it, the pieces are much bigger doubling the size and you'll leave full and satisfied.
Priscilla T.}Manhattan, NY}104}580}8}18}3}7/22/2014}Totally passable but nothing special for both the food and experience. It's casual and reasonably priced and that's the experience you should expect. Miso glazed cod, cold soba, and sashimi were all pretty decent.
Elizabeth o.}New York, NY}1}21}0}-1}2}7/18/2014}Food was fine. Sushi chef was sick. Sniffling and sneezing non-stop making each bite tough to swallow.
Alison G.}Los Angeles, CA}6}24}1}-1}2}7/18/2014}Not what it used to be.  Customer service lacks existence, sushi is not much better than chain places.  Grew up eating here, was sad to see its decline.
Max T.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}3}-1}5}7/17/2014}Second time there for omakase and again, oishi-desu.  Really great stuff.  First time i tried their egg and it was amazing.  Thank you so much, we will be back again.
Debby V.}Hayfork, CA}0}12}0}-1}5}7/13/2014}I love Hasaki and this is the only sushi restaurant I ever eat in the city. They serve the best possible authentic Sushi. The stuffs are always attentive and nice. The chef is well experienced and can tell what I love. I love sitting at the counter and enjoy the daily special. From the first sip of miso soup through the entrees then dessert, it's the best place to fully treat myself and never regret.
Katie I.}Nashville, TN}134}350}876}18}4}7/5/2014}Good sign when the restaurant is almost entirely Japanese, both diners and staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Casual and reasonably priced. We started off with a tempura appetizer and this was by far the best tempura I've had. So flaky and perfectly cooked. Side salad was generous with a nice mix of greens, tomatoes and thin shreds of carrots along with their homemade ginger dressing. Red miso soup was unique and delicious.My friend's beef appetizer which was thinly sliced and perfectly tender was also very good. I went with a sushi combo which came with a about 5 nigiri pieces and 2 rolls and soup and salad. The standout was the nigiri. Holy moly, best tuna, salmon and yellowtail I've ever had. So unbelievably fresh it literally melts in your mouth. The spicy tuna roll was really good, but the yellowtail and scallion roll was almost too onion-y for me. I would come back and do nigiri and sashimi. The fish is so superb, it almost needs to stand on its own. I'm having a hard time being back home and left to our 'best' sushi. Until next time, Hasaki. I will be dreaming of the delicious sushi I had.
H W.}New York, NY}147}63}53}-1}4}6/28/2014}Sushi for 2 is stunning in appearance and flavor. Tuna nigiri was a highlight as was the yellowtail and scallion roll that it comes with. Plus you get 1 roll of choice-try the seared salmon with roe and shiso.
Elizabeth N.}Brooklyn, NY}185}601}245}18}4}6/22/2014}Their sushi dinners are a good deal! For under $30 you can get many combinations of sushi or sashimi or both. Got the sushi/sashimi combo and it included half a cucumber roll and half a tekka roll, about 6 pieces of sashimi and 6 nigiri like ebi, ikura, and unagi. Came with miso soup. Fish was pretty decent if you are craving sushi and don't want to pay a fortune.The hostess is also very sweet.
Jenna S.}Irvine, CA}5}32}92}-1}5}6/20/2014}High quality sashimi, beautifully presented entrees, and excellent customer service are what comes to mind when dining at Hasaki. I've been here on a couple of weekend lunches and the experience has always been pleasant. I highly recommend their Afternoon Plate or the Cha-Soba Set, which comes with their red miso soup.Food: Authentic Japanese (never been to Japan, so what do I know about authentic. But I'm going to claim it's authentic)Ambiance: Intimate but casual
Mai L.}New York, NY}213}367}416}-1}5}6/18/2014}This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. I always order the afternoon set which is $18 and it comes with soup, salad, dessert, sushi or sashimi, and a tempura bento box. The service is always friendly and the meal is tasty, fresh and satisfying.
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}6/4/2014}7:30pm, summer Wednesday. The wait for 3 wasn't long, but they don't seat incomplete parties even if you can order for them. I sat outside but was getting bitten alive by bugs, so moved inside. The air inside was a bit stuffy. I saw a number of tables with well-behaved children. Good job, parents. Got the summer tempura (okra, something that looked like fiddleheads, and zucchini), Chu-hi cocktail, and shared the combo sushi sashimi for 2 with a friend. The latter dish also came with two soups or salad. Decided I do not like red miso soup. The platter was good. More than enough pieces of sashimi and sushi... so fresh, buttery. I thought it was very well priced at $56. Friend got the chirashi and added scallops. If you're into chirashi, try the kaisen don at Ootoya!
Tariki A.}Manhattan, NY}0}53}113}-1}5}5/25/2014}People are very polite. I took my 9 year old nephew who wanted to try sushi. Waiter was cognizant enough to come back and ask if wasabi should be left on the side rather then on the sushi. Very thoughtful.Sushi was so fresh and the final finish with a nice cup of tea.....yum.
Dalhea K.}Austin, TX}139}144}3}-1}5}5/21/2014}This place is everything I love about eating out - amazing service and food so good it makes you want to shed a tear.  The waiters were kind, patient, and well-informed.  We had a table of 6 so it took us a while to get seated and they don't take reservations but it was worth the wait.  We ordered practically every appetizer on the menu.  The salad came with a delicious sesame dressing that I wish I could purchase to take home with us.  We had some fish head, not my thing but my friends loved it.  We got the steamed egg custard which was slightly sweet, creamy, and savory with some thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms.  The red miso soup was dark and hearty with flavor, unlike any other miso soup I've ever tasted.  The seaweed salad was beautiful but tasted like someone literally scooped seaweed out of the sea and arranged it artfully on a plate.  It straight-up tasted like the sea.  I would avoid this one.  The kanisu was average.  The tataki was ok as well.The queen of the appetizers was the GRILLED MISO COD.  You do not want to miss out on this!!!  It's incredibly flavorful and flaky, seriously I could have ordered 3 more of these and ate them all myself.  I wasn't too excited about this when someone ordered it but after tasting it I felt bad for even doubting its deliciousness.Most of us ordered sashimi for the main course.  As we expected, the fish was sliced to perfection and was incredibly fresh.  I'm only going to mention the toro (fatty tuna) because it was the best and it basically melted in your mouth.  At $8 a slice it was pricey but well worth it.  Here's a tip - order the spicy tuna roll, it's not on the menu but it's so good you wanna slap someone's momma.  The chef will refuse to make you a spicy salmon but it's all good.  I was in the mood for a roll and ordered the spicy tuna.  This isn't your typical mayo/sriracha deal, I can't figure out how the chef got the tuna to be spicy but it did not have a hint of mayo and it was lightly seasoned in an aromatic sesame oil.  I've never had a roll of spicy tuna this good.  Everyone at my table tried a piece and ended up ordering a roll for themselves.  It's that good.tl;dr - Amazing service, superb food.  Don't miss out on the grilled miso cod, toro sashimi, and the spicy tuna roll.  Trust me, I'm fat, I know what I'm talking about.
Bruce W.}New York, NY}94}83}2}-1}5}5/15/2014}Always very FRESH fish. awesome selection of hot and cold food. wonderful sushi, a step above most others. Excellent service. have been there 5+ times now, always great, leave happy. toungue-asmWONDERFUL PLACE! It's a GO-TO for sushi!!!
Eva L.}Bronx, NY}5}16}2}-1}5}5/12/2014}My experience at Hasaki was life-changing. Sexual. Amazing.Okay, maybe that's exaggerating, but I've had a lot of Americanized, mediocre, cream-cheeseified sushi in my life and this was not that. I wanted to go to a place with my partner that offered omakase, as I've never had it before (and the thought of being trusting the chefs with their discretion as to what to serve was at the very least, exciting). They did not disappoint. We went on Mother's Day, a Sunday, so I was expecting it to be a little crowded. Lo and behold, we had to wait "20 to 25 minutes" to be seated. The hostess seated a party of two that arrived after we did before my partner and I, but to quote him, "that was the most Japanese guy I've seen all day", so maybe the guy she let in had an in with the restaurant (not to mention he had his elderly mother with him). No worries, it wasn't too long of a wait until we were seated and greeted with hot towels.They seem to have a large selection of beverages, to which my partner opted for a beer. It was nice and light. We ordered the omakase for sushi and sashimi and unbeknownst to me, I was well on my way on a journey of food ecstasy. We first received our soup, a delicious red miso garnished with tofu bits and cilantro. This ain't no powdered shit here. Then, our server came out with the sashimi, which consisted of novelty items (at least, for a person who refers to my sushi preferences as "I like the red one") such as shrimp from Madagascar, octopus (chewier, but good!), a horse mackerel salad with ginger and cilantro (that got its own plate for soy sauce for dipping) served on a leaf on the fish itself, flounder from somewhere-not-here, and fatty tuna (lordjesushelpmethatwasamazing). The presentation was gorgeous enough to make the characters from The Little Mermaid bawl. And lest you think I identified the fish all by myself, the server was well informed of the food and let us know what each thing was after he set the sashimi down in front of us. The only thing I didn't really like was the shrimp heads (super super fishy and the thought of eating brains of what is basically the cockroach of the sea makes me queasy), but I ate one anyways because why would I not when I paid $120 for the meal? Then, the sushi. I'm salivating from my mouth as I reminisce about it. It was served all at once and our server once again explained what some of the lesser-known items were on the plate. My apologies here because I can't remember the specifics of the nigiri, but we had some sort of clam, salmon roe, eel that literally melts in your mouth, the tuna once again, this time marinated in soy sauce, and a white fish that was complimented by a dab of (real!!!) wasabi underneath the slice of fish. The rolls consisted of just vegetables and rice, one with cucumber and sea leaf and the other with some sort of squash. Both were delicious. Everything was delicious. We saved the tuna for last, an epic last high note on the authentically Japanese symphony that is Hasaki's omakase.I was basically in tears after our meal, as the realization hit me that that I had just experienced the sushi that I would compare all other sushi to for the rest of my life. Once my emotional breakdown was over, we were served some hot green tea and given the dessert menu. I ordered some black sesame ice cream with red bean sauce. It was great. It actually had black sesame in it. Also, the spoons were adorable.The only thing near to a complaint that I have is that the service was kind of average. This is understandable, as I'm sure they get plenty busy with the quality-to-price ratio that they offer. My server wasn't friendly by any means, but definitely attentive and didn't badger us to get on with our meal, giving us enough time to enjoy our food and certainly not negligent. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. You won't be gorging yourself on the portions, but I left feeling satisfied, not full. I also didn't die from eating raw fish--everything was fresh, clean and delicious. Sure, the $60-per-person omakase price point may off put you a tad (though I believe that's a pretty good deal in NYC for the quality I had), but they have other options that were much more affordable. They apparently also deliver and do pick-up! I'm glad I came and will be back for more.
Sara Y.}Encinitas, CA}182}60}158}-1}4}5/1/2014}This is a small token Japanese place in the east village. It is very authentic in terms of the menu and sushi. Very simple, yet offers really fresh and quality fish. This lace has simple decor and is not very ideal for large parties, but is nice to come here with family, friends, or a date.I came here for lunch last Saturday and although it wasn't too crowded when we were seating, more and more people came and were waiting at the door as the afternoon came along. The service wasn't particularly fast, so if you're looking for a grab n go, this isn't the place.The sushi was really delicious--we got the sushi and sashimi sample, which had a good variety of fish. I would recommend two of these for about three people, because it may not be enough for one person. We also got the seaweed salad which is a must get. It isn't your typical seaweed salad which is very slimy and marinated. It was all different types of seaweed ina variety of colors with a yummy mustard-like sauce on the side. The seaweed had the perfect texture--it was firm yet also crunchy and chewy at the same time. Also, it didn't get into my teeth like the typical seaweed salad. Another must-get item is the eel roll. It is marinated eel and avocado rolled in cucumber. The eel is so flavorful and the cool fresh cucumber complements the umami that you get from the fish. A very well balanced dish that is explosive with flavor and texture. Also get the masago--so flavorful as well!I really enjoyed the food in this restaurant and believe that it's one if the few authentic places in New York. It's a simple no frills type that you go for a great meal. Will definitely be coming back.
Howie L.}Warren, NJ}286}130}190}-1}4}4/5/2014}Simple no frills Japanese food that serves fresh really good tasting sushi. Can get busy fast during dinner time and they don't take reservation. Service is good. Only thing I found was that they can tend to overcook there fried salmon, so if you want it a little less than well done, let them know when ordering.
Bella W.}Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY}40}17}35}-1}3}4/4/2014}Food here is good but the service is really bad. To be honest, I've never seen a Japanese restaurant with such bad service. When I say "bad service", it doesn't mean the actress is rude-- I mean they Don't Offer You Service At All. I haven't finished the salad and the waitress came put the entree on my table. She seems simply want us guests to finish the meal ASAP and leave. She never came to our table again afterwards. She seemed indifferent and never even looked at us, or anyone. With all the heavy make-up, she thought she is beautiful and is the queen who reins. If you need more water you have to raise your hand and ask for more like a kindergarten child. I'd rather stand up and serve myself than having her fake eyelash dropped accidentally into my soba...
Zoe T.}New York, NY}105}104}5}-1}5}3/27/2014}This place has some of the most authentic, fresh and delicious Japanese cuisine you will find in New York City. Located in the East Village, this restaurant is discreetly located down stairs into a small, bamboo lined, quaint little space. Hasaki welcomes you with a warm hand towel and some of the most zen-waiters in all of NY.I am a total fanatic about knowing the places I eat raw foods, and this place can definitely be trusted time and time again for it's care and devotion to tasty, clean and reliable meals. My family has been coming here since I was young and we have yet to be anything but pleased afterwards. If you go for dinner before 6:30pm, their Twilight Dinner Sampling Plate is a perfect mix of everything and priced at only $20. Their red miso soup is a rich and smoky version of the traditional watery substance you'll get at other restaurants. Dishes not to miss are their cold and flavorful soba noodles, crunchy Agedashi tofu, tender beef & scallion negimaki, and of course their rolls. If you want a somewhat pricier, but better quality and more intimate experience, this is the place. This place delivers nothing but true, good, clean eats. See you next week, Hasaki!
Bruce G.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}4}3/23/2014}Been here three times and each time was very good. They don't take reservations but each time they quoted an accurate wait time, which is refreshing. Sushi very good and service even better. You will be rewarded for exploring the  menu and trying unusual items.
Wendy G.}Minato, Japan}238}721}1145}18}4}3/23/2014Updatedreview}This time I came during lunch time... much more enjoyable experience than last time thanks to the space. Since I was dining alone, finally the table was big enough to hold all the food, haha. Wonderful food - taste, variety, presentation were all top-notched. Besides, $18 afternoon plate lunch set might be the best deal one could find in the city. I really really love their utensils btw. There were two kinds of tea that were served, barley tea and super smooth Japanese green tea. The tea cup was adorable!  The only thing that was lack a bit was the service, but what can I say, the staffs just always seem so busy.  I can't blame them. Otherwise, I would totally give them 5 star!!
Stephen J.}Manhattan, NY}76}232}3804}18}1}3/22/2014Updatedreview}So this is it, Hasaki - buhbye forever as I am flushing our 15-year relationship down your fancy toilets as your f**k-up of a maitre'd insisted on seating first those people who clearly arrived after us.  It is a true shame because our relationship was ruined by a person to whom the simple task of writing people's names down on a piece of paper and then reading them off in the order written was beyond her."There is nothing I can do," was the ridiculous and lamely mumbled answer when we called her out on what she did.  It was not even an honest mistake, she did not even think to apologize, and treated what she did as a matter of fact - hence this gormless excuse for a maitre'd deserves zero courtesy from us.The point is that if you are not going to take reservations, which is a policy that is perfectly fine, then you have to figure out a way to treat a little better those customers who have been coming to your tiny basement for 15 years.  Oh well, we're kind of sure we'll be able to find another sushi place in Manhattan...
Stephany A.}Lummus Park, Miami, FL}29}5}1}-1}1}2/22/2014}Really bad service and a disrespectful staff. Me and my friends walked-in and while waiting for a table I kindly asked the hosted to allow me to order something because I did not eat all day and was feeling sick. She told me I could not order while waiting for a table even though another waiter said they could. I agreed and asked if I could eat at the bar and they said yes.I sat at the bar by my self trying to order anything as I was feeling really sick and the cook very rudely told me "you cannot est here". When I asked for an explanation they said I was only allowed to sit at the table with my whole party. I explained I was not feeling well and had to eat something, that I would close the tap and order again at the table with my friends and the denied me service.My whole party had to leave after waiting for the table because I got sick and we had to find another place where I could eat anything faster.I still do not understand what was the problem with serving me a tea, a glass of watter or miso soup to keep their customers and stop me for fainting!?Rude staff, specially  the cook! I hope he is not the owner because this is not the way to run a business. Specially not the way to talk to pleople.
Eddie T.}Wanaque, NJ}126}97}634}-1}3}2/6/2014}Omakase ReviewFood:3.0Service:4.0Value:2.5Overall:3.25Nothing special here.  Omakase is like sushi deluxe here.  Everything is served all at once.  Dip the nigiri in regular soy sauce provided.  You pay $65  for Omakase and get $30 sushi deluxe.---------------------Omakase tips- Rice should be body temperature - so do not complain about rice being too hot- Fish should be room temperature - so do not complain if the chef used the torch to get the fish to room temperature.  Also this is why some places put their fish in a wood or metal box sans refrigeration - Eat with your hands or chopsticks.  Either method is fine.  But try to eat it in one bite, never putting any back on your plate.  I try to flip the nigiri so the fish side hits my tongue and taste buds first.  It makes a difference.- The nigiri should fall apart once it hits your mouth, that why the rice is sometimes loose.  *Reason to eat nigiri with your hands.- Eat each piece as soon as it is served.  Fresh from the chef's hand to your mouth!  That's why most Omakase places serve one piece at a time.- Soy sauce should be applied to the fish.  At most Omakase's now, the chefs brush it on.  If you are given soy sauce, do not dunk your rice into it.- Do not rub wooden chopsticks together.- Omakase's usually offer around ten nigiri and a hand roll, and can range in price from $45 to $100+.  Of course some places serve more and charge more.  ($500 for Masa)- If you're complaining that Omakase costs too much or doesn't fill you up, maybe it's not for you. Go to Key Food and pick up two trays of their sushi for $15.  And don't forget the soy sauce packets.
Henry L.}San Mateo, CA}2368}836}3037}18}3}2/5/2014}The sushi here is ok--nothing special. Portions are on the small side given the price, so don't go here if you're hungry! There's a wait, but the line is never too long. The decor inside is average, but at least the entrance is interesting.There are plenty of other sushi places in the area just a few steps away!
Legitimate G.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}2/4/2014}Do not come here. (Disclosure: this is probably my favorite restaurant for the last ten years.) While I might love it for its authenticity, high quality ingredients, overall subdued elegance and rock-solid consistency, I just don't think it's the kind of place that will satisfy your particular needs.For example, I am afraid you might not appreciate the service. I have always been satisfied with it, but then I like when servers are not overbearing, don't try to make small talk or ingratiate themselves. That is just me--I am peculiar like that.And the menu, even though every item on it might be thoughtfully conceived and skillfully executed, it is a rather spartan menu, free of anything trendy or bastardized, and you might find that boring.While they might offer your usual sushi bar-restaurant staples such as salmon teriyaki, they insist on doing so in their own way, with an emphasis on the quality of the fish, and perfect grilling technique. It's not for everyone. In fact the "teriyaki" sauce is served on the side and instead of being sweet and syrupy, it is thin and delicate.Listen, that every sushi chef here is real Japanese doesn't change the fact that this is basically just your straightforward sushi bar restaurant. It doesn't change the fact that they don't do a Dragon roll here. Hell, you can't even get so much as a basic Rainbow roll in this joint. And by the way, the nigiri sushi here is small--so small, you can eat a whole piece in one neat bite. You've been warned.And even if their tempura is the best I've had anywhere, in the world--what are you going to do with deep-fried gingko nuts, shiso leaves, and other such Japanese specialities? Not much, probably.Then there are these weird little details like the miso soup. Unlike at just about every other so-called Japanese joint around here, their miso is dark red, and it's based in a deep, smoky, full-flavored dashi broth, and garnished with some kind of Japanese clovery greens--to this day I don't even know what they are and I'm just afraid stuff like this will be troublesome for you.No, unless you happen to be the kind of fringe weirdo who appreciates authentic Japanese food that is skillfully prepared and delivered with a consistency so dependable it's almost boring, you should avoid this place.
Jane C.}Manhattan, NY}82}48}1857}-1}5}1/25/2014}I am always on the look out to try different sushi restaurants, but from when I first tried Hasaki more than 10 years ago, this is the place that I always come back to. I had tried better food elsewhere. But you will be hard pressed to find better quality for the prices that Hasaki is charging. What it comes down to is consistently great food, efficient service, reasonable prices. Every time we come here, we get reminded why we came back and always leave happy.The best part of the whole experience is their attention to the little details. Starting with the salad, they have an amazing ginger dressing that is the best I have ever tasted. The veggies are also top quality (you won't be finding iceberg lettuce in your salad here). The miso soup is also one of a kind. Here, they use red miso paste making it extra flavorful, and add in cilantro and small cubes of tofu, which are nice touches. Even their cup of hoji cha (green tea) is more flavorful than other places.I have tried most of the menu items, and would have to say that the $35 Kaisen don is my favorite. It's simply the best that you can get in the city for the price.  Each piece of sashimi is in the perfect mouthful size that melts in your mouth. To me, one important component of a good chirashi/kaisen don is the rice, and Hasaki has the best tasting rice. It comes down to them using quality rice and paying attention to to balance the flavors so that it flavor, but not too sour or salty. I also like their tamago sponge cake which is somewhat unique and is almost a mini dessert within the kaison don itself. To top it off, they give you fresh grated real wasabi.If you are hungry and want to eat cheap, come here for the $20 twilight special (must be ordered before 6:30 p.m.). Plenty of food, including a piece of grilled fish, tempura, sushi, and a variety of veggie side dishes, and everything is well executed.
Kitty W.}Forest Hills, NY}282}367}558}18}4}1/13/2014}Minus 1 star for service. Service is slow, even with a sufficient amount of staff. I had to flag down a waiter after waiting for several minutes with the menu closed, hoping someone would come take down my order. Sufficient amount of people with insufficient amount of training. Food wise, this place is excellent for it's price point. For the price ,the quality for the food is amazing. We ordered the omakase sushi for one to try for $45, and it came with 8 pieces of sushi, 2 egg (what do you all the egg sushi!), and a toro roll. The toro, uni, and scallop were by far my three favorite pieces. We also ordered a cooked salmon w sea salt & lemon, simple but cooked to perfection. The nabeyaki udon was good,but not memorable, but this place still kicks ass for it's fresh fish.No, i don't like their overly salty miso soup people seem to love here though.
Seth T.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}47}65}4}-1}4}1/12/2014}I came here for lunch yesterday after hearing from a family member that they have a great lunch plate special with a variety of food for just $18.  They were right!  The dish came with:Shrimp & Vegetable Tempura - 6 piecesGrilled Salmon2 small veggie slaws4 pieces of sushi + 1 tuna rollSoup + SaladFruit and tea for dessertDefinitely a great deal for a lot of food.  The portions of each thing were pretty small, but I left the restaurant decently full and satisfied.  The sushi quality isn't amazing here, but it is pretty average and a great deal with the other food that comes with this lunch plate.  The grilled salmon was a bit dry, but flavorful with whatever miso-flavored marinate was on it.  I also liked the salad dressing, as it was a little lighter than typical Japanese restaurant dressings.  The fruit for dessert was very fresh, which left a great end to the meal. I'll be back next time I want a variety of food for lunch without breaking the bank.
Mike T.}New York, NY}206}88}22}-1}5}1/9/2014}The sansho-yaki at Hasaki may very well be the best Japanese chicken dish you'll ever have. Excellent sushi as well. However, don't expect Americanized or fusion-like rolls: I jokingly asked the waiter if they made Philadelphia rolls, and he gave me a look as if I slapped his baby.
Brad P.}New York, NY}127}237}35}-1}4}1/4/2014}Had the omakase. Fairly cheap relative to other places that offer it. Quality was on par with the price you pay, but not over the top. Service was good, and it's just an overall good japanese sushi restuarnat.
DineGirl K.}Manhattan, NY}42}104}0}-1}4}12/20/2013}Much better than you would expect given the casual atmosphere and affordable price points. They have some of the best tempura in the city - crispy and light, which you can select a la carte. There's always a mix of seasonal specials. All Japanese staff with an authentic menu. Noodles are great in the winter time.  Go early to avoid the wait. Great casual spot for top notch casual Japanese. Something for everyone on the menu.
Noa L.}New York, NY}6}61}12}-1}4}12/8/2013}After a while of looking for the best sushi restaurant in my area, I am glad to say I finally found it. Hasaki is a pretty authentic little japanese place that has the BEST quality fish. Everything is always delicious, the lunch specials are reasonably priced and great service. Love this place.
Michelle T.}New York, NY}319}971}1072}18}5}12/7/2013}We arrived around 12:30pm and was seated immediately. Our waitress brought over some menus - both the regular and the lunch special - and hot towels for us to clean our hands with. This is particularly helpful since it was pretty chilly that day. After some studying of the menus, we were ready to order.I went with the Lunch Plate ($18.00), which comes with: Shrimp & Vegetable TempuraGrilled Fish of the DayTwo small dishesYour choice of sushi or sashimiSoup + SaladFruit for dessertIt sounds like a lot and it definitely was! The soup and salad came first followed by all the cooked foods on a tray. The sushi was plated on a separate plate. The tempura was very good - everything was lightly battered and fried. It did not feel heavy or oily at all. The sushi was also very fresh and filling. I liked that I could get a whole meal - starters, entree and a tiny dessert to end the meal - all for just $18.00.We were given hot green tea during our meal and then hot hojicha to help digestion after our dishes were all cleared away. I love their attention to details and the small things! Our waitress was very attentive the entire meal, refilling our tea and checking up on us. I can definitely see myself coming more often - for lunch and for dinner.
Bobbie J.}New York, NY}11}144}21}-1}4}12/5/2013}Shrimp tempura is My Favorite Food in the Whole World, and Hasaki is my little piece of heaven.  I usually order a la carte and get a salad, sushi, some sake, of course, and a little bit of MFFITWW.  My partner always gets the omakase and leaves it up to the chef, and it's always fresh and delicious.I can be a grump sometimes about noise, and sometimes I just want a quiet restaurant.  I work hard!  I'll take a chill, intimate place over Buddakan any day.  Here, the dining room is so calm and mellow, it makes it a pleasant place to be.   The restaurant is located down a flight of stairs from the street, so it is super discreet, which I also like.I do wish they took reservations, but this grump likes to eat early anyway, so it usually works out.
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}3}10/21/2013}Below street-level shop so it can be hidden. Slower service but a solid meal if you just want standard fare from sashimi to chawan mushi to grilled black cod. Perhaps not the most focused menu. While nothing is sing about, go out of your way for, must eat if in city, everything is decent.
Andrew D.}Brooklyn, NY}780}582}227}18}5}10/13/2013Updatedreview}I keep coming back to Hasaki and everything is always excellent.It is one of my favorite Japanese lunches and the service is top notch.I had the sushi adajo, which was extremely fresh and delicious.The red miso soup which comes with it is superb with it's smoky flavor; the definition of umami.My favorite of all the fish in the sushi was the eel with the wonderful savory and sweet contrast.Follow it up with a pastry two doors down at Panya.
Sora M.}Portland, OR}10}55}72}-1}1}10/12/2013}I am NOT going back to this place. Period. The service was bad an the foods were very questionable. Wasting time and money.

Lucy M.}Brooklyn, NY}70}215}30}18}3}8/21/2013}I would have given Hasaki 4 stars except their service is terrible.  I've been there a few times in the last month because their sushi is fresh and delicious.  However, their waitstaff really needs to be better trained.  I went on a Tuesday night and  the restaurant was busy, but not overwhelming.  However, it still took the waiter about 15 minutes before he even acknowledged us sitting at our table and that was only after we started flagging them down.  Inattentiveness and bad service seems to be thru out the establishment.  The guy going around the restaurant filling water glasses stopped by our table a few times.  However, he seemed to only be able to fill up one glass and all at the table despite them all obviously needing a refill.  Service was also very slow and no one seemed to pay you any attention unless you flag them down.  Great food but bad service never bodes well for a restaurant since there are so many good restaurants of similar quality in that area.
Diane C.}Hoboken, NJ}247}530}7}-1}3}8/20/2013}Great miso soup, high quality fish at Hasaki but the overall experience is a big disappointment due to the large amount of fruit flies that were ever present during dinner.  We sat at the table right in front of the window and maybe that contributed to the fly debacle, but pests at a dinner is never pleasant, especially when that meal isn't cheap!
Jonathan C.}New York, NY}183}123}7}-1}4}8/14/2013}Preface/background: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value). Less meat, no more 2 Chipotle burrito eating.I've been to many a Japanese restaurant, and it's on par with the good restaurants I've come across. I came in during lunch time at 3pm, ordered a Chirashi Soba Set for $18 - comes with soba noodles, chirashi (assorted pieces of raw fish over sushi rice), and a small set of 2 carrots, yellow pickled radish, and 2 pieces of lenkon (lotus root). I also ordered 2 pieces of nigiri:-scallop for $4-aji horse mackarel for $5The fish was fresh, the noodles were tasty, the nigiri was tasty, and I was full by the end. All in all, I'll come back when I'm in the neighborhood. The total after tip ran me $35 - a little pricey for a lunch meal, but the quality of the food was pretty solid.Take away - if you like fresh fish, you're in the area, you have some time to eat (service was a little slow, even at 3pm), stop by this spot.
Parisa S.}New York, NY}253}539}7}-1}3}7/16/2013}Good menu, reasonable prices, seems pretty legit.  The sushi melts in your mouth, particularly the salmon.  I wish the seaweed salad were a bit more traditional, but this was more than made up for by the fab shrimp shumai.  But of course, fresh fish is what you come to Hasaki for, and fresh fish is what you get.  Quality rolls and excellent pieces with just the right fish:rice ratio.Only 3 stars because while I was definitely impressed during my visit, I had a terrible stomach ache for the rest of the night.
Jackie P.}New York, NY}13}114}145}-1}3}7/8/2013}This place can get realy crowded on a Friday night and I'm not surprised given the location and the quality of fish.  I ordered the omakase and my friend ordered the chirashi special for the evening.  I was very surprised with the plating it was not what I expected.  It was beautifully presented on a big Japanese ceramic plate and my friend's chirashi was served in a wooden 2-compartment box with the ikura rice on one side and the sashimi on the other.  Besides the long wait for the food, everything was pleasant and I would go back there again but maybe on a less crowded evening?
Pornpimol N.}Manhattan, NY}6}15}16}-1}5}6/16/2013}The food here is very good. Fish is fresh. The service is good and price is reasonable. It's my first time here and I'm impress it. Definitly will be my favorite sushi spot in NYC!
May Y.}Hong Kong}1507}198}272}-1}3}6/1/2013}A happy accident. My friend and I were so exhausted that we just went to the first Japanese restaurant we saw on the street, but we are delighted by the food at Hasaki. The red miso soup is authentic and favorable, comparable to the one in Yakitori Totto. The tempura layer on shitake mushrooms and eggplants was the thinnest and crispest that I have ever had. I would definitely go back to Hasaki for the tempura. However, I wish the waitress provided us water when we first sat down rather than giving it to us after twenty minutes. Great food but service has room for improvement.
Marlene E.}New York, NY}58}53}8}-1}5}5/21/2013}My favorite place to eat fresh sashimi.  Casual, friendly, pricy but worth it.  Mori the moody sushi chef and all the wonderful staff.  I have never been dissappointed, consistently fresh and a great place to dine with friends or alone.
Jenny S.}San Francisco, CA}486}233}3}-1}5}5/13/2013}Came up on this place on accident. Was in the area and hungry and everything else seemed packed. Was able to get in and get a seat at the bar quickly. This is by far my fave sushi place in NYC thus far and here is why:- Affordable sushi- The sashimi is amazing- The rolls are also just as awesome- The mixed drinks are tasty- The beer and saki are original and delish- The ambiance is cultured, but nice and not too stuffyThere really are no cons to this place whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and go here!!!
Emily R.}Manhattan, NY}447}353}3}-1}4}5/10/2013}Came to Hasaki at the strong recommendation of a friend, who is also somewhat of a sushi aficionado. I've actually walked by here many times and always seen it packed, so I was psyched when my friend and I were able to get 2 seats at the bar to share some sushi.The shrimp shumai was unique - a lot softer, a lot less dumpling style than what I've had at other places around the city. I'm into it.  Then, we split  spicy tuna & yellowtail scallion rolls (spicy tuna was super creamy), 3 pieces of toro (ballin'), salmon, eel, and more yellowtail.  It was all super light and fresh, came out quickly...thumbs up!Will come back to try the udon.
Chelsey C.}Brooklyn, NY}11}30}5}-1}5}4/29/2013}Stopped in here on a whim to catch a quick bite and Im glad I did...Miso soup is unlike any I've ever had, thicker, with an almost smoky flavor but it worked.  I got salmon avocado rolls and everything was unbeleivably fresh, most neatly rolled sushi I think I've ever seen.  Great presentation, all clean lines.  Also ordered the miso black cod (which tastes almost exactly like Nobu's for decidedly less) and then after inhaling that ordered another.  The salmon with basil sauce, which I was skeptical about when my godmother ordered it for the table was also delicious.  Waitress was a little flaky (I had to ask for lemons for the water three times and she forgot my boyfriends order of suchi entirely) but not bad enough when weighed against the food to take a star off.  Also be warned, portions are kind of stingy so you might be tempted to order seconds (and thirds...) which will run your bill up.  But the food is amazing.  Worth it.
Tina Y.}WALL STREET, NY}229}268}2984}-1}4}4/19/2013}I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place in the East Village, shortly after it's 5:30pm dinner opening time.  Passed by this basement location and saw lots of people happily dining at such an early hour, and their food looked delicious!  We were on our way to pick up a bottle of sake from Sakaya, but ended up back here after for an early dinner.After reviewing the menu, we realized that many people were there for the Twilight Special for $20 which was only available until 6:30pm.  Since we don't usually eat that early, we decided what the heck, lets give it a try since we were there.  We ordered the special as well as Tsukemono (Pickles) and Uni.  The special started off with a salad, then a miso soup.  The miso was the most delicious miso soup I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant.  It was piping hot when it came out.  This is the only place I know if that uses red miso to make soup, red miso is suppose to be healthier for you anyways if you believe it, but regardless it is much stronger than white miso. The food took forever to come, which annoyed us a bit considering the fact that we ordered first and this other couple got their food at the same time as us.  So lesson learned is the twilight special is done in batches in the kitchen, therefore it took a while.  The pickles were good.  The pickle dish included two pieces of carrot, three slices of lotus root, three cucumber slices along with a handful of red pickles.The uni was quite disappointing.  I wouldn't order it again from here.  The main course was pretty good.  The hijiki salad was my favorite, and I loved the tempura.  The eggplants were well flavored.  I didn't think the salmon or okra was that special.The sushi dish was decently fresh.  It came out immediately after our other plates were taken away.  Just normal tuna, salmon and some sort of mackerel.Overall, I had a pleasant experience although the wait for my main course was too long and unacceptable.
Publius K.}Philadelphia, PA}8}104}2}-1}4}4/6/2013}Although there are a number of Japanese restaurants nearby, the only one besides Village Yokocho (and that is a different sort altogether) that has been consistently excellent is Hasaki. Have been coming to Hasaki for almost a decade, and it has never disappointed.Good service, great sushi and sashimi, good tempura and a really lovely oshinko plate.
Susan L.}Brooklyn, NY}8}59}31}-1}3}3/29/2013}I honestly don't understand how this place gets a 4 star rating from the yelp community. I've been here twice and the second time was better than the first but still, definitely not a 4 star experience. I left with a very bad stomach ache (I'll spare the details) after the first time but I went back for a second time today thinking that it could just have been a fluke the first time. So far no stomach ache so that's always a plus. The fish was decently fresh, nothing to write home about, but the problem I had was the rice. It was overly seasoned and overpowered the delicate flavors of the fish. Perhaps it was the extremely salty red miso soup I had prior to my sushi that led to my taste buds going haywire but I really wished the rice wasn't quite so salted and vinegared (that's not even a word but I'll settle).I chose the $35 sushi omakase option and  was pleased to find that I wasn't getting the typical types of fish and they did take my request for uni into consideration. There was mackerel, scallop, sea eel, uni, black snapper, smoked ocean trout, toro, one more piece I can't quite remember, and a tuna (possibly toro, couldn't here the explanation from the waiter) roll. This also comes with a choice of either soup or salad (wish I had opted for the salad. I would have said this meal was definitely worth the money if the rice didn't ruin it. Hope that problem will be fixed and I will be back more often.
Eri B.}McLean, VA}23}27}66}-1}3}3/26/2013}This place was dece as far as casual sushi places go.  It's a down-to-earth sushi bar in a cool neighborhood. That's it. It's clean, it's quick, but it's nothing spectacular. I started with the seaweed salad, which was delicious -- I loved the dressing.  For my dinner, I ordered the Salmon Oyako Donburi (grilled salmon and salmon roe over sushi rice).  I have had many salmon oyako donburis in the past and consider myself *a bit* of a connoisseur ;).  It was pretty good, nothing gross or horribly wrong with it. But where was the ikura?! There were six, nice slices of barely grilled salmon on the (very well flavored) sushi rice; however, there was only a tiny spoonful of ikura!   Overall, it was a nice meal, but would I make a special trip to go back? Probably not.
Emily C.}Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI}0}4}4}-1}5}3/22/2013}My sister has been telling me  one of her favorite Japanese restaurants, Hasaki for years. I always want to try, but I did not have any chance to visit Hasaki until tonight. I Love their Kitchen Special Menu!!!   EXCELLENCE JAPANESE FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
Samuel H.}New Brunswick, NJ}0}2}0}-1}5}3/9/2013}I had a grilled salmon, and it was simply amazing!The ambiance is beautiful, and you won't find a cleaner place than this in the village! (trust me, there are some very unsanitary places out there)Cheers all!
Nomad M.}New York, NY}123}276}1023}-1}4}2/18/2013}I came here after discovered village yokocho did not open for lunch:/ as I have been wanting to check hasaki out anyway. And I am glad I did!I came in late for lunch, 2:30ish, by myself. So I was seated immediately no issue. The decor is typical Japanese style -  mainly wood in original color and bamboo .A cute japanese waitress promptly handed me a hot towel and menu. I ordered right off the menu - seaweed salad, sashimi lunch plate and uni sashimi! Seaweed came first in tri-color. Good but not blowing head good. Then came my sashimi - a heaven of frutti del mare! Uni was fresh and creamy, but somehow lacking the flavor was not as strong as I was used to. Maybe it is east coast uni (Maine, most likely).The sashimi plat consists of flute, yellow tail, octopus, salmon and spanish mackerel. Presentation was beautiful and taste was fresh. Just good quality of fish, though I think the cut is a bit too thick :/ The star here, actually, was the wasabi! A good japanese restaurant should have good wasabi even though they don't have to make it in house. Because they know, bad wasabi can ruin the taste however good quality the fish it was applied on! The wasabi here was fresh and just right amount of pungentness that brings out the sweetness of the fish itself. I could not help but asking what brand they were using  :) and they kindly write it down for me.It is quiet and quaint which makes Hakaki standing out from a dozens of JP restaurants in E.V. It would be a nice place to take a date. I will def come back for the omakase some other time!
HK E.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}47}28}-1}2}1/31/2013}it was very good few years agoit was good two years agoit was ok last yearit is so so nowquality of the fish keeps going downfor example, the fishes on KAISEN DON is very different now* every time i go, i spend over $100 per person and i am expecting something better...
Anita C.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}21}8}6}-1}5}1/26/2013}If you like to try something new & different Japanese food, it is best place to go! I strongly recommend " Grilled Banana with ice cream" for desert, even my boyfriend loves it!
Amanda A.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}0}9}0}-1}4}1/14/2013}Super authentic and great service!  I've been eating sushi since I was 4 years old so I know good, fresh, authentic sushi when I come by it.   I went here off a recommendation from Refinery 29 and they hit the nail on the head with this one!  The food came super fast and their staff was attentive but gave you your space.  The fish was fresh and the rice was delicious.  Also, their miso soup was probably the best miso I've ever had in my life, so flavorful and rich!  I will definitely be going there again.
Leslie V.}Sunnyside, NY}8}33}6}-1}5}1/11/2013}The husband and I came here to celebrate  our first anniversary. We knew coming in that we were going to order the Omakase. We were pleasantly surprised that they offered a variety of choices. We don't recall that from the last time we ate here. We decided to go for the Sushi and Sashimi for two ($120). It was 16 pieces (8 each) of Sashimi and 16 pieces of Sushi. Everything was delicious. I took a picture of the sashimi plate but forgot to take one of the sushi. I was so excited to eat all the yummy sushi (especially the uni). We were full and extremely satisfied but not stuffed - that's how it should be. We can't wait to go back again.
James O.}Forest Hills, NY}210}108}1}-1}3}1/3/2013}The Good: The food is very good. The sushi is really fresh, well made and of supreme quality. For the price and the quality of food, it is actually very reasonable if you compare it to like Blue Ribbon. The Sushi/Sashimi Dinner for 2 at $52 is actually reasonable considering the portion and quality. The California Roll is made with real crabmeat sticks and not Pollock. Did not order any of the hot food or noodles and only sushi. Why only 3 stars: Service was a big minus. Both the server for my table and the hostess were extremely unfriendly. And they were unfriendly to everyone, so it was not just my problem. I did not see the server crack a smile to anyone. Maybe it was late, maybe it was rainy, but she was not in a good mood and neither was the hostess.Overall: Would I come back again? Probably not by my own volition. But if someone wants to go there, I won't complain.
Steve L.}Tucson, AZ}234}222}251}-1}4}12/12/2012}Meant to go to the Japanese tea house just east of here but couldn't wait out the line so we came here, a blessing in disguise. It was a co-worker's birthday and the bento boxes were great. Authentic tea, sushi and soup too for a decent price -- I know because the birthday girl is a self-admitting sushi snob.
Buo Z.}New York, NY}490}921}703}-1}3}12/3/2012}I came here for a quick dinner. The monkfish nabe special was very bland or maybe that is how most nabes are. The Edo-mae style sushi (comes seared or with sauce on top) was good but the fish quality was so-so. Several pieces of fish had sinew and were generally hard to chew through. The green tea ice cream was the fake kind and I definitely judge Japanese places by the green tea ice cream to confirm the quality of the food. The dark green, slightly bitter green tea ice cream is the best and can only be found at some Japanese restaurants (not sold in grocery stores or supermarkets anywhere). On the other hand, the sesame ice cream was quite good. This place is definitely not the best deal in the neighborhood for sushi.
Anna B.}Manhattan, NY}2}15}0}-1}4}11/9/2012}Food: 4.5 StarsDecor: 3 StarsGood looking people: 3 StarsThis is the place for authentic sushi lovers. This isn't your fancy shmancy place.

Justin B.}West Hollywood, CA}78}65}0}-1}5}11/3/2012}i die for this sushi place. and it's such a bummer that i haven't reviewed it yet, since i've been going here for years. the first time i came here was maybe about seven years ago with this guy that i was dating at the time. it was our first weekend together here in the city since he lived here, and i was just visiting him. he was the type of guy who wanted to take me somewhere that i would be really impressed with, that it would make him seem like he totally knew the hot places to go to in the city. well, when you look at this place from the outside, you don't quite get that it is a hot place to go...or any place to go to, really. but when you eat here, you know. after not having been back here for several years, i paid the place a visit with a friend the other month. we sat at the bar since there wasn't any seating at a table. i was surprised on a saturday night to get instant seating, when in the past i was used to waiting up to an hour. i think partially that's because the place has lost it's trend appeal, but sucks for the other guys. i'm happy to sit down a bit faster to enjoy my meal.the fish here is always so fresh, and the quality is spot on. the plating is simple and traditional. the menu reads the same way. all in all, the experience feels natural and not forced, which is why it is my favorite sushi place here in the city. i don't come to a sushi restaurant for a show, i come for good sushi. i've had the omakase for two here several times. i was never disappointed. the variety of fish makes it worth the price, and you leave satisfied every time. the presentation is special in how everything is laid out in front of you, again very simple, but smart. there's a classic sophistication here that feels so authentic. this time around, i just had a few rolls and a salad. everything was just as delicious as i had remembered it, but the simplicity of it had such an unforced casual feeling. something i was so pleased to experience, which makes me want to agree with other reviews saying that this is the type of place that should become a regular destination in anyone's dining diary. thank you for not losing your appeal time and time again over the years.
J D.}Brooklyn, NY}6}6}0}-1}5}10/12/2012}This place is just what I need once a week, to read while chomping on a perfectly executed hijiki salad and one of the most equilibrated and tasty kaisedon bowls in the city. Quiet and hidden, it's great to drop by and eat dinner at the bar or talk with a friend on one of their tables.Sometimes it gets packed, depending on the time, but it's ok.One of my favorite sushi places in the city.
Boki H.}Manhattan, NY}14}177}218}-1}4}10/7/2012}The grilled black cod is heavenly!!! That was one of the tenderest fish I've had! And only $16 for the set?! What else can you expect! Will def come back again!
Matthew C.}Hoboken, NJ}153}147}123}-1}4}10/6/2012}My girlfriend and I purchased a Groupon deal for this place and were very happy we got it. I would have never known about this place if it was not for the Groupon deal. We arrived right when it opened for dinner which was great because the woman gave us great service. As the dinner rush came in we were neglected a bit but not to bad. My only complaint was where we sat. We were tucked away by this small stage with a drum set on it. Not to pleasing to the eye. The menu was diverse a which made it difficult to choose but in a good way. The sushi was delicious. We even got two more rolls even though we thought we were ready to leave. If you love sushi try this place.
Vanna V.}Concourse, Bronx, NY}0}29}2}-1}5}10/4/2012}LOVE IT! Everything tasted great! Had the tuna roll and the spicy pork belly... Everything was so flavorful! And the service was THE BEST service I've seen EVER! I  also had the grilled banana with the black sesame ice cream.. to die for! Definitely coming back!
N H.}New York, NY}5}42}14}-1}3}10/1/2012Updatedreview}I went to Hasaki for lunch. In the past I have ordered their chirashi -which was better than average- so I decided to try some more unusual fish from the a la carte sashimi menu and see how it compared to other places in the neighborhood with more sophisticated and higher-end offerings for sushi aficionados. If you're a sashimi or sushi enthusiast (I don't mean that lightly), I would avoid Hasaki and go elsewhere because I feel there would be some disappointment dining here, especially since the a la carte and omakase prices are in the same range of superior sushi restaurants. I felt that my meal was very lacking in quality for the price. I'm sorry to report that my sashimi meal was not great, but it' wasn't entirely bad either. The piece of Anago (sea eel) was on the cusp of turning rancid, it was not fresh enough to serve. The Californian uni was a bit past it's prime with an unpleasant metallic tang to the flavor.  While I had better luck with the other pieces of sashimi in terms of freshness, the quality was not very high. The scallop was fairly bland and mealy in texture, and the Unagi, Ikura, Aji, and Saba were better than average and yet unfortunately the best items on my plate. There wasn't a single piece of sashimi that evoked a joyful response from my tastebuds, and I found myself using much more soy sauce than usual. On the bright side, it was sufficient and still superior to the sushi served by some of the lower priced Japanese restaurants. But again, Hasaki's a la carte prices are in the same tier as higher end places in the neighborhood with whom Hasaki cannot compete with on quality. For the sushi novice or those who stick to sushi sets rather than ordering unusual fishes by the piece (a la carte), Hasaki is still better than average for sushi, but it doesn't compare to Yuba and Kanoyama.However, if you're the type who is happy with an average sushi set with the usual trilogy of tuna/salmon/fluke and notice freshness rather than than detecting the subtle nuances of fish quality, you might find this place to be very good.
Gab G.}New York, NY}185}1326}3675}18}5}9/29/2012}Hot damn. Now this is sushi.
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}4}9/9/2012}Excellent sushi. Super fresh.  The uni was particularly smooth and flavorful.  The spicy tuna roll was excellent as well.  My boyfriend ordered the chirashi and was impressed by how fresh everything tasted.  I'll pass on the gobo roll next time, it was very tough and bitter.  Not edible.  I'm not sure whether this is a pro or con, but the rice, is also a little bit different at Hasaki.  It tastes like something half way between white and brown rice and I found it to be a little bitter.  I guess I would prefer the more standard white rice if I had a choice, but the fresh sushi certainly makes me want to come back.  I also thought all the prices were very reasonable. The sushi also came with a nice side salad with ginger dressing which was excellent.Service was excellent.  We stayed till closing and I was pleasantly surprised by how thoroughly they cleaned the sushi bar and cases with soapy warm water at the end of the night.
Anna L.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}85}52}37}-1}4}9/4/2012}Hidden little gem near St Mark's.  We went for the Twilight special (from 5:30 to 6:30) and it is touted as a sampler platter.  We started with salad, red miso soup (very full bodied, almost too salty), and the warm part of the entree.  The entree dishes included tempura (shrimp, crab ball, broccoli and carrot), sweet potato hash, crispy seaweed salad, grilled salmon and an eggplant sautee.  Then the rice and sashimi came out.  All this for $20!  Everything is very tasty and though small it all added up to us being very full.  My favorite was the sashimi, which was fresh and almost melts in your mouth good.  My date really liked the hash and the tempura crab ball.  Just when we started to get full, out came our chawanmushi!  It was silken and tasty and smooth and filled with seafood and mushrooms.I would've given a 5 but the waitress was obviously not happy about being there, though the other staff (particularly the hostess) were happily working away.
Lydia C.}Brooklyn, NY}46}148}238}-1}4}7/26/2012}A friend had recommended this restaurant and I have always missed it! I came for Sunday brunch and ordered the Afternoon Tea box. It came with soup, salad, your choice of sushi/sashimi (7 pieces - tuna, salmon, and yellowtail), 2 sides, tempura, and grilled fish of the day. After the meal, our dessert was an assortment of fresh fruits and tea to cleanse the stomach. The fish was fresh and the meal itself was satisfying. Not to mention the set meal was less than $20. Definitely a great option for Sat/Sun brunch if you're craving for traditional Japanese.
Che W.}New York, NY}38}186}6}-1}5}7/24/2012}I've been to many a sushi place in Manhattan, especially after living in the East Village for a couple years.  I think this is now my favorite.As others have mentioned, the $20-or-so twilight special (if you can get there before 6:30pm) is an amazing deal.  I couldn't believe you get 4 large pieces of various tempura.  The fresh fruit for dessert was also unbelievably fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I left stuffed.  Next time, I think we'll get one twilight special and the miso cod...that should be enough to share!
darcey h.}New York, NY}324}183}128}-1}5}7/16/2012}I would call myself a sushi enthusiast & frequent lover of this genre of cuisine but I can't say I am an expert so take my 5th star from this perspective. You can probably expect a considerable wait but I'm not sure how I feel about sushi that I didn't have to wait for.My sushi criteria is based on the following & Hasaki crazy delivered on all of these:- a cross section of Japanese & Caucasians that take sushi seriously- sushi chefs that look really serious about their craft- size of nigiri; bigger isn't better. Better is better. - at least one table of visiting Japanese businessmen & women that are spending the equivalent of a 3rd world country's GND on sushi. If this is where they come to impress each other with their sushi prowess then I want to eat there. - lots of people eating off-the-menu items that are completely unidentifiable You won't find "half price" sushi offers here or rolls the size of your head. But you find sublime pieces of fish that you could forget to use soy or wasabi with.
Dina B.}New York, NY}0}130}0}-1}2}6/5/2012}Sushi is on the small side...and if you factor in the price, then Hasaki is not cheap.I thought the sushi didnt seem fresh. I was a bit disappointed with the sushi platter, so I ordered the blue fin tuna a la carte.  Big mistake.  I suspect they were trying to pull the wool over our eyes by  serving the regular tuna.Good table service.
Gail Anthony T.}Jersey City, NJ}77}155}25}-1}4}5/14/2012}I took my wife here for Mother's Day last night.  We sat at the sushi bar, in front of Mori-san, the head sushi chef and owner.  We ordered the 'Omakase for Two' and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  One of the best sushi/sashimi dining experiences since Sushi Ota in San Diego.  Mind you, I've been to Ushiwakamaru and Sushi Yasuda, and it was very comparable.Some of the highlights were the smoked octupus, chu toro (of course), uni and ikura sushi, sea cucumber, and sea pineapple (1st time trying these).  I had to Google what a sea pineapple was and it's basically an edible ascidian or sea squirt.  Whatever.  It was delicious.We also ordered the vegetable tempura - which was perfectly battered.  The taste of the veggies wasn't masked by the excessive batter like other places use.  It didn't even need tempura sauce; just a lemon squeeze and a quick dip in some course sea salt.All this was washed down by some Yebisu beer, and a sake that Mori-san recommended.  Speaking of recommendations, go to Hasaki....now!
Nick L.}San Mateo, CA}82}1025}13}-1}4}5/11/2012}Not bad at all.We actually popped in here whilst waiting for Ippudo to free up! We were hungry!!I had the sushi and sashimi combination and that was 4 star worthy. Not the best I've had but better than some.Cold noodles were also ordered which I always find odd but having sampled a bit was surprised. It was good as well. A bit on the pricey side.
David F.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}15}-1}2}5/11/2012}Something is going on with Hasaki and it's not good. Not horrible, but curious.  Always has been a busy place where we would wait for a table.  Last visit, empty at 8pm?  What?  Sushi had rock hard avocado in it! ? WHAT?  Everything else was fine but clearly the sushi's getting smaller and less spectacular.  Someone leave who was in charge before.  I'd rate it higher, but I just wanted to get some attention.  Clearly something is amiss.
KL Z.}Manhattan, NY}2}107}42}-1}3}4/30/2012}Meh. Recommended by a coworker and headed here with a friend. Although fresh the fish was nothing spectacular. I had a better taste bud awakening at less expensive places, and they're all within walking distance from this restaurant. Not bad but not worthy of my return nor my money.
M. R.}New York, NY}34}58}32}-1}5}4/22/2012}This place is small but best authentic Japanese meal sets and sushi.  I like it here and usually hit this place for Sunday brunch.  The price is cheap, in my opinion.  It's close to my other favorite hangouts.
tiffanie n.}Brooklyn, NY}111}569}7}-1}4}4/7/2012}New fav. sushi spot! I got the Spicy Tuna Roll and Yellowtail w/Scallion. Fresh and delicious. I really like the rice in the sushi...is that weird? Also got this shrimp dumpling thing that was pretty good. I can't wait to go back here to try more stuff!

Isabel L.}New York, NY}257}406}91}-1}4}3/29/2012Updatedreview}Wanted to also mention they have really good lunch specials too !for about 18-20 dollars, you get a salad, your choice of rice bowl( Eeel Don, Salmon Don, Chirashi) with a side of hot or cold soba.I really enjoy their generous portions and variety! satisfies the greedy me that can never decide what she wants.Highly recommended in the East Village area :)
Emi M.}Miami, FL}116}38}2}-1}4}3/21/2012}Excellent spicy tuna roll. The fish is very good quality which explains the pricing.
Jan Y.}Long Island City, NY}97}374}1307}-1}3}2/15/2012}Mediocre food, nothing special.  Prices are reasonable.  I will unlikely be back.
tanichea b.}New York, NY}5}77}34}-1}5}2/3/2012}Definitely some of the best sushi and sashimi that I've had. You can taste the quality and freshness! The salmon is unbelievable. The cooked dishes are worth trying as well, especially if you have a guest that's not into sushi. The grilled black cod is delicious as well as the garlic beef. The Steak Japanese is tender and moist and tastes wonderful. Finish the meal off with a nice bottle of Sake and everyone is happy. I'd say everything is fairly priced for the quality of food you get. I will definitely come back.
Jia Z.}Cherry Hill, NJ}31}52}28}-1}3}2/1/2012}Pretty good but could be better? Soup way too salty, but the sashimi is pretty fresh.  Their fish overall is good, I just did not have enough time to try more dishes.  I can't say it's the BEST I've ever had or maybe my taste buds expected more.  Great presentation though. One thing I did not like was how slow the food came out .. too slow for NYC.
Avanti M.}New York, NY}1}13}0}-1}5}12/27/2011}We had the twilight special. They gave us plentiful of tempura (2 shrimp, eggplant, carrot), hijiki nimono, rock shrimp, sweet potato nimono, 6 pieces of sashimi (tuna, snapper, salmon), akadashi miso soup (rarity outside Japan...complete with sansho pepper), salad, rice, and dessert.  The quantity alone is impressive, but their tempura was probably the best I had outside Japan.  Neither soggy, nor floury-powdery, crispy on the outside, sealing the flavor and moisture of the ingredients inside.  Their seasoning all across the board is subtle yet flavorful: essence of Japanese cuisine.  I also cannot say enough about akadashi miso soup.  The red miso, combined with the bonito broth, creates a perfect harmony of a soup, and sansho brings out the depth of the flavor even more.Their service is pure clockwork; our green tea cups kept refilled without our noticing. Hats off to this old-timer Japanese.
Astrid L.}New York, NY}2}33}0}-1}2}12/16/2011}This used to be my favorite sushi place in the city until I started to have bad experience in there, mostly rude staff, it always seem to be the same people and the same problems every time I come back, if only they could be as friendly and professional as Sobaya this place would be amazing...
Juan J.}Brooklyn, NY}106}705}187}18}3}12/1/2011}I like the intimate ambiance, however food was nothing out of ordinary.  We had the afternoon plate, and it was a lot of food (extra points for the portion).  I like what I had, however not 4 star worthy...  BTW, I didn't have any sushi (can't comment on their rice), but the sashimi were fresh.
Fredda C.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}2}11/29/2011}This place used to be one of the best in the St. Mark's locale, best food and most gracious service - but it isn't what it used to be. The pieces of fish are much smaller, and the prices are higher. I agree with the previous poster that the rice is too sour - and in a sushi place, the rice is everything. The servers will reach right across your face to pick something up. The check you are presented with will say "Pre-Tip Amount" and show the after-tax total. I tip on the food and beverage total, double the tax+ which results in a 18-20% tip. Please don't 'suggest' to me that I must tip on the tax I'm being charged as well. Of course, if the service is above average, I will always tip more. The hostess should not poke you if she wants you to move your stuff - a simple 'excuse me' would suffice.
MT P.}New York, NY}2}34}2}-1}2}11/26/2011}Below average sushi and non-sushi dishes and overpriced. Everything but the tea was a huge disappointment.  The sushi wasn't fresh, the age tofu and tempura were terrible -- we couldn't finish it.  The miso soup is strangely too spiced that you can't really eat it.  Everything was just off -- the sushi rice was a tad too sour, the eel roll and salmon skin roll were too salty and strangely off (not spoiled, just didn't taste right). The sushi wasn't that fresh.  Definitely not going back.  I can't understand how this place could have gotten these great reviews. Must be from people who haven't really had good sushi to judge.  Plus it was overpriced!  Two stars -- one for the atmosphere (nice room) and the second because it wasn't awful. Go somewhere else!
Maximillian M.}San Francisco, CA}186}2204}1}-1}4}11/14/2011}The sashimi was sublime... such great quality. Also had the monkfish appetizer (no, not the liver), delicious. Jeez, even the salad dressing was great. I almost wish I had to drop a deuce just to try out the robotoilet.
Vivian W.}New York, NY}3}2}0}-1}1}11/7/2011}Will never go back again.A friend told me they have good sushi so I went on my birthday. We ordered Omakase sashimi for two ($120) big mistake. First of all, everything was brought out at the same time in a plate and let's it. None of it were special sashimi, we didn't end up finishing them because we felt very gross by it. Plus, there were also fruit flies flying around, which is very gross when you're trying to have raw seafood, come on!Second of all, our waitress was only okay. Not very attentive, very soft spoken so when she quickly introduced each sashimi we're like huh? I like when they bring out Omakase dishes one by one, this way you get to enjoy them and not having a bunch of raw seafood sitting on your table for an hour. Lastly, we asked at the end that if I get a little treat for my birthday, maybe ice cream or ? The waitress told me Omakase doesn't come with dessert. Yes, I know. So of course it was kinda embarrassed to ask again, but I did, because I always get some kind of ice cream or dessert from Japanese Restaurant when I go on my birthday. The waitress told me that they don't but they can put a candle on the ice cream if I want to order.So, for spending over $160 for 2 people. I feel very stupid for picking this place for my birthday.
Brinda G.}Manhattan, NY}11}76}1}-1}3}11/3/2011}The sushi here is quite good, but the choices for the lunch menu are highly limited. I expected a much better a la carte menu, and instead there were these packaged meals that I had to choose from, none of which I really wanted at the time. There needed to be more variety. The sushi itself is quite good, but I've had better. The prices are very decent. Accessible neighborhood. All in all, I give it a 3 out of 5.
David X.}San Mateo, CA}158}33}4}-1}4}10/21/2011}Intimate and welcoming, a restaurant that feels right. The sushi isn't the best I've had, but it certainly doesn't disappoint. The Miso soup is odd (added spices) and when I didn't drink it the sushi chef (we sat at the bar) was shocked (but not appalled). Its all around a good place to go alittle off the beaten st. marks path and offers a much quieter and cozy feel. This is for the older age group as most of the college teens and after work happy hours are down at kenka, taisho, etc. the wait staff was nice, except for my waitress she wasn't helpful when I asked about the sake. She had no knowledge on the sake list, didn't offer to check, didn't help when I asked about how many she though I needed (at least lie to me, tell me I need 2 or say just try 1 don't say you don't know and stare at me-like-i-justgotoutofprison...argh!)
Samuel M.}Manhattan, NY}64}404}44}-1}3}10/8/2011}This is authentic sushi. The chefs are known because they don't speak to you.  We ordered the chef omakase, we were hopping to be served each piece like some omakases in Midtown, but the chef served all the sushis at once in the bar. Maybe that is the traditional omakase. The quality is good, fresh fish in the East Vilage, but even with that Midtown's Sushiden is fresher.   We weren't really excited about the sushi, so we asked for a fatty tuna sashimi. That was really good. Different textures and cuts in a simple tuna sashimi. Go for the sashimi. I don't remember if the sake was good or not, it was ok, forgettable. Eat sashimi without sake, and drink sake afterwards at Decibel Bar, a basement in the same street.  Good place, pricey but cheaper than Midtown, the chefs and waiters don't speak english.I would go back but i'm finding better sushi around.
Lisa C.}Miami Beach, FL}326}131}1}-1}4}10/7/2011}Great food, great value. Perfect neighborhood staple. No fuss no scene just really great fresh sushi. I went for lunch with a friend and had a lovely meal, felt full and spent less than $20. Absolutely go. Totally worth checking out.
Mike O.}Brooklyn, NY}209}1722}570}-1}3}10/2/2011}If you're coming to eat the sushi, I would go somewhere else. There are too many options on this part of the island to eat ho-hum* sushi, weakly rolled and with far fewer options than other places. However, if you want to visit a Japanese food restaurant, I would highly recommend this place. Three star sushi, four star everything else. Unfortunately, the three stars trumps the four in this one, important category.The dinner salad was simple but incredible with its sesame dressing. The red miso soup is strong and an interesting option for a change. The fried tofu is nice and served in a delicious sauce.And then there was the sushi. It was such a disappointment, my wife and I were pining for Marumi just a short walk away.The desert menu made us change our minds and realize the real weakness of this place is simply the sushi, and that's it. We ordered some fantastic green tea ice cream and syphone coffee.The ambience was an interesting mix of middle aged and youngish folk. The service was polite and not overattentive (as some Japanese places can feel, no?)Go for the Japanese. Skip the sushi.(*Ho-hum in the mediocre sense, not any Japanese words, at least not any Japanese I know, and I know very little.)
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}3}10/1/2011}I've tried most of the Japanese restaurants in the St. Marks/9th Street area, so noticed this hidden restaurant and made my way down to try it. It was lunchtime, and their lunch menu seemed rather limited to me, so I settled for an una-ju, which came with rice and salad. Solid food and friendly service, but nothing special or memorable so I'm not sure that I'll be back.
J P.}Brooklyn, NY}0}33}0}-1}4}9/17/2011}Hasaki (currently) has a A rating again, up from a C a few months back. Apparently, these ratings do serve a purpose. I used to go to Hasaki more often then I do nowadays, but I must say their sushi has always been one of the best in the East Village. If you like rare kinds of fish and enjoy expert preparation, then Hasaki is the place to go to. Just don't expect the grumpy sushi chef to talk to you, unless you speak Japanese. Prices are elevated, but reasonably so. If you just want cheap (and good) "regular" sushi, go nextdoor to Sharaku.
David C.}Brooklyn, NY}31}151}14}-1}5}9/17/2011}Hasaki is the benchmark for good sushi in New York City.  I've been here at least a dozen times over the past 15 years--on my first visit I sat next to Joey Ramone!---and it's consistently very good or excellent.  It's not extravagant (or extravagantly overpriced) but the sushi is consistently fresh and served in a simple, serene and, most importantly, authentically Japanese setting.  The service is polite and efficient.  Go.
Alexis C.}Brooklyn, NY}3}4}0}-1}5}8/23/2011}This place is amazingly fresh, the sushi chefs at the bar are professionals and the service is fantastic.  Sit at the left side of the bar, most days the chef there is absolutely amazing.
Dominick Q.}Manhattan, NY}493}193}39}-1}1}8/14/2011}GAH!  Saw the first "C" inspection grade I'd ever seen posted in Hasaki's window!  Was really looking forward to trying it with the cool scene and # of quality reviews.But when you're dealing with sushi, I am NOT playing this game of Russian Roulette!Health inspection specifics listed here:  a816-restaurantinspectio…Come on guys, clean it up!
Johnny D.}Spring Valley, NV}1}22}0}-1}1}7/13/2011}First, these people will never speak good English, and they will think it's your problem for not speaking their language.The chief also seem very arrogant towards certain demographic of people.This guy wears this disturbing fake smile while insulting customers.What I overheard -Customer: "I heard Sushi knifes are expensive, how much does that knife cost?"Main sushi chef "that's non of your business."Conclusion,The guy makes my stomach uncomfortable - so for food review, they get a 0 stars.
Marcia P.}Manhattan, NY}38}172}41}-1}2}7/13/2011}I was underwhelmed.The place had a bug-spray smell and a depressing, quiet vibe. They  have a "grade pending" rating (already had plans to meet friends here or I might've left upon seeing that).Sushi was incredibly small; not just normal small, but minuscule small, with large prices. Acceptably fresh, but not outstandingly so. Eel wasn't warm or very tasty.I can't dream of a reason on earth to go back...
SeaChi N.}Manhattan, NY}0}31}0}-1}3}6/8/2011}Stopped here for a mid-week dinner.  Grilled Organic Salmon was as good as it gets however it only comes with a bowl of rice and a choice of soup or salad.  My fiancee got sashimi and the portions are very small... very small.
dora c.}New York, NY}8}2}9}-1}5}6/8/2011}We alway go there once a week for their old fashion way of making sushi! Best way to make tempulas. Fresh seafood, highly recomm to people who love original japenses style sushi, no rainbow roll if that's what you looking for, just go to those other japanese restaurants in vilage. Got different special menu each night, yeh sometimes they repeat but so what? Been there for more than three years and never let us down.
Jen L.}San Jose, CA}142}16}1}-1}5}5/5/2011}One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in NYC because it's about as authentic as I've seen so far. The miso soup is different, but better, because there's just more flavor to it. They also have seafood chawamushi, which is steamed eggs with various seafood ingredients in it. I hardly ever see in Japanese restaurants in the US serve it. It's nostalgic because it's something I ate while growing up.If you're looking for Americanized sushi rolls, you won't find them here. Hasaki serves authentic Japanese cuisine.
Vanessa S.}Seattle, WA}983}572}739}18}3}4/28/2011}Great sushi place in St Marcs, with a good selection of sake as well.
Sharad K.}Jersey City, NJ}11}33}2}-1}5}4/2/2011}Easily one of the best sushi restaurants in Manhattan.The food quality rivals their more expensive competitors (think Ushiwakamaru, etc.)
Paigee C.}New York, NY}6}78}4}-1}4}3/23/2011}Sushi and sashimi is very fresh. Wait-staff is nice and attempts to please but are inexperienced. Space is small and perfect for date or group of four. Prices are about $35/person with tips included. I recommend trying any of their specials for two, etc. it will not disappoint.
Kaia V.}Berkeley, CA}523}882}839}18}4}3/16/2011}I went looking for the best miso cod in the city. Unfortunately, it was not at Hasaki. We ordered an array of items from their specials menu, including fried rainbow trout, which was pretty delicious despite the tiny bones that were left in the fillets. They sell two different types of tamago - one is the traditional omelet and the other is more like a honey cake. Both were amazing. The sashimi tuna was probably the freshest and most delicious I've had in NYC. The miso cod was good, but it was such a small piece that there was hardly anything to enjoy. This place has definite potential for its sushi, but for cooked items, I prefer elsewhere.
Kevin C.}Stanford, CA}444}36}0}-1}5}1/17/2011}yeah...I love the early bird special.  it's a tiny place and it's usually packed, but I've had good experiences here the three times I've been.fresh, authentic Japanese food.
Lauren B.}New York, NY}482}389}60}-1}5}1/14/2011}I'm getting cranky because I'm on a diet. In an effort to reward myself for all my good eating habits recently, I went to have a hot toddy (yes, I know there is a ton of sugar in honey and scotch) with Carolyn W. She started having hunger pangs and I could feel mine coming on too, so we decided to do dinner. I wanted to eat out, but also didn't want to totally blow the diet so we settled on some sushi. I knew this place was just around the corner from Shoolbreds (house of hot toddys) and we walked on over. I had been here once before with my big time foodie friend Dave K. and I couldn't quite remember if it was good or not, but I know Dave doesn't mess around with his food, especially raw fish, so in we went. Carolyn and I decided to split the bluefin appetizer, which was just some basic sashimi, but damn was it good. I was pumped for our gigantic sushi plate we had ordered. Waiting for the sushi, my excitement mounts. Oh man I can see other people getting their food, and it looks fresh and they look like they are really enjoying it. Nom nom. Our fish arrived a few moments later and we dove right in. The tuna and salmon were fresh and perfect. The fluke and horse mackerel were equally perfect. Then Carolyn made me try her Uni. I politely declined. I love sushi, but I am honeslty not super adventerous with raw fish and I couldn't remember if Uni was sea urchin or not, and I thought it was best to just let that one go. Well, Carolyn is a pain in the you know what and made me try it. First thought was "damn her". I popped the whole thing in my mouth and prepared myself to grimace. My second thought was "oh, this is sort of...nice...good, even..." Third thought was "how do I tell Carolyn how amazing this is without her saying I told you so?"My dilemma was short lived and Carolyn is always polite, and when she saw that I was enjoying it so much she laughed and said "I love it too!" Thanks, dude. The uni wasn't even the best part of the whole meal. I saved that for last because that's what you're supposed to do. The sea scallop sushi was probably the best piece of sushi I have ever tasted. Water parted and doves flew into a sunset as I tasted it. I couldn't believe the buttery texture and freshness in that one small bite. I had to ground myself back to reality so I could quickly flag the waitress and order more. The whole table tried it and I think they would all agree that they too could hear angels singing. As with so many magical and amazing dishes, they don't come cheap. Uni is always costly beause it's labor intensive to harvest it, but everything else was pretty costly as well. I was a bit shocked at the final bill and had never intended spending that much at dinner, but hey, good sushi is usually worth the high price. As if the biblical sea scallop sushi was not enough to entice you to try Hasaki, listen to this:I encountered, yet again, one of those Japanese toilets. They are amazing and 100% worth noting in a review. They vibrate, clean you, dry you, warm your ass, babysit your kids and do your taxes. Okay, the last two I am not absolutely sure the toilet can do, but it might. You never know. It even puts the toilet seat up and down with the push of a button. Gentleman, you have no excuse to leave the seat up. Sushi win.
Tavie P.}Brooklyn, NY}113}38}0}-1}4}1/9/2011}Was introduced to this place by my very picky Japanophile sister who lived in Japan for 3 years and knows her sushi. Hasaki has probably the best Japanese food I've had in the city. Not giving the full 5 stars simply because I think the prices are on the high side for the portion sizes - but I'm torn, because the food really is delicious, very fresh and exquisitely prepared, good presentation. Our waiter was a little rushed and not as attentive as I would've liked, but that's the most minor of quibbles.They had this assorted sushi appetizer that was just divine: pickled squid, smoked spicy cod roe, kelp-cured mullet roe, oiled baby octopus & fluke liver, all centered around a tiny, exquisite little bowl of salted squid guts - I know how it sounds, but paired with warm saki it was absolutely divine. I can't stop thinking about it. And there was this salad with tiny, crispy sardines and a light tomato-sauce-like dressing.I just really, really enjoyed the meal there and would definitely go back when I have the funds to spend.
Charlotte B.}Baltimore, MD}26}153}1}-1}4}12/8/2010}Mellow vibe.  It's a teeny-tiny place just below street level, PERFECT for a relaxing lunch.  The combo sets were completely satisfying and delicious.  The hot soba noodles and sushi were both superb, many places don't do both equally well, this is the exception!
Danielle M.}New York, NY}1}27}14}-1}5}12/4/2010}Phenomenal!Some of the best authentic sushi I've ever had in the world!Chefs will LOVE this place, especially with all the exotic specials that are otherwise unavailable even in NYC.If you are squeamish or prefer sushi with all kinds of sauces and crunch stick to the more traditional rolls etc. that we find in America but I strongly urge you to get adventurous here!
Jackie S.}Milpitas, CA}419}1462}2091}18}5}11/13/2010}WOWOW! This is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've eaten. My hubby and I ate here on a Wednesday night, and we were surprised how packed this place was. We waited 15-20 minutes for a table.I really enjoyed the special touch of the warm hand towel when we arrived to the table.We ordered the following for dinner:+ Vegetable Tempura Appetizer ($10) - Okay.. I was a bit disappointed to see the small portion size of the tempura. There was like 6 pieces of vegetables. At least the batter was good.+ Combo Sushi & Sashimi for 2 ($54) - We had CA rolls, spicy tuna rolls, toro, tuna, salmon, and more. Yum yum yum. I love the salmon and the toro. Oh goodness. They were so creamy, fatty, and fresh! I savored every moment of eating the sashimi and sushi. Best sashimi ever!! Definitely recommend the salmon and/or toro.In addition, the combo comes with either miso soup or salad. We had the miso soup and it is really hearty. I've never tasted miso soup like this before, but the flavor was intense.Service was good. Our tea cups were always refilled, and we weren't overly bothered by the waiters.Yes, the prices are a bit high, but the quality is great! I still dream about those toro and salmon sashimi. Nom nom nom.
Red J.}New York, NY}189}259}6}-1}4}11/8/2010}Not impressed with the rock shrimp appetizer.  But I did enjoy everything else!  My white peach cocktail was yummy and so what the lychee one the bf got.  I got the Kasisen Don, which is the chef's selection of the best fish of the day and bf got the Udon Soup.  The fish in my Kasisen Don was delicious and fresh.  Awesome quality and great selection.  They included uni, mackerel, yellowtail, and octopus just to name a few.  It was a great deal and also the rice was awesome!  They didn't just do sushi rice, they flavored the rice with some other seasoning with made it extra yummy!  I actually was able to finish my entire bowl, and I was stuffed after.  Bf's udon was pretty tasty too, esp the soup.  I really enjoyed this meal.  On top of the great food and good drinks, the service here is great too.  Nice spot for good sushi that isn't too too pricey.
Martin W.}Brooklyn, NY}173}591}431}18}2}10/12/2010}I do not know, what the fuck is up when a sushi joint in the East Village closes at 11:30pm on a Friday night. Maybe that's my shit. My friend Martin, yes I have a friend with the same first name. He recommended this place so I said lets give it a try. We couldn't sit at the sushi bar because we arrived shortly after 11pm and they had started cleaning up. So we got a table in this cramped space. I am 6' 2" and I know what cramped feels like. We ordered 2 - seaweed salad v v good 1 - kinuta eel good 3 - sashimi maguro I also had, 2 - sashimi toro = v good 2 - sashimi kanpachi = v good 2 - sashimi japan mackerel = v good 2 - sashimi scallop = v good The seaweed salad was really good, but the sashimi servings were small for the price. I mean come on you are charging top dollar. Shit the bill came out to $90 and I was still hungry. So I went down the block and had to get some more sashimi. Eight pieces for $10.99 what a bargain. I have been to better places, even if they offered some type of sexual gratification with the bill I would not have been satisfied. The only way I would come back here is if they added Geisha girls to go with the sashimi. Only then would I get my moneys worth.
Alice C.}Los Angeles, CA}237}226}0}-1}4}10/12/2010}Always top quality fish.  Presentation and quality are spot-on, though for some reason, I've never had particularly good service here, over the course of five or six years.  Additionally, I've had a few instances of wasabi-overkill (hidden under pieces of fish and between the rice). Overall, reliable and satisfying.
Laura H.}New York, NY}1}22}2}-1}5}8/29/2010Updatedreview}LOVE THIS PLACE! It is cheaper to go for lunch.. Dinner are great as well.. min. of $30 per person with tip.
Sue F.}New York, NY}15}119}2}-1}4}8/24/2010}This is my absolute favorite sushi place in the world. I have been coming here probably longer than I have frequented any other restaurant, and for good reason. Always delicious! Always worth the wait. They also have the most unique miso soup I have ever had.
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}4}7/19/2010}Hasaki is such an unassuming spot that even though I'd passed by its doors dozens upon dozens of times, I still didn't know just where it was when my friend suggested it for dinner.  The answer?  Across the street from my brother's freshman dorm, where I had visited him multiple times.As it turns out, Hasaki is a lovely cozy little sushi bar.  Though it lacks the glamor and air of celebration of some better known New York sushi joints, the food is much better than you would find at your average neighborhood restaurant.  It's simple but well-executed with fresh ingredients.  Though Hasaki is not the kind of place to go out of your way for, it is a solid spot for a sushi fix, the sort to attract local regulars.There was a short wait, but we were seated without any hassle and the service was polite and pretty efficient.  The restaurant was on the quiet side, small but fairly open, with no two tables invading each other's space.  The food was good to impressive.  I was with two friends and we went family style.  We ordered the negi toro tartare, the grilled black cod, the salmon oyako don, and a combination of sushi and sashimi for one.The two larger dishes came with a choice of miso soup or salad, and we shared two miso soups.  This was surprisingly good, heartier and more sour than your standard, with a definite citrus tang.  It came with a generous amount of little tofu cubes.  We then had the negi toro tartare and the grilled black cod, and both were fantastic.  The negi toro tartare was fresh and delicious, with a healthy dose of luscious toro and chopped scallions.  The wasabi was also excellent, dissolving in an even crumble in soy sauce.  The grilled black cod was super buttery and flaky with great mellow flavor.  The appetizer portion was very small.The salmon oyako don was a fantastic dish I'd never had before.  "Oyako don" generally refers to a rice bowl made with chicken and egg, "oyako" meaning "parent and child."  A salmon oyako don is similar in concept but with more suited to a sushi restaurant - instead of chicken and egg, you get salmon and salmon roe, also known as sake and ikura.  Hasaki's version offered salmon seared to a tender pink, along with brilliant briny bursts of ikura.  The portion of both salmon and ikura was rather generous, and served over sushi rice, it made for a substantial and delectable dish.The combination of sushi and sashimi came with one piece each of ikura, shrimp, unagi, and toro, along with two pieces each of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and hirame.  There were also little rolls of cucumber and tuna.  This wasn't the ideal item for splitting, but it worked out, and everything I tried was pretty good.  The unagi was toasty and not slathered in sauce, though I suppose a little more moisture would have been nice.  The salmon was superb, nice and fatty with zero sinew.  I also ordered a piece of uni a la carte, and this was wonderful, slippery cold and refreshingly creamy and oceanic.Overall, Hasaki didn't knock me out of my seat but I was pleased with the quality of fish and the prepared dishes were well done.  I would definitely come back if I lived in the area.  The place is also not too bad price-wise, if not exactly a bargain.  I lost credit card roulette and the pre-tip total was under $100 for our party of three.  You can certainly do much worse for good sushi in New York.
Nobuko K.}Woodside, NY}94}22}42}-1}4}6/17/2010}This restaurant is one of the oldest Japanese restaurant in New York. My first visit was 20 years ago. I saw the chef change many time but the owner is still same (same as decibel, sakagura, soba-ya, cha-an and curry-ya). Hasaki is always tries to serve fresh foods in reasonable price.My last visit was last Saturday. I sat down on the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very helpful and server was very attentive. Sushi was good.I'm sure I'll go back Hasaki again.
Krista M.}Kew Gardens, NY}338}669}224}18}4}6/13/2010}A friend of mine suggested Hasaki, saying it was her favorite place. So off we went. Atmosphere: It is located in the basement, but visable from the street. It is a fairly small place with both tables and a sushi bar. The staff was friendly and attentive. The menu isn't very large but has both sushi and typical Japanese dishes. We started off with the seaweed salad, It was my first time having it and it was actually pretty good. It comes with maybe 5 different types of seaweed and this very tasty creamy dressing on the side. We moved onto the shrimp tempura appetizer, which was light and crispy and not greasy. It includes 2 shrimp and a piece of sweet potato, broccoli and eggplant. After that we ordered some rolls. I got the spicy tuna roll, an eel roll and a piece of tuna sushi. It was all very good. Everything tasted fresh and it was well made. We didn't have time for dessert, but I was told they have good sesame ice cream and coffee, which is brewed with a Bunsen burner looking thing at your table . So tha's a must try for next time.
Mickey M.}New York, NY}0}185}0}-1}1}5/28/2010}Dull staff who are unobservant and RUDE.Space is tiny and the tables are cramped together.We had the grilled teriyaki salmon and the eel rice.  The salmon came with sauce on the side.  Said sauce was tasteless, as was the fish.  The eel rice was drowned in its own sauce and [the sauce] was really the only thing you could taste.Bill came to about $50, which is exorbitant for the ambiance, service, and food that you get here.  THIS IS NO NOBU!
Timothy L.}New York, NY}5}14}0}-1}5}5/18/2010}I came here on Saturday, 5/15/10 with my girlfriend and a friend who was visiting from out of town...  I have been here on several occasions through the years, but I always seem to forget how nice the restaurant is, and how good the food is.  My favorite thing to do when going out for sushi is to order the Omakase, or chef's choice because I hate going through the pain of deciding what to order.We were all in the mood to burn some money on good sushi so we ended up ordering the sushi and sashimi combination for 2 and the Shokado, which is a combination of sushi, sashimi, and cooked food.  This all included miso soup, or a small salad.  My friend and I opted for the miso soup which was a thick aka (red) miso soup, which you don't see too often.  My girlfriend chose the salad, which was dressed with the typical carrot ginger dressing.Out first after the soup and salad, came the sashimi platter, which was very fresh, and beautifully presented.  It had toro, horse mackerel, a different fluke that I can't remember, white salmon, smoked sea trout, snapper, scallop, and baby abalone.  All were wonderful.  The baby abalone was nicer than I had expected because when I was I Japan, I had awabi which is just regular abalone, it was like chewing on plastic.  Also, on the platter was freshly grated real wasabi along with undyed pickled ginger, and pickled daikon radish.Next came the Shokado platter which included some of the same fish as the sashimi platter, but adding yellowtail scallion rolls, kampyo rolls, shad, uni, ikura (salmon roe), mackerel, marinated tuna, marinated clam, miso marinated grilled black cod, deep fried soft shelled crab.Lastly was the sushi platter which had more of the same fish, but adding some sort of sweet clam sushi, ume shiso rolls, more uni, marinated tuna, and an interesting very cakey omelette.I'm sure I'm missing a few things here, but I assure you all that we left very satisfied and full, which are not necessarily synonymous with Japanese restaurants.So if you are in the mood to splurge, and don't want to bother with trying to get reservations at Momofuku Ko, or Nobu, you should check this place out.  It's some of the finest sushi anywhere.
Tatsuya Y.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}4}5/18/2010}A little pricier than other places (like Sharaku which is right next door) and maybe not as famous or trendy as other but this is quite possibly my favorite sushi place in NYC.  The fish tastes very fresh, the rice to fish ratio on their sushi and rolls is near perfection.  Too much of either and it disturbs the balance of taste.
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}3}5/3/2010}Lets just make it a Japanese weekend. I had sushi last night at Nori, and tonight I wanted more. The steep prices and mediocre service kind ruined my experience, but the food was delicious. Hijiki salad - deliciousRed miso paste soup - a little too saltyBlack miso cod appetizer - not as tasty as MatsuriOtyako Salmon Don with Salmon roe - rice was cold, and salmon was decentSashimi & Sushi combo for 1 - The fish was not the freshest.Tempura battered ginko nuts and pumpkin squash - tasty and fried well.All of this for three people and one bottle of rice wine came out to 125 dollars.
Marc O.}New York, NY}0}14}0}-1}5}4/11/2010}I'm a big fan of simplicity, especially when it comes to sushi.  If you need to gussy up your sushi with macadamia nuts or spinach or marshmallows or some crap like that, you really don't know what you're doing.Fish and rice.  Simple.  Done well, it's sublime.Hasaki has it nailed.  Sure, the portions are small and it's a bit on the pricey side, but I'm happy to pay for perfection.  This will be my default sushi place going forward.
Jane H.}Queens, NY}30}1222}12}18}4}4/10/2010}I thoroughly enjoyed my food! While it is a little more pricey than some other places you can go, it has good quality. I had the grilled tuna, and the meat was just perfect! BF had the blowfish, which was so sweat! Also it came with some young gingko beans, which I never had young (they were green!).We also had a grilled banana with ice cream and we chose the sesame ice cream. A very good sesame ice cream with a roughly ground up sesame, so it had a good texture and flavor!I may come back again, but maybe when I am feeling more rich or when I am feeling like eating sushi. Sake is strong.
Athena C.}San Francisco, CA}925}1562}681}18}4}4/9/2010}Fresh high quality sushi that simply melts in your mouth! It is a bit pricey than other Japanese restaurants. Sushi for two is $50 but it does fill me up without ordering appetizers or other side dishes. I probably won't come here regularly but I absolutely love coming here once a while to indulge in fabulous sushi.
Daisy P.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}2/1/2010}First time at Hasaki and it was amazing. From the Shumai to the Sushi, it was all great. I love the fact that you can order spicy chicken teriyaki. I  haven't seen that at other sushi restaurants, or perhaps, I just haven't paid attention, but nonetheless, it was tasty. My boyfriend loved the steamed monk fish liver w/Ponzu sauce which you can find on their daily specials menu.
Anna H.}Brooklyn, NY}27}125}17}-1}4}1/26/2010}A friend of ours recommended this place to us to try their $20 twilight dinner.  It is important to get here before 6:30 p.m. to get this special deal.  We left with a smile on our face and a full stomach.  The food and service were excellent.  I will be back.
Wen L.}Queens, NY}16}21}24}-1}3}1/20/2010}First time at Hasaki, this would've made my first 5 star review. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to review it until I went back there again. My first experience was incredible. I am not a big fan of raw foods with raw fish being practically at the bottom of my list. But I've started accepting it and when a friend took me to Hasaki, I was tremendously surprised plus a bit relieved. I thought to myself, 'So, THIS is what sashimi is supposed to taste like! It's not me!' Now, I've been to Tokyo and wasn't impressed there. So you see how Hasaki really has got me raving.(what I had: Shrimp Tempura, Sashimi for two which was INCREDIBLE but I can't name what I had, Black Cod)Second time there, I had several instances where the piece of sashimi was too fishy for me. We had ordered Sushi and Sashimi Omakase for 2 (tuna and chutoro was awesome), age tofu (really good), Basil Salmon (just ok), Garlic Beef (great), Grilled Banana (very good + interesting). In both instances, however, service was excellent. And make good use of their bathroom, the warm seat is the best. I must get one at home. Note: They cannot accommodate groups over 8. It is a small space so I would stick to no more than 6 people.
WeiKay L.}Flushing, NY}74}23}72}-1}5}1/14/2010}one of the best sushi places in the NYC. It can be pricier than most Japanese restaurant, but definitely worth the price!!
Chih-Yu S.}Brooklyn, NY}25}42}110}-1}4}1/2/2010}Good place to go for fresh Sushi. In winter, we like to order Nabeyaki noodle soup. The lunch menu price is worth while to try.
Allison H.}Jersey City, NJ}312}575}9}-1}3}12/28/2009}In my mind, there are two types of East Villagers, those who go to Kanoyama and those wh go to Hasaki.  My friend just moved to the hood and has been yelping behind my back, so when i suggested Kanoyama which is 2 blocks closer to my apartment, she retorted that everyone knows that Hasaki is better.  Well now having been to both, Hasaki is different, not necessarily better.  They don't have the "crazy" rolls i usually go for, like 5 different kinds of fish woven into one roll, but they have simpler and definitely more beautiful dishes.  We ordered the Five sushi, which with an additional roll was enough to fill two of us.  The woman next to me got this eel appetizer in cucumber that looked amazing.  The miso soup is really pungent (perhaps more authentic) but it was too much for me to.  Also my friend said this is normal, but i never realized that the fish and rice are held together by wasabi.........i've never tasted a hint of wasabi on my sushi any place else, but here it really came out-and i hate wasabi-just a helpful hint for my fellow wasabi haters.
avi d.}New York, NY}18}115}0}-1}4}12/1/2009}Ever since a bad experience at Lan (now closed indefinitely for renovations it seems) I've needed a new go to Japanese place within walking distance of my apartment. Enter Hasaki. The décor isn't as nice as Lan, the service not as polished, there's no regular bar, it's a bit more of a pain to get a table but in spite of this I have so far never had anything but great meals there.The regular menu is a little limited in some respects, it doesn't overwhelm with choices and funky takes on things just solid Japanese food done well. Every appetizer I've tried I've though were well thought out, and excellently executed (try the garlic beef or spicy chicken). Every entrée I've had I've enjoyed immensely, excellent sushi, good udon and soba, and solid if not spectacular grilled seafood. The specials menu kicks it up into high gear with a large bunch of changing items that have yet to disappoint. The waitstaff are hip Japanese kids who are way cooler than you or me but don't act it too much, service is diligent but not necessarily warm. The décor is a little better than generic for this type of place in this type of location. Well worth the reasonable check
Seung Eun C.}Los Angeles, CA}498}879}1131}18}3}11/5/2009}Following the advice of a friend who hails Hasaki as one of the best sushi joints, we stumbled upon it and decided to try out a few pieces despite being pretty full from an earlier dinner.First things first, this place is really clean and the bathroom is very Japanese meaning, they had one of the multitasking toilets.  If you push a button it'll warm the rim, spray water to clean you, etc...  I wasn't really into it..Onto the food...My husband wanted otoro, but they only had chutoro which they claimed was of the same premium quality.  He took the bait and said it was good but lacked graining so it didn't really melt in your mouth.  The price???  $9 for a single (not two) piece of sushi and the cut of the fish was way small....I guess we're spoiled being from LA and having Sushi Gen as our "go to" joint that provides the highest quality no nonsense sushi at affordable prices.I had the ume roll which is plum paste, cucumbers, and shiso, which was really good.  The oshinko plate consisted of takuan (pickled radish), cucumbers, and some lotus roots which was the best.  The only problem was that it was WAY 2 SMALL!!So this place is pretty good and I'm sure if you've got $ to burn, it can be really good.  We spent $70 on a few pieces of sushi and some sake.  Kinda pricey but definitely worth it at the time.
Big Easy K.}New York, NY}6}87}31}-1}5}10/27/2009}I have been going here for many years and I have always been a huge fan.  I can tell you honestly that I have spent many thousands of dollars here - perhaps the most telling endorsement I can offer.  Sushi chefs and wait staff (several I consider friends) have come and gone...kitchen staff have come and gone...even the crusty manager who was there since it opened in the 80's left a few years back to return to Japan. Regardless of these changes, this place continues to deliver the goods!  Great food (both sushi bar & kitchen) and I have only had ONE slight problem with the service in ALL that time, due to an unfortunate but forgivable language breakdown.The little things mean a lot and this is where they excel:- For example, shrimp dumplings don't sound so exciting, but their version has this grated batter and they are GOOD.  - Another example is that the miso soup rocks - it's dark, red miso, NOT the standard tired old miso that's pretty much everywhere else.  - Ever order a salad at a Japanese restaurant?  Let me guess,  they almost always have the EXACT same carrot/ginger dressing (that's frequently too sweet), right?  Well, the salad dressing here is awesome and a bit tangy.  If they bottled it, they would have another solid revenue stream.- Ever order a pickle plate (oshinko)? It's almost always the same right?  Some yellow, some orange, some green.  Well, at this place it's a bit different and unique - not knowing the names, I'll just say they have more diverse colors. - This was the first place I ever ran across rolls wrapped in cucumber (they call them "Kinuta") which are terrific.  - They always have some unique fish and the basics are always terrific.- Their daily specials always have something that actually are special.    For example, as Winter approaches it will be a variety of mushroom preparations.- The current senior sushi chef has his own take - I believe they call it Tokyo-style sushi.  It is unique (soy marinated tuna, a well executed, labor intensive tamago and several other tasty inclusions that you don't even need soy sauce for) and well-worth trying for the change of pace alone. - Everything is well presented.  Yep, as some reviewers have pointed out, the sushi/sashimi can be on the small side, meaning THEY DO NOT serve the gargantuan, "biggy-sized" sushi served at several other establishments (NOT in Japan)...and you have to wonder how some of those other restaurants can afford to give you such large pieces(?).  So my advice is to order a couple appetizers/side dishes if you're hungry.  If someone in your group doesn't like the raw stuff, the kitchen food is solid...even the chicken teriyaki kicks butt.  I don't avail myself of it, but they also have a $20 early bird that is a pretty sweet bargain, including a bit of everything.My last point is that the Zagat food ratings for Hasaki are definitely 2 points lower than deserved (22 should be 24)...trust me, I didn't get fat off of eating at McDonald's.To repeat, the little things add up to something far greater in total...and that's what this place has always accomplished.  Maybe I shouldn't have been so glowing with the review...so do me a favor and just don't get there before I do.
ka wai c.}New York, NY}1}16}4}-1}5}10/21/2009}I just moved to manhattan from Los Angeles and looking for some good jap restaurant like Hama sushi in J-town and I-naba in Torrance which offers good quality food while not costing you an arm and a leg. So I visited hasaki with my girlfriend for lunch. This is what I am looking for! Good food and service! I truly think this place is under rated. If you are looking for good jap food for a reasonable price, go hasaki.
adam b.}New York, NY}18}49}6}-1}1}8/28/2009}one of the only places in the city with siphon coffee.. they would not serve it to use though even though the restaurant  was empty bc they are "not a cafe"... they are entitled to their 20/pp minimum but were just annoying the way they handled it and treated us- JMO
Sabrina M.}New York, NY}97}157}44}-1}1}8/27/2009}I didn't actually eat here (just had a decently priced glass of champagne while my friends ate), so this review is mostly about the awful service. The manager tried to trick my friend into giving a better tip by telling him the receipt machine made a mistake and that it printed the tax wrong and that he should make up for it by adding (blank) amount of dollars into the tip. Seriously? Does that shit work on people? It was a really awkward experience, and I don't think the tip they were giving was that bad... and even if it was, frankly, it's a tip and its up to the discretion of the person giving it.
Jacob L.}San Francisco, CA}17}169}0}-1}2}7/25/2009}I liked this place years ago, so decided to take my Japanese friend for sushi. It had gone way downhill. She commented that the service was completely un-Japanese (ie: rude). One sushi chef was yelling at a waitress, which is just NOT done. We ordered sushi and sashimi, and the toro was chewy! For those who may not know, toro is supposed to melt in your mouth. Just disappointing all around, and not cheap either. Go elsewhere.
Sarah W.}Brooklyn, NY}415}221}81}-1}5}7/21/2009}Rock Solid Sushi Quality.. Stamped. What more can I say? I have been this place for many years but, everytime I am there, I am pretty surprised about their undying quality over the years. For that fact only, I already give you 5 stars.Quality wise, this is where to get real Japanese Sushi/Sashimi period. But I am talking no BS - straight forward and clean quality comes with the authenticity. Everything is great even with surprisingly simple deco located in basement. Portions are small in every way. It could be quite small to some. But, Rices are properly seasoned and made to stay intact and not angry(?) and fell apart. They don't do tricks like many exotically named rolls or sauces, all that kinds of stuffs that you see in many other non-japanese places. I rememeber the first time we were there, they said no Salmon. yeah, it is true because originally there is no salmon sushi in Japan. Salmon has been added recently since the refrigeration (why? raw salmon has some parasites which need to be treated prior to consumption).Simple and clean and by the book kind of sushi you can expect here in moderate prices. Bidet wise, it is a plus but there are many japanese places in St. Marks have them.... and it is quite common in Asian household these days since the popular Japanese Toilet company Toto mass produces them.
E W.}Brooklyn, NY}206}324}59}-1}4}6/22/2009}When I was little and went to stay with some Francophile relatives in Trinidad, I remember making fun of, and being fascinated by, their bidet.  Hasaki has a bidet-like toilet, or more pointedly a Japanese-style toilet with warming water jets and an air blower.  But enough about bathrooms, you don't go to Hasaki for the bathrooms.  You go to Hasaki for their sushi, the slightly hidden and quiet location and the large teacups with Sumo Wrestlers etched into the sides.  I've been here several times with a friend of mine.  We both order the very tasty, rich and "brothy" (that's totally not a word) Miso, then split a plate of sushi, rolls and sashimi...and when I say split, I mean she eats the sushi and the rolls and I eat the sashimi.  Occasionally, we'll get some fish or spicy chicken; which always makes me smile because I went to high school with a girl someone had dubbed, "Spicy Chicken," (as in, "dude, that is the spiciest chicken I have ever seen!").  Their servers know what they're doing, and they do it very well.  No attitude, no raised eyebrow at the ordering of a particular dish, no hovering over your table waiting to snatch the check and shoo you out the door.  In short, there's a reason I keep coming back.
Adam W.}San Francisco, CA}11}8}0}-1}5}4/21/2009}the restaurant is cozy, but not too small. warm towel service when i sat down at the bar, and the waiter never had me waiting more than 30 seconds. the fish was delish, as was the miso soup. the sushi chef's presentation was unique for each plate he created....a nice touch. i also had mochi with red beans and ice cream which topped off a completely satisfactory dining experience.
Jason K.}New York, NY}0}37}0}-1}5}4/8/2009}service: impeccable. Ambiance: average.Price: moderate, and worth every penny.Food: My wife has a discriminating palate, and is not prone to hyperbole, and she still claims that Hasaki is the best Japanese food she has ever eaten outside of the homeland. The unagi, the udon the tempura and the miso were total successes. Even the simple tuna sushi roll tasted better than the other places. All of it was absolutely incredible. I am literally going to leave this review with those words and promptly go reduce every other Japanese restaurant i've rated by one star.
Jo K.}Brooklyn, NY}4}38}3}-1}5}2/26/2009}This is one of my favorite sushi places in Manhattan. It's simply a reliable place for fresh fish and polite service. Also, their bathroom is one of the most pleasant in the city. It  is SUPER clean with an authentic Japanese toilet that warms and washes your behind (if you roll that way... which is more sanitary). And It's only a stone's throw away from the famous St. Mark's bookstore, located in an under-the-sidewalk location. I always order the kinuta eel (eel wrapped in cucumber) and for an entree I either order one of the specials or the omakase (chef's selection). And there's some good sake here.The prices are pretty damn reasonable for those days you want to indulge yourself a little. But then again I'm biased. I always pay more for sushi than for American food. I'm so food racist.
Kelly B.}San Diego, CA}234}398}806}-1}4}2/16/2009}Sometimes I like to play my "I'm Japanese" card and encourage my friends to think past sushi - which is only slightly above average here - at Japanese restaurants. Hasaki serves up some of the best homemade nakazuke (rice bran and salt pickles $6) and they get a gold star for their (very affordable!) Vegetable Tempura a La Carte: each $3.5 serving is 3 pieces! They make wonderful lotus root, pumpkin, asparagus, and broccoli tempura.But the very best item on their menu is their outstanding Black Sesame Seed Ice Cream. (Which can also be had at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory)
John T.}New York, NY}8}44}0}-1}4}1/12/2009}Hasaki is what a Manhattan Japanese restaurant should be. Good food. Good ambiance. A touch of class. A rather nice feature about this restaurant is that they do not accept reservations (as far as I know). If you're in the right place at the right time, then you're in for a treat. Hasaki provides excellent quality food with that has been prepared with a lot of thought and love. This can be seen by the simple yet elegant presentation of each dish. I believe I ordered a fish entree with a rather peculiar flavoring as the main meal. It was absolutely scrumptious. I had to mindfully not eat too my food too quickly as to hide my enthusiasm. A small issue was that the portion size felt a little small. Perhaps I was feeling more hungry than normal. But I remember my hunger being not particularly sated with that meal. I'm sure that a dessert would have been in order, had I opted for one. Why didn't I opt for one?! *sigh* The interior design of the restaurant reflects the food as being tasteful and elegant (pun not intended). The lighting is intimate and exudes the air of a "date restaurant." Being that they also serve delicious food doesn't hurt the chances of a successful date either, right? I, too, hope that I can come here again for this purpose in the future.Hasaki, an experience you'd be asking seconds for.
Solomon W.}Austin, TX}535}2583}7}-1}2}1/10/2009}My father brought my brother and I here because he apparently loved some of the dishes here, and with his experience around Manhattan, we assumed it would be killer Japanese food; however, I was a tad disappointed overall in terms of my New York scale.  Sushi offerings here were pretty unique and fresh; we had the sashimi of Bluefin Tuna Toro, which is like the king cut of the king of fish.  Definitely awesome fish, but way pricey.  We also had the Japanese mackerel, which was basically Spanish mackerel.  My dad raved about their salmon teriyaki and their prime beef shabu shabu, but both of these were pretty mediocre to me.  The salmon was perfectly crispy, but had no distinguishing flavor, and the shabu shabu was supposed to be top notch, but I couldn't distinguish anything special in particular about it.  My brother's eel was pretty average, though it wasn't bad or anything.  Overall, a pretty average meal for New York.  Perhaps they were on an off day, but it is in an area that is extremely dense in Japanese cuisine, so maybe they are not the top dog joint in the area.
Kim J.}Washington, DC}2}44}6}-1}5}12/27/2008}Went to this place last night for an annual holiday get-together. The food was amazing. The service was good. Your water glass never gets empty.The miso soup was a tad bit salty; if you're on a sodium restricted diet, avoid that soup.  My group had a large platter of sushi/sashimi and they nearly polished off the entire plate between the two of them. I had the chicken teriyaki. It was delicious with the largest asparagus spears on the side that I have ever seen.  They were perfectly cooked.  The place is expensive, but I think it was money well spent.  You should go. Oh, and the bathroom is amazing .... someone else mentioned that there's a bidet.  The only problem I noted was that the soap dispenser was a bit difficult to get soap out of. They should replace it with something that dispenses soap a lot easier.
Scarlett S.}New York, NY}18}126}0}-1}4}12/17/2008}Yummy! First off let me say, that though this is a small restaurant the seating is very comfortable and intimate. We ordered the salmon with basil miso sauce and it was incredible and the portion was perfectly sized, nice and large for a japanese resturant. We also had the udon noodles and some sashimi which was very fresh. The miso soup was made with red miso and tasted pretty good, though it was a tad bit salty. I would def. go back
Ryan S.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}4}12/14/2008}Never disappoints.  There is typically a wait on the weekend, but we didn't have to wait long on a Saturday night.  The kinuta himachi is awesome.  I've been getting it for 5 years - himachi, shrimp and ginger wrapped in cucumber.  a super refreshing start.  my palate has grown a lot and i usually don't order spicy tuna rolls, but there's has a sesame oil that takes a tuna roll to another level.  highly recommend - hijiki seaweed salad, shrimp dumplings (steamed and like none i've ever had), oshinko, beef negamaki.  if you're like me, i like to order a lot and share everything.  if you're by yourself, try the chirashi don or tuna don.  with a friend?  order several apps and split the sushi five.the prices are a little higher than some of the others in the neighborhood, but the service is always pleasant - not overly attentive and but just enough that you're not on your own.  the food is always consistent (delicious) and worth the price.  they have a great beer and sake selection with some limited alcohol - no bar though.  everything is poured in the back and does not distract from the ambiance.in the summer months, they have a hidden patio in the back (was going for years before i found out).  and, i dont believe they are open on sundays.  if you want a real deal, go on saturday afternoon and order from the lunch menu.  its cheap and not many take advantage, but they stop serving at 3:30, close and reopen for dinner.
Em P.}Long Beach, CA}146}81}2}-1}4}11/22/2008}I've been to Hasaki twice.  The first time was for Valentine's with my BF and we got the Valentine's chef special...It was INCREDIBLE!  We were loving every bite and everything was so pretty.  What was wonderful was the uni - fresh uni, that is, straight from the shell!  We both never liked uni until that night.  Since then, uni just isn't the same, can't get any fresher than that night.  Our second time was last week.  I was so excited to have it since our first experience was so incredible.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't the same experience.  We ordered the omakase and it just wasn't impressive.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it was good, but I guess I was expecting much more.  Maybe we were there at the wrong time.
Jeff C.}New York, NY}1142}1258}14}-1}5}11/17/2008}BEST HIJIKI!!!! AND BEST DINNER VALUE FOR PRIX FIXE Around the bend from Sharaku and downstairs is this hidden gem. The Twilight Dinner here is even a better value than Kamui Den's and up there w/ Basso56's Lunch Special. I kid you not. You get a feast for $20. I went here due to my friend Ting's oh so reliable review. I was going to order the Gindara for $15 but was comfortably full after our meal that I didn't have to. I would highly recommend this deal to those who are interested in an early supper. The quality far surpassed what I would have imagined, as the clientele is predominately caucasian. It doesn't hurt that the green tea was good too =)TWILIGHT DINNER ($20) [5:30pm-6:30pm daily]-Salad - ginger dressing, nothing out of the ordinary-Miso Soup - they used red miso in this, a tad salty as that's standard, very good-7pcs Sashimi (2pcs fluke, 3pcs tuna, 2pcs salmon) - pcs of salmon were small but good, rest were avg-6pcs Tempura (eggplant, 2 shrimp, carrot, fish ball, broccoli) - very light and airy, fresh panko, yum!-Hijiki - BEST HIJIKI I've had to date, better than Soba-Ya's and Tsukushi's!-Steamed fish ball - served in clear broth, very good-Grilled Salmon - a bit more well done than I would have liked, thick chunky piece, just OK-Braised tuna w/ mushrooms - tuna (roughly 4 small pcs) was flavorful, sauce was so good I poured the rest over my rice-Bowl of rice - good rice-Dessert - fresh fruits, or choose from vanilla/green tea/black sesame ice cream (from Ciao Bella) - more like gelato, opted for the black sesame - tasted the seeds!, as the green tea from ciao bella isn't as dark.Total came out to $25/pp after everythingPics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…
Lala L.}New York, NY}5}8}0}-1}4}10/30/2008}This place is inconsistent, but I've had more goods than bads so I'll give it 4 stars.I usually get sushi forte or chirashi when I'm taking out, or get flower garden when dining in. I like the fact that they actually use real ground wasabi and the rice is seasoned well. Although they've ignored my request to have saba replaced with something else on occassion, I'm still a fan of their fresh fish.
Ms G.}New York, NY}111}254}103}-1}4}9/14/2008}i stumbled into this place with my bf after going to the same st marks restaurants time and time again. it's a place that you can easily miss, but we thought we'd give it a shot. the twilight dinner special for $20 was such a good deal! i had so much more food than my bf who ordered the sushi/sashimi combo. i was both satisfied and full after dinner and it was sooooo worth it. i will definitely go back and order it again.
ben -.}New York, NY}17}101}0}-1}5}9/5/2008}I'm glad this place has such mixed reviews -- it'll keep people away. Hasaki is fantastic. The quality of the sushi totally blew me away. I was expecting a mediocre sushi dinner (like the places around it) and what I got was soft, incredibly fresh fish that begins to rival the greats (yasuda, bond st, etc.). The atmosphere is nice and relaxed, not stuffy at all. The service is decent, but not mindblowing. The only real downside is that the a la carte prices are a bit high and the combination plates aren't very good. They have a full menu, so you can grab a bowl of soba and a few pieces of nigiri if you fancy. It's mine, stay away.
Mark M.}West Covina, CA}95}169}0}-1}5}8/4/2008}Now, HERE'S a sushi bar!Please, friends, do yourself a favor and go to a real Japanese sushi restaurant. Like this one. It's totally unassuming and spartan inside (the galley looks like the inside of a shower), but when you walk in, you just "know" that the place is authentic and the people know their sushi.Impeccably fresh. A little on the expensive side, but justifiably so. And they put something in the rice that makes you want more. And more. And more. I think it is, as some people say, "like crack." So I'm a fan of the chirashi, naturally.Oh, and they use REAL WASABI. Not the green toothpaste. YEEEHAAAW! Try something from the special menu. Get the omakase. Get what you normally get anywhere else. Get something you've never heard of before. Any way you point the chopstick, you'll be happy!
Christopher I.}New York, NY}199}183}46}-1}4}7/5/2008}Walked in with date. Sat down. Looked at menu. Checked wallet.No, Hasaki isn't cheap like other members of the East Village sushi clan. Appearances are simple--the sushi chefs work with an unassuming seafoam and cream tile wall at their backs...but they're creating marine marvels with their hands.At Takahachi I love getting a lot of cheap appetizers and generally get the chirashi (mixed sashimi over sushi rice) to finish the meal...but the chirashi always leaves me yearning for better fish. Hasaki has that fish, but it's 7 or 8 dollars more for the chirashi. That said, I rarely splurge for sushi, and if I'm going to, it may as well be good.So I'll be back. (I'm still smarting the loss of Ebisu on 9th though...my favorite. R.I.P.)

Yumiko F.}Brighton, MA}63}104}10}-1}5}4/26/2008}I have not had close to real japanese food taste in a usa for long time. I got to try the lunch menu " Afternoon Plate" which comes with 2 sides ( very small but this is just about right size), tempra, sake(salmon) yaki, miso soup(akadashi), sushi or sashimi, and was $16. for the price, it was really really good. There was few other lunch set with soba or sashimi/sushi set. i recommend you to try. oh and at the end, they will serve you desert. it was fruit but few different kinds. if you can spend a bit money and wants to try real taste of food then please go here! ps. maybe people who thought that miso was bad might never had this Akadashi type of red miso... it of course taste different than you see at other store....( there are several different kind of miso and base you can use to make. so please do not be judgmental! )
Ting S.}Berkeley, CA}338}420}89}-1}5}4/9/2008}Definitely NOT your average East Village 1/2 price sushi place for American-style gluttony! My first visit here was for lite bites and a bottle of sake - about $75 + tip for 2.  Left unexpectedly full, and completely satisfied with the high quality of sashimi. The red miso soup to start was a clear indication that this establishment aimed to serve palates superior to those frequenting the aforementioned 1/2 price joints. The clam sashimi appetizer...drool....granted I am not the most sage nor experienced in high end sushi, but this was deeeeeelicious; 5 varieties of clam, so fresh it was a shame to even dip any pieces in soy sauce, and impeccably cut to highlight the essence of each type of clam.There is a twilight dinner special available until 6:30pm, which i cringe to unjustly describe as a glorified bento box.  Salad to start, with a carrot-ginger dressing that makes you realize you have never had a real carrot-ginger dressing prior to the one made here. The red miso soup, followed by a choice of sushi or sashimi (very fresh, about 8 pieces), and a "box" consisting of: shrimp and veggie tempura, seaweed salad, mushroom salad, egg souffle dumpling, and a portion of broiled salmon.  The tempura was perfect. The seaweed salad, much like the dressing, opened my eyes to what seaweed salad should be.  Nothing ecto-green color to say the least! Skin on the salmon was crisped, and everything was gracefully put together. The finale was a fresh, sweet fruit platter of melon, strawberry, kiwi, pineapple, and orange.  How much, do you wonder?  $20 per person.  This was worth SO much more, considering the regular sashimi goes from $4-7 per piece!  Needless to say the modest presentation belied the incredible amount of food.Excellent service on both visits.sidenotes:- the female AND male bathrooms boast a ToTo toilet, happy day- by the time we left at 7:30pm on a Wednesday, there was a full line for a table- not wheelchair accessible
Dan D.}Lausanne, Switzerland}44}52}2}-1}5}4/1/2008}This is the most authentic, unpretentious, and delicious sushi bar I've been to [so far] since moving to New York (from Tokyo).  The service was excellent, the staff was attentive, and the sushi was absolutely delicious.  Relative to New York prices, this place is NOT overpriced.(Incidentally, it's sad to see how this kind of place is not appreciated by the New York yuppies, who prefer fancy decor to serious quality and traditional style.)Just to rant a little bit:  Yes, chirashi IS supposed to come in a bento box!  Yes, the miso is red miso, which is delicious, though clearly unfamiliar to the locals here.  And for all those who complained about the portion sizes, how much do you people need to eat!?!?
Jessica S.}Brooklyn, NY}5}139}2}-1}2}3/29/2008}A few years back this was my favorite sushi place in the E. Village. Used to be better, but now the food's overpriced, the service is brusque, and the portions have been mini-sized.And WTF is up with the weirdo chirashi? Chirashi is not supposed to be in a bento box.Pass on this one.
Can O.}New York, NY}5}11}0}-1}3}2/18/2008}I was reading Murakami on the way home on the subway. Of course I inspired eating some sushi. Hasaki was on my way between Astor and my place. Sushi was ok. Miso soup was the worst I had ever had, maybe not my taste. It is a restaurant that you can feel comfortable with your friends chatting all night. The sake list was pretty good. Nothing impressive but I would again and check the specials.
Ken C.}New York, NY}49}651}2}-1}2}12/18/2007}I just have dinner with my friends over there.  Everything is over price on the menu.  I know that the chef only talk in japanese, but ...Anyway the Negitoro is good, but uni is better.  The end.
Jeni Y.}Oakland, CA}106}244}15}-1}4}12/7/2007}Come here and sit at the bar if you're in the mood for authentic, quality omakase that is actually affordable! The rates run from $40/50 and up per person, which is quite a deal. My friend and I shared a Combination Omakase for Two, which was $120. The sushi chef gave us a huge variety of different kinds of sushi/sashimi, and helped us as we tried to figure out everything we're eating. It was fun watching him prepare our meal, and every slice we had was thick and tasty (the urchin literally melted in my mouth!)4 stars for quality omakase that doesn't burnt a $200+ hole in your pocket!
Jasmine T.}New York, NY}81}270}33}-1}5}11/21/2007}This is my new favorite Japanese place. A waste of time if you're just getting the usual maki rolls and salmon teriyaki. With a Japanese friend as a guide, we feasted on 5 seaweed salad, oshinko (pickled veggies), negi-toro plate(fatty tuna), gindara (Miso cod), ebodai bou sushi (butterfish), ankimo ankou teriyaki (monkfish liver), kanisu (crabmeat) and natto (fermented soybeans). We were full until the next day.
Jay L.}New York, NY}0}30}0}-1}5}11/6/2007}My favorite Japanese resturant in NYC.  Love the fish and the rolls.  The only downside is the waiting time - can be lengthy during Friday and Saturday nights.  Don't forget to check out the tea place next door for some fine desert!
David C.}Los Angeles, CA}11}82}0}-1}4}10/25/2007}This is my favorite sushi place in the city.  The fish is fresh and they keep it real.  Some things you should know.It is always cheaper to order the sushi 5 dinner, which gives you a taste of everything.They will not sit you unless you have your whole party there. They do not take reservations and there is a wait every fri & sat night -unless you get lucky.There is an outside, but I don't think it is that nice.The best thing to do if there is a long wait is to have them serve you a beer in the vestibule or go down the street to the sake bar (decibel) and get a drink.  I used to get just ok service, but the past two times I went I had good service....  What I love about this place is it is straight forward, I know I can go there and get a great meal - without hype, or some crazy fusion stuff.
Joan H.}New York, NY}191}480}0}-1}4}8/6/2007}I'm not sure what everyone is saying re: small portions. I got the sushi 5 and had more than enough to eat (my date ended up eating a good 4 pieces of mine or so) at a reasonable price (I believe it was $22) for very fresh and tasty fish. Tried the miso soup, which was definitely quite different from any I'd seen and tasty; had a glass of plum wine and shared a very very generous portion of green tea ice cream with aforementioned date (we didn't even finish it).  The ice cream was very very good, packed full of Japanese green tea flavor. My only pet peeve was that the server was unwilling to seat the pair of us at a table that serves four, even though there was nearly no one in that section, saying it was important to them to reserve that space for larger parties. I was insistent on sitting in the table set for four, and said I'd handle the consequences of squeezing another pair next to us should it happen. Well it didn't happen - so there! While the quality of food was very good, I think I really give this a 3.5; as the decor had little to add. I just wanted to give it 4 stars to balance out what others were saying about "tiny" portions. I simply disagree!Essentially - worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood and want some high quality sushi without any bells and whistles.
Lindsay K.}New York, NY}434}570}7}-1}3}7/1/2007}Delicious rolls, satisfying red miso soup, and a toilet in the bathroom that massages your ass cheeks. Hasaki, located on the basement floor of a cute little building near Astor Place, is a treasure. Unfortunately, the portions are tiny and prices are too steep to return. Looks like I will have to continue to find a good raw fish/ass massage haunt elsewhere in the city. Damn.
Pam S.}Brooklyn, NY}186}412}399}-1}3}6/26/2007}12 pieces of fish for $40, when we ordered the Omakase for lunch. Thank GOD I came with my parents because I'd feel so heartbroken for having to pay that much for 12 itty pieces of fish. I mean, they were delicious that's for sure.. but I'm not sure if I found them so tasty because they were ($40 + $12 tax&svc) / 12 pieces = $4.25 a bite. LITERALLY. The pieces were pretty small, so each piece was one bite each. Maybe I have a big yap, or maybe the cuts were just little. My dad enjoyed the curry soba, and my mom enjoyed her grilled dish. And by 'enjoyed' I mean they said "This is pretty good." - a mild rave, nothing special. I thought the beef negamaki was pretty good, but a little expensive for what you get.I'd give this place 4 stars for the quality of the food, while turning a blind eye to the small portions and the big prices. Worth a try if:1. you can expense it2. you have lots of rich friends who are small eatersNone of which are an option for me at this point. So, I probably wouldn't be going back. Unfortunately, it's an overall 3.
Lauren T.}Manhattan, NY}24}18}1}-1}3}5/12/2007}Not the best Japanese restaurant ... but it is solid.  The fish is always fresh (that melt-in-your-mouth fresh) and I love that the pieces are not too large.  Most Japanese restaurants tend to pieces that are too large to just pop into your mouth - resulting in a very clumsy meal.Unprentious, well-priced, fresh. Try it.
Okra S.}New York, NY}32}88}18}-1}4}4/21/2007}Hasaki is one of my favorite sushi restaurants.  The fish is really fresh, and  the rice is perfectly cooked...never hard or overly sweet.  the red miso soup is delish...my cousin ordered the teriyaki salmon, and i had my doubts because teriyaki sweetness usually turns me off, but this was the most delicate yum teriyaki salmon i've ever tasted. the sauce actually comes on the side in a little bowl, and it is a very liquidy subtle sweetness. Excellent quality sushi etc. for reasonable prices...definitely a great value...
KC L.}New York, NY}51}96}3}-1}3}4/11/2007}This place is a hit or miss for me...  When I've gone for lunch, it's good.  For dinner though, I'm always left dissatisfied with something...
Justin C.}Boston, MA}655}359}11}-1}5}1/8/2007}At $40 per person the Omokase at Hasaki was one of the best recent sashimi experiences I've had. They began with a nice, uncommon touch - a savory red miso soup. The chefs offered succulent & large lumps of melt-in-your-mouth toro, Aji (horse mackerel), a whole urchin shell tumbling over with luscious uni, kanpachi (a yummilicious fish kind of reminiscent of hamachi and red snapper), a pile of dainty sweet shrimp, and real wasabi!!! The place is a small & cozy little spot staffed entirely by lovely Japanese people, the service was attentive & courteous, it was a delight in every regard. I tend to be critical of these little E. Vill sushi joints as many of them are sub-par, this is not one of them. Go.
Stefanie S.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}4}12/9/2006}This used to be my absolute favorite place for sushi in the EV. They have solid, traditional sushi (no crazy rolls, just the standard stuff). Hasaki has gone downhill a bit as far as freshness, but it's still pretty consistent. I'm a big fan of the spicy tuna- it has fresh chunks of tuna with a little spicy mayo rather than the diced, almost paste-like spicy tuna at most places. I almost don't want to share, but the best time go to Hasaki is at lunch. They have good deals - try the flower garden platter (the only thing I still go here for) - a solid and inventive mix of sashimi, nigiri and maki. YUM now i'm hungry.If you like Hasaki I also recommend Ebisu on E. 9th and 1st Ave.
Nick D.}New York, NY}14}11}0}-1}4}10/14/2006}I'm surprised the other reviews are so mixed. Hasaki sushi not all that imaginative, but it's fresh, the wasabi melts in the soy sauce, and the uni, always a good barometer, is reliably fresh. And the dark sour miso -- from Osaka? -- is a welcome variation.
Angry D.}New York, NY}3}143}0}-1}2}9/27/2006}Wow I had the same shock when my chirashi came in a bento box.  The sushi/sashimi was good and the ceviche was really good  But they put so much wasabi in our natto roll that I felt they were hiding something.  The waitstaff were polite and handsome/pretty but it can't make up for the small portions, somewhat high prices, and the average fish.
alisa o.}San Francisco, CA}17}64}26}-1}2}9/8/2006}It used to be such a great place, but not any more. Authentic Japanese dishes were replaced with simplified fusion garbage. For example, if you ask for Chirashi, instead of a traditional round bowl with rice topped with fresh sashimi, you get a weirdly shaped obento box in which all of the ingredients are laid out separately in little mountains. What is this?! Staff was rude. All of our sushi rice was almost steaming hot. I do have to say that their fish was fresh. Nevertheless, I am never going back there again
Katie Q.}Philadelphia, PA}80}204}0}-1}3}6/27/2006}"Amazing sushi!  They have a miso soup unlike any I've ever had.  Dark miso with a smoky flavor- it has replaced chicken soup in my affections when I have a cold.  Their seaweed salad is like having a mermaid lovingly handpick a bouquet with 5 kinds of astoundingly fresh seaweed topped with a lovely understated but savory dressing.  The fish is always fresh and they don't use imitation anything.  I have a delicate palate for fish and I have never had a piece of sashimi there that I didn't love. ***as you can see i loved this place (formerly 5 stars) i am so bummed that i have to knock some wattage off of the starry glow that this place has had in my heart for so long but i cannot stand by and idley watch them cut their pieces into slivers of fish while jacking up the prices.  i have dined here a few times in the past couple of months hoping my tuna portions were a fluke (that was bad, i know) but alas it is the end of an era.  the fish is still wonderful and fresh but who cares if you leave with a growling stomach and grumbling under your breath.  AND they've even gone to the trouble of buying new miso soup bowls that are smaller than the ones they had for the past 9 years - so what, they can conserve on soup costs?  what's the mark up on soup these days?  how much could they possibly save?  maybe they thought nobody would notice- they should know their dedicated fans better.  i'm very disappointed and frankly a little sad....no i am not crying i have allergies okay?  leave me alone.  god."
Debbie K.}New York, NY}59}141}1}-1}4}5/15/2006}Solid new place (for me) for sushi in EV.  It's basement level, right next to that big NYU friendly complex that houses Angel Share.  Pros: Everything seems really fresh.  The king crab sushi was SO good.  The rolls were small, but also flavorful. Nice server.Cons: On the pricier side of sushi.  2 piece min order.  I think fish quality makes up for it.  Limited roll menu - had trouble thinking of other rolls I wanted to get.  Service was on the slow side, especially for easy things like drink orders.  Worth checking out if you're not cash strapped & super hungry.  People next to us seemed to have gotten the omakase which looked good.  Try the king crab sushi!
Frank K.}San Francisco, CA}19}70}1}-1}4}1/29/2006}Small non-descript sushi restuarant down some stairs, but boy dont let that fool you, some great sushi and good prices!

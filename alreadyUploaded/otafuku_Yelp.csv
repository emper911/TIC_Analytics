Juliana J.}Birmingham, AL}195}12}2}-1}5}5/1/2018}Amazing cheap Japanese food! I loved the taiyaki! Small menu but everything was really good. Noodles with shrimp is recommend.
Joy S.}New York, NY}26}85}200}18}3}4/24/2018}Had the mocha and red bean taiyaki and was disappointed it wasn't made fresh. They basically reheat already made taiyakis once you place the order and it takes up to 12 mins to get it.1 taiyaki is $3.50, but if you buy 4 you get 1 free. They accept card as well.
Christine C.}Cupertino, CA}140}4}1}-1}3}4/18/2018}I got the takoyaki and taiyaki combo set, and overall, the food was quite good for its price. However, beware that both are quite heavy on the dough/flour. In fact, in the takoyaki, there's a tiny piece of octopus in a giant ball of dough. However, the seasonings and toppings made it very enjoyable to eat. Though I'm unsure if I will return, I'm glad I tried it.
Andres V.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}18}20}-1}4}4/17/2018}The food here is super great and the place has a nice vibe to it with only a couple a seats inside and one bench right in front of the place. The menu has changed and their location isn't where it says on this app, it's actually right across. Menu is also different and it's a lot more expensive than the original menu pictures that others have posted on their reviews. So it's more pricy yet it seems to be the same proportions of food they gave before, but the food is very good. I had the yakisoba combo which came up to about $16 and change which is kinda expensive if you ask me. It's only 6 takoyaki's but it's a good amount of yakisoba. Even though prices are a bit high the food is very good and it's worth a try if you've never had any before. If you're lucky they might make more fresh takoyaki if they're out and you can see how it's made. Also the yakisoba is made right in front of you so you can take pictures it record the food being made.
Tommy T.}New York, NY}1}40}57}-1}4}4/16/2018}Definately not a one $ place. Hella pricey!! 6 takoyaki balls for like $7 jeez. That's without tax too. Okonomiyaki is 2 phat pieces for $11 so not cheapTakoyaki is pretty good tho ngl ofcourse not as good as at a street matsuri in Japan but pretty good for NYC. Expensive but good! Worth if u can afford
Karen H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}22}0}-1}3}4/7/2018}I first went to Otafuku when I was in high school...so 10 years ago. 0.0 Their takoyaki was definitely something I loved treating myself to after AP exams and even during college breaks. The takoyaki had generous pieces of octopi. The outside was cooked just enough to retain its shape but the inside was a hot gooey mess. :) I also loved their okonomiyaki. I have been there several times since I moved back to NYC...and the quality has gone down. Maybe I've had more bad batches than good ones.
Weich Y.}New York, NY}17}138}1657}-1}3}3/20/2018}Not the best okonomiyaki I've had :( the batter was undercooked and under flavored. I am almost sure that the mayo they use is not kewpie - it doesn't taste as good as kewpie and more like a regular kraft type mayo. Okonomi sauce is good.
Marie Angelie E.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}10}18}-1}4}3/14/2018}I used to come here a lot. The last time I came it was really packed. I ordered takoyaki (as usual), and I noticed they were slightly undercooked. The batter inside oozed out a little. I could tell it was rushed because it was pretty crowded.
Melody C.}Brooklyn, NY}12}82}155}18}4}3/13/2018}I came here twice before and, unfortunately, the first time was much better than the second time. When I went over the weekend, the place was packed with people. We got our takoyaki as soon as we paid, meaning it was probably not fresh. Was really hoping to see them make the takoyakis through that clear window lol. I like how big the takoyakis are at this place and the level of crispiness is just perfect. The octopus, on the other hand, was no bueno. Too hard to chew and did not blend well with the dough. Even so, I enjoyed it... just not as much as the first time. I'll definitely come back and hopefully to try the other items on the menu!
An T.}Bronx, NY}23}6}0}-1}4}3/11/2018}i made a 2 hr trip to get some takoyaki here when i was off work. there's no card minimum. i had the matcha taiyaki, banana nutella taiyaki and the takoyaki. not impressed with the taiyaki but the takoyaki was very good :~)
Michael N.}Brooklyn, NY}46}70}222}-1}5}3/4/2018}Omg the takoyaki balls are amazing!! They make it fresh compared to a lot of other restaurants!!
Tai H.}Tampa, FL}202}9}1}-1}5}2/7/2018}I went with a large group on a very windy and cold Saturday night, so the warmth of the hole-in-the-wall establishment felt very cozy. The shop was very packed with many other customers, and the place lacked a good line system for ordering. For it being so packed, I would have assumed that they would premake the takoyaki and just have it ready to be served, but to my surprise, when I ordered, I watched the entire process of my delicious steamy treats being produced: from the pouring of the batter, to the flipping into the tray. Maybe it was because I ordered with my juvenile Japanese, but I had the cream of the crop. I had ordered the premium takoyaki with sriracha, which although reached nearly $9.00, it was both aesthetically and gustatorily delectable. The rich layers of sauces as well as the mountain of katsuobushi (bonito flakes) made my order break the glass ceiling. Many of my other friends ordered the original takoyaki, and when we compared our orders, they were sorely regretful. They said their orders were soggy, and lacked any form of crunch. Maybe I was lucky that I got a good batch, or maybe the $2.00 extra really added to their meticulous nature in making my balls, but in the end, I was definitely satisfied. Definitely a cute and pleasing place to take a significant other.I will be back soon!
Jasmine C.}Brooklyn, NY}131}198}279}-1}4}1/23/2018}The place offers items by themselves or in a combo if you're indecisive and you know, wanna try basically everything on the menu (hehe, like me). They also offer a stamp card with specials on Tuesday (if you're a student) and Wednesday! Great if you're planning on coming back. We got the Combo B which consist of Takoyaki + Okonomiyaki for $12. The  takoyaki is $7.50 by itself and the okonomiyaki is $9.50 by itself. The okonomiyaki is basically a pancake w fresh veggies and your choice of protein - shrimp or pork. The wait time is a while for the food because they make it fresh every order. The okonomiyaki had a good portion of baby shrimps and it's soft on the inside. The takoyaki was great, they give a good big piece of octopus and it's a good soft chewy!
Jason C.}Manhattan, NY}425}612}581}18}2}1/23/2018}Food was premade and sat under a heating lamp.Taste is fine but food was cold and a little chewy. Employees kinda look like they didn't want to be there and dragged their feet with their slow service
Calvin S.}Winnipeg, Canada}74}1091}1251}18}4}1/19/2018}I remember back when this place was literally a hole in the wall. In one of my first NYC visits, I specifically made a stop here since I'm a huge fan of Takoyaki and I heard great things about this place. I enjoyed the food, but my experience was somewhat ruined since it was raining and there was nowhere to eat inside.When I found out Otafuku has an indoor seating area now, I was excited to have a proper experience here during my recent visit. I had the takoyaki...actually I had 4 since I was in a group of 7.The quality was definitely similar to my previous experience, minus getting soaked in the rain. However I did notice that they somewhat mass produce the takoyaki, so if you get a bad batch, the dough may be lukewarm compared to it being piping hot since it was already made.There are some other options you can get, but we stuck with takoyaki only. Perhaps they're just as good? Nonetheless, this review is strictly for takoyaki, and I overall liked it.
Anna H.}Jacksonville, FL}276}19}20}-1}4}1/13/2018}The most famous is the takoyaki, octopus balls, and it is pretty okay. The dough is too thick in my opinion, and only s small piece of octopus in each tako, which is very minimal compared to everywhere I've been before Aesthetic and location and good!
Kevin L.}Queens, Queens, NY}1}6}10}-1}5}1/12/2018}I've been coming here since they were in a small shack couple of stores down. This is my go to spot for legitimate takoyaki and taiyaki. I absolutely hate most ramen shop takoyaki because they're just a shitty imitation of the real deal. Keep in mind, I've been to South East Asia and Japan specifically. This is pretty damn close to the real deal. Finally got around to reviewing on yelp. Forget all the haters, this is the most beautiful onto ball you'll get in NY. Pro tip #3 - Get extra bonito flakes.
Yuki U.}New York, NY}0}43}0}-1}4}1/6/2018}I love their foods. Takoyaki and taiyaki taste really good!! I cannot stop going there although the foods are like snacks and they are not cheap. In addition to that, it's interesting to see how they cook them. Some parts process are different from ones in Japan.
Ivy C.}New York, NY}180}15}17}-1}3}12/30/2017}I have been dying to try some takoyaki and my boyfriend was so hyped to show me this place. It was my first time so I was definitely excited. We got a combo of takoyaki (octobus balls) and tayaki with red bean paste to share. The food looks really good and we took a lot of pictures of it, but the octopus balls were not as good as expected. I loved the sauce, bonito flakes, octopus in the middle and the parts of the dough that were cooked, however other parts of the takoyaki just tasted like uncooked dough. We actually googled to see if takoyaki was supposed to be like that! Apparently it's meant to be mushy? As for the tayaki with red bean paste, it was really sweet so I only took two bites of it. I'm definitely willing to try this place again, but next time I would definitely ask them to cook my takoyaki longer. The place itself only has a counter with 4 seats so it gets really crowded inside at times, but all in all, it's a cute little shop and I'm happy I finally got to try takoyaki!
Sheiny S.}Edmonton, Canada}148}11}9}-1}4}12/26/2017}Not a sit down restaurant! If you're in the area and looking for a quick snack though, check it out. Reasonably priced and quite fast. Takoyaki was excellent - really fun to watch them make it from scratch on site! Okonomiyaki was average, I've had better, and it took much longer to make then all of their other dishes.
Yvonne C.}Manhattan, NY}66}324}913}18}3}12/18/2017}This has been my go-to place for okonomiyaki and takoyaki for over 10 years, but I feel like it used to be better when it was a smaller, hole-in-the-wall stall.  In particular, I've been a fan of their okonomiyaki since not many places offer it, and those that do tend to have way too much batter.  The okonomiyaki at Otafuku is a true cabbage pancake and is filled with lots of goods and not filler batter.  It's cooked well -- slightly charred and crisp on the edges but still soft and moist.  However, this most recent visit, I felt like it was more wet than I remembered, and there was very little seasoning in the pancake itself and all the flavor was coming from the sauces on top.  Not sure if it was just a bad batch; I'll admit it's been a while since I've been here, so not sure if it was always like this and I just hyped it up in my head as one of my former favorites.I only tried the medetai once but was disappointed -- the waffle to red bean ratio was way too high (fish waffle was huge and not a lot of filling, and the waffle itself was pretty ordinary).
Cecille C.}Manhattan, NY}198}385}17}18}2}12/10/2017}What's wrong with this place? After it got upgraded from that tiny place to this small place nowadays, I felt like this place had gone downhill. Combo D (with stir fried soba and the Japanese pancake) used to be my favorite to order and I remember it cost me only $7-8 bucks. Nowadays, the same thing costs nearly $15. The worse thing was - my pancake was not well cooked, it has not even become solid before being served to me.
Shannon Z.}Brooklyn, NY}447}705}446}18}4}12/10/2017}This is the spot to get takoyaki (octopus battered ball). I've been a supporter of Otafuku since 2006 I believe when it was just a hole in the wall place a couple of stores down. They moved to the new spot just a couple of years ago but the quality is still the same. The price of Takoyaki is $7.50 which isn't too expensive for 6 balls but its not as cheap as it use to be. I remember the days where it was 6 balls for $5. Regardless, Otafuku has been a staple snacking place of mine. It fills you up when you don't want a full meal. I like the savoryness of the batter and then you get hit with that brown sauce topped with the bonito flakes and kewpie mayo. It's a party in your mouth all the time. Yummy eats.
Chaewon L.}Somerville, MA}0}17}49}-1}4}11/30/2017}Feel like this place is underestimated ! It's cheap, warm, and yummyThe service is really nice, and you also can choose between plenty of combination menus!I haven't tried out the other ones, but the takoyaki (octopus ball) was definitely goodHighly recommend if you are looking for some quick grab food and some high quality snacks
Ze W.}Lansing, MI}47}36}290}-1}4}11/29/2017}The food is made fresh and in front of you. The price is decent. The portion size is decent. Good food for a hangover. Place is very small. Only has 3 chairs inside and 2 benches outside. Overall good experience.
YiHsin C.}Flushing, NY}67}8}2}-1}4}11/26/2017}Smelled so good! The crisp waffle smell. Loved the matcha ice cream. I had taiyaki with red bean paste. Fresh cook on the spot though it took a while. I liked how the taiyaki didn't have the weird taste when there's too much baking soda added inside if you understand what I'm referring to. A lot of taiyaki I've tried had that weird taste when you add too much baking soda in the batter.Totally unrelated to food but the music they played was heavy metal....very interesting pick for this type of store
Michael L.}New York, NY}86}121}625}18}5}11/18/2017}A small hit up joint whenever you are in around st. Marks, right around the corner on e9th street is a japanese strip, filled with plenty of great eats. Tayaki here is fresh and great prices.
Alyssa G.}Massapequa, NY}23}16}10}-1}4}10/23/2017}Yummmm. First time I've had ookonomiyaki, so maybe I'm biased, but wow it was delicious. Good place to try new things. Only problem is it's very small and our order took a long time...maybe because it was popular and thus crowded. Super tasty though. Definitely going back to try more
Xin Y.}Manhattan, NY}7}24}32}-1}5}10/11/2017}Came a few days ago when it opened for 10 minutes and it was already packed and busy. I had just plain takoyaki (no combos) and hands down the best takoyaki I've ever tasted in NYC! They're really generous with the sauce and topping and its made on the spot and literally in front of you (it's an open kitchen up front). The insides were fluffy with a lot of octopus. Only con was that there wasn't a lot of seating or eating area and the place tends to get packed really quickly
Yanni C.}Brooklyn, NY}102}55}117}18}4}10/9/2017}Been frequenting Otafuku since they were a tiny hole in the wall further down the street and I was a piece of anime trash that just NEEDED to try those octopus batter balls that I saw in all my animes. BEST DECISION EVER because their takoyaki is delicious. I've had takoyaki from Japanese restaurants or as a snack from ViVi Bubble Tea and this place has the best takoyaki. It is their signature item after all. Their batter is delicious and they're cooked until they have a nice exterior. The inside isn't all mushy when you bite into it. They're always making new batches and you may or may not get a some fresh ones depending on when you get there. Sometimes they have them in a heating area with some taiyakis or medetais. Sometimes I miss the freshness of the takoyaki from when they were at their smaller location. There used to only be enough room for you to go in and order. This bigger location has room for you to sit by the bar or enjoy outside on the two benches. The okonomiyakis are also great when you know that just six pieces of takoyaki won't fill you up.
Andy Z.}Brooklyn, NY}92}18}1}-1}4}10/9/2017}My go-to place for takoyaki! Decently sized compared to other places I've tried,  plus tastes authentic.
Jainnielyn C.}Queens, NY}108}156}499}18}3}9/23/2017}This small 6-seater place sells Japanese snacks like yakisoba and takoyaki. I was craving takoyaki hard one day, so I went to check this place out. Biting into the takoyaki, my first thought was, "Where's the octopus?" It seemed like it was just flour and veggies, and not even a lot of veggies -.- The sauces and the fish flakes were tasty enough, but maybe other offerings are better.
Lilang N.}Manhattan, NY}219}58}235}-1}3}9/23/2017}Was extremely excited to try it for my first time!! But it came out decent. The onomiyaki was okay i did went for a seafood one. Also got the takiyaki but it wasn't good like vivi. If u want good takoyaki get it from vivi.
Jun Wei Z.}Manhattan, New York, NY}329}16}32}-1}5}9/3/2017}This is one of the best takoyaki I have in Manhattan. Their store is pretty small with affordable prices for their food. I got the combo 2 (takoyaki and okonomiyaki) it was filling for one person to finish. I been here a few times in the past they normally accpect credit card with a minimum.  However I came here few weeks ago and recently they are doing cash only. The line can be very long sometimes and have to wait a long time to order and pick up the food. Beside that I would definitely come back to this store to get their food again.
Katie L.}New York, NY}198}160}252}18}4}8/31/2017}Not the best, but I have an insatiable habit of seeking out octopus balls wherever I go! The first time I had Otafuku's takoyaki was the first time I'd ever tried this popular Japanese street food - so they will always be my first. I wasn't a fan of the mushy texture of the batter, and walked away more than a bit let down. Isn't that everyone's first though? Perhaps it was the cook that evening who may have taken them out too soon, but they would have benefited from another minute or so forming up in the groovy looking cylindrical cast-iron pan. I'm glad I decided to give them another try, because this time the flavors came together really well. The piece of chopped octopus provided a lovely textural bite in each takoyaki ball. And the various toppings, from Japanese mayo to the special takoyaki sauce, dusting of seaweed powder, and the withering bonito flakes when it touches the heat, sealed the deal. Their okonomiyaki is similar in taste, but includes cabbage and meats - essentially a large savory pancake with the same toppings as the octopus balls. I prefer the bite-size takoyaki as they tend to be less doughy, but a combo's the way to go since they're both worth a try. I'm looking forward to another pit stop when I'm down that way.
Zev L.}New York, NY}165}94}36}18}4}8/25/2017}I have a lot of bias in the okonomiyaki World simply because this place is across the street from my house. I have eaten here since their first location down the street and frequent as often as I can. The new place on 4th Street low gives it a huge run for its money as they are rambunctious and new and looking to impress. They have many greater variations of the okonomiyaki and takoyaki which make it a great competitor to this once King in the town
Adrian B.}Cos Cob, CT}38}243}42}-1}3}8/24/2017}Worth a visit if you are in the area and craving takoyaki. Not up to the standard of Japanese takoyaki vendors, if the takoyaki pieces were any smaller they would be invisible. Friendly service though.
Brittany T.}Manhattan, NY}1267}746}1391}18}2}8/21/2017}Came to get the medetai (fish waffle) and was sorely disappointed.WAIT: No waiting on a Saturday around 6pm, we were able to order right away.ATMOSPHERE: It's very small inside, a few stools, a counter and then a bench outside.  You can see them making the food behind the plastic.  Everything seems to be pre-packaged and the medetai was already pre-made by the time we got there so it's not piping hot or anything.FOOD: Got the medetai.  I was misled because in photos the green tea one (seasonal) comes with red bean and mochi but the regular one only comes with the fillings.  They have red bean or nutella/banana.  I opted for the nutella/banana one.There's a $15 minimum for credit card so I paid cash, I think one medetai cost about $4.  The size of it isn't huge but it's a good amount for 1 person.  The batter itself is pretty bland, flavorless and too soft/spongey.  Not crispy at all.  The inside was meh - it's basically chocolate with 1 or 2 bananas.  I guess I was expecting more.  For fish waffles, I'd rather go to the one in the K-town Galleria food court that has mochi in the waffle or go to Taiyaki for ice cream + the waffle.Overall, I wouldn't recommend.
Mely P.}New York, NY}93}38}65}-1}4}8/12/2017}I love this place! I usually get the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo. I prefer their takoyaki to their okonomiyaki though. I find that the oko is sometimes too thick and mushy but it still tastes good so whatever.I also had their taiyaki split with the green tea ice cream and it's pretty good as well! I like to put the ice cream on the taiyaki and eat it together with the cereal for crunch.
Jenny G.}Brooklyn, NY}56}340}1894}18}4}8/12/2017}Small snack run around the neighborhood. We went many times at other hours and it's always packed.  This time went at 5pm there was no line.  Quickly ordered the takoyaki.  It was very good. Its got one big piece of squid as filling and the texture was firm with just enough potato filling. Though wish it was crisper on the outside.   All sauce to the side  because we don't like to them drenched.  Definitely return back for more if I around and no line.
Ti V.}queens, NY}0}92}89}-1}4}8/7/2017}Medetai with nutella and bananas were very good. Pancake was soft and had good amount of filling in each bite.
Amanda T.}New York, NY}1}18}0}-1}3}8/3/2017}The Okonomiyaki is pretty good, but avoid the Takoyaki. I've had the takoyaki several times and this is not what it's supposed to be like. Every time it was severely undercooked, so that the inside was a slimy, runny, gooey, raw mess. Takoyaki is supposed to be cooked through, not barely cooked on the outside and then packed with raw batter on the inside. It was so bad the last time I was there I gave up and threw it away halfway through. I know they're busy and they're trying to keep the line moving, but not cooking them all the way through like they're supposed to is kind of a rip off. I'd rather wait 15-20 minutes for a fully cooked product than only wait 10 minutes and have something that's barely edible.
Sophie H.}Queens, NY}535}230}220}18}5}7/26/2017}I am a huge fan of this small takoyaki place, ive had octopus balls all over the city in ramen joints, saint marks japanese places, you name it...its always made fresh and the batter and filling are so delicious it keeps me coming back for more, although the batter seems thick at times, the filling always is generous with chewy octopus and the fresh bonito flakes and sauce on top makes it perfect.
D M.}Bogota, NJ}57}192}40}18}4}7/17/2017}I like this place.If you like okonomiyaki, you will too.It's not the best okonomiyaki or takoyaki I've ever had (especially the takoyaki) but it's GOOD. And it's charming and efficient. I might be back because it is conveniently located but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
Denisia C.}Brooklyn, NY}19}10}22}-1}5}7/8/2017}Really, really cheap yummy food! I remeber looking this place up last year b.c I always wanted to try that fish pastry, did not regret it. The food comes in sets, I took the one with the fish pastry and the takoyaki. I only went once so far but I plan to come again.
Wynne E.}New York, NY}2}21}7}-1}3}7/4/2017}Good Okoyomiyaki--tons of cabbage inside and plenary of bonito on top!  Could have been cooked a little longer as the pancake did not stay together.  I also got takoyaki, which as I have never had them before, I probably am not the best person to judge.  They were rather chewy and lacking in filling.  On the plus side, the dough did have scallions on the inside--I am not sure if that is normal but it was rather nice.  I might return if they cook their products more or if I happen to be in the area, but I would not make this a destination eatery.
Winston V.}New York, NY}320}36}0}-1}4}6/30/2017}Liked this place a lot. There isn't a lot of room to sit, but the takoyaki is really good. The service is fast, and the food is flavorful. Will return!
Quang N.}East Brunswick, NJ}12}11}8}-1}5}6/19/2017}I love this place. I always want to try this and finally I'm here.  Very good for snack time.
Rachel L.}Tenafly, NJ}401}172}1087}18}3}6/17/2017}6 Takoyaki balls for $7 is pricey. And the octopus is of a size of a fingernail. But it's a great location to go for a quick snack. But next time, I think I will chip in a few more dollars and go for a meal.
Toshie O.}Forest Hills, NY}0}59}5}-1}2}6/6/2017}I grew up, eating takoyaki as snack or meal sometimes. This takoyaki is totally different from the one I am familiar with. Too much flour was used. I won't go back.
Julie C.}Brooklyn, NY}731}52}92}18}4}6/5/2017}This is a small hole in the wall restaurant type where they name yummy takoyakis, okonomiyaki, yakisoba and medetai (the fish dessert) before your eyes. They also give you the option of 4 different combos where you can get two dishes and my favorite combo is combo c and it consists of takoyaki and yakisoba. Just that combo alone is enough to fill me up. If you happen to be looking for a light snack this is also a good place. Pros: Good and affordable food. They're also fast and the wait isn't too long if you get hangry easily like me, it's a good spot to hit up. Though they can get a little busy at times but the wait is very doable. Setting: It is a tiny place with a high counter table that stretches across their wall with a few high seats. Once the the seats are filled people stand and eat their meal. It can get crowed during busy times but people are always shuffling in and out.
Patrick Y.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}49}71}117}18}3}6/2/2017}I've had takoyaki at a few other places before and this place is just as good as the others. The food is relatively fast but the noodles are packaged, not fresh. Pretty good taste for a quick bite.
Haeri S.}Queens, New York, NY}63}147}1190}18}3}5/31/2017}I kinda grew up with takoyaki and okonomiyaki and their food is just alright for my taste. Takoyaki and okonomiyaki had a lot of flour and I wish they had more vegetables and other ingredients inside. Of course you can't beat their prices ($7 dollars for six big takoyaki, $9 dollars for okonomiyaki) but I would rather pay more and get better ones in other places. They make food after taking orders so it takes pretty long time. So if you are in rush, this is place is not recommended. They used to be better but they have been changed I think. I don't think I would come back here again.
Liz S.}New York, NY}636}530}1003}18}3}5/24/2017}Stopped in last night for dessert on my way home from work. This is a no-frills space and lacking in vibe, but still clean. The girl at the counter was sweet but couldn't really communicate. Card only accepted for $15+... so basically cash only.I got the nutella and banana medetai ($3, plus tax and tip). It was ready to go by the time I had finished paying! My fish pastry hot in my hands, I set out on the streets of East Village.My disappointment increased with the blocks I walked. The pastry itself tasted like a mediocre pancake. It was reasonably fluffy but had no real flavor. I had to really hunt for the filling. Pretty dry experience overall with the shell dominating and with only a couple of slices of banana and a very light amount of nutella. Almost all of the nutella was hiding in the tail, which was a sweet treat at the end.It's definitely a pretty pastry but it wasn't worth the stomach space for me. I'll perhaps be back for drunk eats to try out their savory dishes... but somehow I don't think their takoyaki will live up to my experience in Osaka.
Marina S.}Brooklyn, NY}341}318}780}18}3}5/23/2017}Aw man. Otafuku has been on my hit list for years, but a recent visit left a lot to be desired. I stopped by with only a few customers ahead of me, but the line moved at a snail's place. Once I was finally up, the cashier barely looked up from the register and took a while to even acknowledge me. No one working looked like they were happy to be there.I ordered a plain red bean taiyaki, and while I saw some being freshly prepared, I was given one that was lukewarm and must have been sitting for a while. It was tasty but dry, and definitely would have tasted better if I had gotten a fresh one.Sad. If I stop by again, it's definitely going to be for the takoyaki or okonomiyaki. Hopefully I'll have a better chance of getting a fresh meal then.
Kratistos L.}Colorado Springs, CO}69}7}0}-1}5}5/19/2017}Delicious meals! Everyday after creative writing class I would swing by Otafuku during the mid-evening.  At first I would eat takoyaki but then I discovered Yakisoba with Octopus and I was hooked!  Only drawback is that to pay with card you need to spend $15, at the same time the Yakisoba is so good that it's worth it!
Jamie H.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}58}20}97}-1}5}5/17/2017}Love love love the takoyaki and the pancake. I always get that combo when I'm craving it!!!
Sacha-Avi S.}New York, NY}235}117}106}18}3}5/16/2017}Tried the Nutella and banana medetai here. I was disappointed. While it's priced okay and the wait wasn't too bad, the texture of the batter was not for me. Very dry and kind of like corn meal. I expected a sort of lightness to it like at deli manjoo but it wasn't there. I think I'd avoid coming back if possible (just for medetai)
Danielle P.}New York, NY}192}34}8}-1}3}5/15/2017}I love Takoyaki so if I ever find myself in the area with a craving for a small bite, I usually come over here. The takoyaki is pretty great, not amazing but definitely better than average. You should definitely check out a combo dish - you could get takoyaki with a medetai (which is really a taiyaki - I guess the names of the two items were too similar?), okonomiyaki, or yakisoba. Skip the soba (Bland, forgettable), but the okonomiyaki is really good! I ordered it blindly without knowing what I was getting and was pleasantly surprised. Its basically a 'pancake' made out of cabbage, egg, and some other mix ins. Just try it, you'll be surprised. After a few times I decided I should try the medetai since I am obsessed with taiyaki. Unfortunately, they do not carry my favorite filling (custard cream), so I went for the red bean. The red bean filling from this location is actually pretty good, a bit sweetened but not too much. The batter itself was pretty bland. Overall I would probably not order again, which is a shame because I would love to find somewhere nearby that can get me a steady supply of tasty fish shaped treats.They also offer nutella and banana and a seasonal flavor which is always changing and available only in limited amounts. The medetai did take a really long time to cook, though - 20+ minutes. We waited for fresh takoyaki and by the time my medetai was done my friends had already finished eating. I know that they are better fresh and it does take a while, but I'm not sure why I wasn't told about this long wait while those behind me were told of the wait for the special flavor of the day. Overall I would return for the takoyaki when I'm in the area but I would skip the yakisoba and medetai (unless you've never gotten to experience it before and want to see for yourself).
Tammy N.}Staten Island, Staten Island, NY}50}155}149}18}4}5/12/2017}I shared the combo B, $11, with a friend and it consisted of 6 takoyaki pieces and okonomiyaki, we went with pork instead of shrimp. The takoyaki was delicious and very hot, so be careful and let it cool before you eat it. The okonomiyaki, on the other hand, was alright. It just tasted like saucy cabbage. But it was enough to fill the both of us up.
Millie S.}Manhattan, NY}356}210}249}18}3}5/10/2017}3.5 stars - food was ok, and also too heavy.The menu only has four items - takoyaki, yakisoba, okonomiyaki, and taiyaki - so if you come with a friend and both of you are hungry, you'll be able to try everything and get very filling meal for just $10 per person. If you plan on all four, the way to go is Combos A + D, which comes out to be around $22 between two people. Serious win on price!So, the food. The takoyaki was just the right chewiness and watching the bonito flakes dance on top was weirdly fascinating; it was also very filling in itself (a recurring theme). The shio shrimp yakisoba was like any other noodle dish and wasn't outstanding in any way, not to mention also crazy salty. That was my least favorite. I liked the okonomiyaki for flavor, though thought it could've done with much less sauce drizzled on top (it basically turns everything into a mush in your mouth...appetizing). That and the yakisoba were both very rich and fatty...you're going to feel super unhealthy by the time you walk out. Fortunately, the red bean taiyaki steered the other way and was light and sweet instead. It wasn't anything really special, just red bean paste between two fish-shaped waffles that you could make yourself at home with a taiyaki iron, but it was a welcome ending after such a greasy meal. There are some meals/foods that make you feel like a wanton glutton in the worst way possible, like how you might feel after a 3am drunken Halal-Guys-with-extra-white-sauce bender, and Otafuku kind of does that for me. I'm not a detox/green juice/etc kind of person but I felt like I had to go on a juice cleanse after eating here.But on the flip side, you really can't beat the value for price. That's the extra half star for me.
Tiffany P.}San Francisco, CA}0}4}2}-1}3}5/7/2017}Pretty underwhelming. I was craving takoyaki and thought I'd give this place a try. It satisfied my cravings, but their food is nothing special. The takoyaki was too soft and mushy for me. I waited 15+ minutes to get my food (I ordered two taiyakis as well), and the takoyaki wasn't fresh. They pulled it out of the heat lamp oven which had a huge batch of pre-made takoyaki. The taiyakis were okay, the read bean was also pretty bland but the Nutella+banana tasted good. It's fun to watch them make it though.
Jeannie C.}Manhattan, NY}29}36}179}-1}2}4/22/2017}Sad. It used to be so good. Handmade. Flavorful. The octopus balls used to be so fresh that it was too hot to eat immediately, but you wouldn't care. When you have food that good, you brace for the hotness and chow down. You just cannot wait. It used to be a shack that one would hardly take a look except for the crowd that built around it. Now... new location. New methods.  I wish I could say same great taste. But it's now. Now the octopus balls are machine made, rest under heat lamp. It's like they used to serve fresh burger and now they serve fast food. Tasteless. The only thing I could taste was sauce - was there even octopus? Not fresh - barely warm under heat lamp temp. Sad.
Adam C.}Shirley, NY}122}12}0}-1}4}4/20/2017}Had the Combo D which was a okonomiyaki and a yakisoba for $12.  Food was good - the pork okonomiyaki was great, really nice flavor and good size.  The yakisoba was pretty standard, no complaints but nothing to write home about.  I went on a weekday around 1pm and there were 2 customers inside, but for some reason it still took 15+ minutes to get my order out. Not sure what the deal is with that.
Roger H.}Jamaica, NY}429}199}695}18}3}4/20/2017}oh otafuku, you were my first, not my best but you hold sentiment due to being my first......for trying takoyaki balls that is! tried this place back in 2008 when it literally was a hole in the wall and the only seating they had was an outdoor bench which held only 3 people at best, back then i thought maybe takoyakis werent my thing since it was too mushy and the octopus too rubbery and chewy. fast foward nearly a decade later at a bigger location and im here again a seasoned takoyaki okonomiyaki veteran, and coming to the realization of "its not me its you". the outside of the takoyaki is soft and not crunchy, the inside filling is bland and mushy, not savory and creamy like it is supposed to be, the octopus is rubbery not soft and tender like its supposed to be......the okonomiyaki is pretty much stuffed with cabbage and bland to the point of eating an undressed salad. you get points for sentimental reasons for being my first expereience with takoyakis, and probabaly being one of the first establishments in nyc which served this item, but boy do you guys underwhelm......
Thuy-My L.}Manhattan, NY}162}54}2}-1}5}4/18/2017}YES! MY FAVORITE SNACK IN THE WORLD. TAKOYAKI. This was the first place I ever had it, and I have fallen in love. I love love love this place, and you won't find better takoyaki in many other places. Not meant to be a fancy place, but a little shop to get the most unpretentious quick and delicious snack there is to have.
Edward C.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}4/10/2017}I work in the neighborhood so I decided to try their Okonomiyaki during my 30 min. lunch break.  Big mistake!!!  Spent 20 minutes waiting for it and the store wasn't even crowded.  In the end, the Okonomiyaki was at best OK and hardly worth a 20 minute wait.  Guys, if it's going to take 20 minutes to fill an order, then that's the kind of thing you need to let people know.  After all, not all of your customers are tourist.  Also, the Latina girl who took my order had way too much attitude for someone who is basically just a cashier.
Christine S.}Queens, Queens, NY}18}1}0}-1}3}4/5/2017}I usually don't write reviews but I was pretty disappointed. This was my first time here and I was excited to try the food. The staff did not seem interested in my presence and continued doing maintenance tasks while I ordered and waited for my food. I ordered the combo of shrimp yakitori and shrimp okonomiyaki. The bummer: the shrimp was not cleaned! The poop vein was in every piece of shrimp which made my meal unappetizing. I don't know if I want to go back and try their other options because I want to be hopeful but not deveining the shrimp is a big no no in my book. Otherwise, the food was decent but not something I'd get often with their prices and outrageous card minimum.
Jasmine N.}Borough Park, Brooklyn, NY}107}1}0}-1}4}3/30/2017}Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the food here-- the combos are super filling (I have a huge appetite) and satisfying. Very flavorful and never bored of the food. The only bad thing is, probably the fact that they have very little options. :( But hey, don't let that stop you from trying what's on their menu. :) One of my favorite places in NYC.
Sara A.}Queens, NY}222}39}117}-1}5}3/23/2017}First time trying shrimp okonomiyaki and it was delicious! Portion was huge and for $9-not bad! They were kind enough to charge my phone in the back as I waited for my order which was out in no time. The place is tiny but that's the whole point people, street food!
Ellen H.}Worcester, MA}14}24}244}-1}4}3/19/2017}Cute little place! Almost missed the entrance. One of the best takoyaki I've had. Service was quick and easy. Great if you want to just pop in for a quick snack
Kevin C.}Brooklyn, NY}38}26}1}-1}5}3/13/2017}I always drive 1 hour from Brooklyn to get takoyaki here. Have never let me down ;)
Cee C.}Boston, MA}3}20}27}-1}2}3/9/2017}In theory I would love this place, because taiyaki and takoyaki are legitimately two of my favorite foods ever. But the quality here is very... meh. The last time I got takoyaki, it was soggy and bland. I've had better taiyaki from the frozen food aisle at Mitsuwa. I'm not actually convinced that their recipe for either batter is even correct.
Zhi L.}Sunset Park, NY}21}9}1}-1}5}3/1/2017}Found out this place through an youtube video. I decided to come here and try out their takoyaki during my lunch. I had takoyaki before and they are from the Vivi Bubble Tea. Vivi's takoyaki was the best until I came to Otafuku. When I tried one, I was surprised of the size of the octopus. Compare to Vivi, you can actually feel the octopus. Vivi's octopus size is so small that you questions if there are octopus in it at all. I was very satisfy and will definitely come back again.
Nari L.}Providence, RI}330}43}90}-1}5}2/21/2017}The takoyaki here is seriously to die for. I recall having some on the street in Tokyo and honestly being severely disappointed, but this place surprisingly made up for that experience! The shrimp okinomiyaki was also quite delicious. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be made, but there is no seating so be prepared to stand for a bit. If there aren't too many people, you could watch them make the takoyaki (its mesmerizing~). For my mom, my sister and me, one order of the okonomiyaki (2 "pancakes") and one order of the takoyaki (6 balls) was quite sufficient for a light lunch!
Charissa L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}3}-1}4}2/17/2017}Otafuku fulfills all my takoyaki cravings: they're simple octoballs with great texture and flavor.  I tried the special matcha medetai, a taiyaki with matcha, red bean, and mochi inside, and it made a great after-lunch snack.  The red bean taiyaki is tasty too, and they're all made-to-order, so you have to wait a bit, but it's sure worth it.  It's a small shop, so it gets crowded quickly and there's really only one bench to eat at.  Price point is reasonable, and their combo menu makes it even more enticing to order more.
Kevin C.}Queens, NY}204}121}1262}18}3}2/17/2017}Came here for an after-dinner snack. To be honest, it's pretty mediocre and you're better off spending your money elsewhere. I got the 6-piece takoyaki and the special matcha-taiyaki. The takoyaki is $7 for 6, but the matcha taiyaki was $5 for only one piece.Just looking at the takoyaki, you can already tell it looks a little off, especially when compared to takoyaki from other places and Japan. They also make a bunch ahead of time and keep them warm so they're not necessarily fresh. These takoyakis are actually gigantic, much larger than normal, but the taste wasn't great. Because it was so big, the batter inside is a bit gooey-er than most. The sauces and fish flakes are standard, but the balls fell a little flat.I also tried the special matcha taiyaki. It took 10-15 minutes to prepare fresh. However, it was definitely not worth $5. The taiyaki was very thin, and the matcha taste is lost because of the mochi and red bean filling.I'll come again to try the yakisoba, but I will not be getting the takoyaki or the taiyaki again. For the price I paid, I really can't justify spending so much for mediocre food.Also be warned I watched them make the okonomiyaki it's literally just cabbage LOL
Michelle L.}Orlando, FL}304}130}309}18}4}2/12/2017}We stopped by for the okonomiyaki. It was a very large portion! Definitely enough for two people to share. I felt like they went a little heavy with the sauce, but it was delicious. I would love to stop by to try more of their items next time.
Cindy W.}San Francisco, CA}566}608}391}18}4}2/2/2017}I really like this place! Good japanese street food - okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and medetai at reasonable price point. The portion sizes are also rather large. I really loved the takoyaki - great texture, flavor, and the sauce + bonito flakes = A+. Would make great drunk food I'd imagine. Okonomiyaki was a little too creamy for my taste. Medetai was a good end to the meal. It's standing room only (a bit of a problem bc it makes it hard to eat with friends or eat standing up at all). However, there's something about the energy of this place + location in LES that I just really love. It screams New York LES to me. A lot of students do come here and it can get pretty packed. Warning: line moves glacially slow...
Jamie N.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}168}134}437}18}3}1/31/2017}First time trying takoyaki. I'm not a fan and thought it was alright. Very small shop, had to eat outside.
John W.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}0}31}0}-1}5}1/26/2017}Thank you for always providing me with a quick delicious tokayaki treat (sorry if I misspelled that). What is there not to love about this place? It's fast, convenient, and tasty. The balls come out super crispy and fresh every time.
Khadija B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}1/24/2017}I went to this place because my friend was craving Japanese food, I ordered shrimp yakisoba, we waited for more than 15 minutes, when the food came it was flavorless so I asked for some spicy sauce, but the lady behind the counter said that I have to pay extra 50cents to have some sriracha sauce , I have never ever seen someone ask for extra money for spicy sauce, of course I didn't pay not because it was expensive but it was wrong! This place is not recommended at all, food is ok at best and service sucks
Allison Y.}New York, NY}224}89}916}18}3}1/23/2017}Octoballs anyone? After eating 6 octoballs, the thirst is real and so was the hunger...It was a little after 8pm on Thursday, all the restaurants in St Mark were pretty crowded so I opted for some takoyaki at Otafuki. I don't know if it was because it was late but the takoyaki were premade and placed under a heating lamp (damn, they used to make it fresh in front of you).I ordered a combo of Takoyaki and Shrimp Okonomiyaki for $10.50 which took about 30 mins. Regrets, much regrets. I wanted to try something new so I ordered the combo with okonomiyaki, I guess I should had read what that was... but.. it was just.. cabbage.. CABBAGE. The only flavor from Okonomiyaki I was able to taste was just the mayonnaise and takoyaki sauce... wasn't any thing special. The octoballs were covered with katsuobushi.. like.. COVERED... bush, anyone?There is only a bench in front of Otafuku, otherwise you can stand and eat inside but I would not recommend it as the space inside is pretty narrow.Don't think I'll be back anymore ):062316
Jephany Z.}Brooklyn, NY}46}29}6}-1}3}1/18/2017}I came here with my boyfriend and it was a nice atmosphere once you enter.  It's spacious,  however lacking seating (3 stools when more could be added).  We shared a combo B,  and it was decent food.  The wait was a bit longer that the others bc of the onomiyaki, which is fine.  For my personal preference it was a bit bland but my boyfriend thought it was fine.  The Takoyaki was not one of my  favorite ones (from the ones I've tried).  It was a bit soggy (like it's been made and it sat out for a while).  So I didn't really enjoy it as I normally would. We also tried the tayaki.  It was made on the spot which I liked but it was kind of doughy for my personal preference, but not bad . The workers were polite,  which is good for me.  I would come back to try the other things on the menu whenever I'm in the area.
Chung H.}Santa Monica, CA}12}107}216}18}3}1/18/2017}Takoyaki is pretty good.Its a small shop with maybe 6 max persons of counter space to eat.The nutella banana taiyaki was largely disappointing. Not enough filling of banana or nutella and the dough for the taiyaki didn't hold it's own so it was pretty tasteless.
Ziqi W.}Brooklyn, NY}132}36}59}-1}2}1/15/2017}I tried the Takoyaki but it wasn't that great. It was not only soggy but didn't really taste like real Takoyaki. I saw how they made it, and it's not really via the original way, the formula is pre-made, so not sure if it's actually fresh. Oh wells.
Mandy L.}Manhattan, NY}409}392}71}18}4}1/12/2017}Omg the takoyaki is so goodddddddddPros:- Takoyaki is delicious! Honestly I can come here and just eat this everyday - Combo platters - deals are pretty good Cons:- The okonomiyaki took around 15 minutes to make - a long wait for fast food - Minimum of $13 to use card - The matcha red bean with mochi taiyaki was okay - the red bean was present only in the middle of the fish with mochi at its end so oddly spaced; mochi was also unsweetened
David C.}New York, NY}270}39}0}-1}5}1/9/2017}So delicious. Like you are in Japan again. It has such good food that is hard to come by in even New York for such cheap prices. Yes!
Simone S.}Tarrytown, NY}109}32}172}-1}4}1/9/2017}I couldn't believe it when my SO told me that he found a takoyaki place in the city. We were both a little hesitant to try it because we didn't want to be disappointed since the last time we had takoyaki was in Japan. However, we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised!The place itself is tiny and is take out only. There are no seats, only one wall with a little ledge where you can eat if you please. You can also watch as they make the food because there is just a glass window between you and the kitchen.We decided to just try the takoyaki today, although the yaki soba looked really good too. I believe it came with six pieces and was in a little plastic container. We decided to eat it there since it was empty and boy were they good! My SO remarked at how similar they were to the ones that we had gotten in Japan and that he definitely wanted to return for more later. We will be coming back for more in the future!
Edlynn L.}Woodbridge Township, NJ}5}15}21}-1}5}1/9/2017}I love this place.  This is one place we never miss when we go to the City.  It's a pretty small place and can get really crowded.  We always get the Takoyaki.  Highly recommended.
Kathleen S.}Brooklyn, NY}54}210}350}18}1}1/8/2017}I ordered the January special of the medetai matcha. I had gone early right as the place opened at noon, since there are only 25 of the medetai matcha available each day. Boy, was I disappointed. The baked fish was made to order and took about 12 minutes, but it was hardly worth the wait. The matcha was a dull flavor, as was everything else inside. Simply blah and bland. Inside the two exteriors of the fish were two glutinous rice balls and some red bean. The rice balls tasted like nothing (just extra carbs) and the red bean, while sweet as they should be, was too thin a portion when the rest of the pastry really needed the kick. The $5 was overpriced given the sad results. Their menu seems to have been simplified, since I didn't see the parfait that are in some of the Yelp photos. Not returning ever again.
Lily C.}Brooklyn, NY}1}35}0}-1}3}1/2/2017}I tried the okonomiyaki from here and I was honestly disappointed. It tasted soggy, lacking flavor, and the whole thing was just slathered in sauce. The price (9 dollars) wasn't too bad for  the okonomiyaki as it was a generous amount and I was able to share it with my friend. Both of us love Japanese food and snacks, but for some reason, we just couldn't finish it as we got sick of the food from eating just a couple of bites.If I was really craving some yakisoba or takoyaki in the future, maybe I'll come back and try it out. However, so far, I don't really feel the urge to go back and try out the rest of their menu. If anything, I'll pay a few more dollars and head on over to a udon restaurant nearby instead.
Wendy H.}Brooklyn, NY}6}7}39}-1}3}1/2/2017}Tried the green tea medetai as it was the January special and what better thing to do on the second day of January lol.Maybe it was just me but I was expecting a creamy green tea custard with red beans and mochi and not just the outside being made of green tea. Didn't try anything else on the menu but I probably won't be coming back.
Suki W.}New York, NY}107}149}916}18}3}12/26/2016}I love coming here. I always come here for Takoyaki and sometimes the Okonomiyaki. Psst, especially when you're around drinking and you want some drunkchies, yess. But the only thing that I dislike is the fact that the Takoyaki is sometimes just slightly warm. I understand staffs keep it in a warmer to keep it warm so it speeds up the process when there is a rush. However, it looses its warmth and it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I usually see them put at least 6 sets behind the counter to keep it warm, and whenever I order, they just take one from there. And it's usually just warm or slightly warm.
Véronique T.}Versailles, France}2}163}167}-1}4}12/26/2016}The octopus was good, but the takoyaki itself wasn't hot and crispy like it should be. Overall, it was okay and I'm giving it 4 stars as I'm not sure there's another place serving takoyaki. Will try again and see if it's better.
Won Ho R.}Parsippany, NJ}53}11}3}-1}3}12/25/2016}If you want to taste fresh made Takoyaki and Yakisoba, this place will be your spot. I haven't found any restaurants in Tri-State that serves a fresh made Takoyaki. But I wasn't too impressed by their food. Takoyaki is good, but Yakisoba can be certainly better. It is bit too mild for my taste and they use instant ramen noodles. Given that they have a full set of grill, they can do much better than that. Regardless, good place to visit if you are wondering about NYC looking for a snack to bite on.
Nuri H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}13}8}-1}1}12/23/2016}So slow... i feel like i came for patience challenge game.. taste is good but overpriced!
Katsu D.}Manhattan, NY}13}153}7}-1}5}12/21/2016}This is literally the best Taiyaki and Takoyaki I've had since coming back from Japan. You will not find it this good unless you jump on a plane and get it in Japan. Not sure why people are complaining, I don't mind waiting a small amount of time for good food, it tasted pretty fresh to me. Only thing I wish they had some kind of stools or chairs inside. On a cold day when you're tired and hungry it would be nice to sit down and eat the hot food there.
Alex C.}Closter, NJ}234}43}157}-1}4}12/7/2016}Otafuku is a convenient, small little on the go restaurant that is highly recommended for quick bites. The actual restaurant is small and there are no seats for anyone to sit down. However, there is a table where you can stand to eat the food that is quite perfect. It fits around 3-4 people. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. There are different combos that range from 9-11$ of takayuki with a red bean baked good, okonomiyaki (shrimp or pork), yakisoba, etc. The combo usually comes with 2 items. Ive had the combo once and it is a decent amount for a quick meal. Usually, I order the takoyaki, which is the main attraction, and there are octopus balls smothered in flakes as well as a creamy mayonnaise sauce. Sometimes, restaurants overdo the sauce but I feel that Otafuku puts on just the right amount. For someone who is in a rush and needs a snack, Otafuku is definitely the place to go. It is one of my regular spots and you would be missing out if you dont miss this great catch near St. Marks.
C W.}Boston, MA}0}9}3}-1}1}11/28/2016}Super slow. Lack of management. Food is not tasty. I ordered takoyaki, yakisoba, Okonomiyaki, and medetai to eat in. When the takoyaki was ready, the staff did not give it to me. Instead, he put the takoyaki aside. Why? Because the other three things I ordered was not ready yet therefore the staff had to hold off my fresh takoyaki. After 20 mins, all the food I ordered was ready and he gave me everything once. However, the takoyaki was not crunchy anymore. Isn't it the silliest thing ever that customer cannot eat the food even you know is ready? Why can't he gave me whatever ready first? Also DON'T order green tea latte, it was just a powder mix and the cashier just mixed it in front of you without any recipe.
Cindy C.}Brooklyn, NY}1}11}0}-1}1}11/26/2016}BEWARE! I've noticed that the quality of this place has gone down but today's experience was a new low. They used to make fresh takoyaki for customers but now they will automatically give you the pre-made ones in the heating box unless you ask for a fresh order (AREN'T THEY SUPPOSED TO BE FRESH MADE TO BEGIN WITH?!). Do not come here thinking that the quality will be similar to those in Japan. Today, my boyfriend and I came in and asked for a fresh order of takoyaki - which they agreed given that it would take ~15 minutes to make. That was fine. However, I noticed that the male staff was letting the takoyaki cook while simultaneously cleaning the lower cabinets 2 feet behind the grill. Keep in mind he was using the same pair of gloves while handling cleaning agents and our food at the same time. I didn't say anything at first and I hoped that the staff would know to change his gloves after handling cleaning products - but NOPE. The male staff kept those same pair of gloves on to handle raw meat, and then proceeded to place our takoyaki in the serving plates. His thumb was actually touching a few of the takoyaki balls. At this point I was disgusted. How could you be cleaning while cooking, and on top of that handle raw meat and serve food with the same pair of latex gloves?!Why bother having an open glass kitchen if your shop is going to display such unsightly behavior? This place should get an F rating for sanitary audits. For people who have sensitive stomachs, you should steer clear of this place because given today's experience - you WILL get sick.After my boyfriend pointed out the staff behavior to the manager on shift, the manager offered us a refund. However we just asked to get another order that was handled with clean gloves, the manager agreed to our request. The manager asked the male staff to change his gloves but he did not comply, and was instead angry that he was asked to do such a thing. This resulted in another female staff having to prepare our takoyaki order. The guy never did change his gloves and he was handling more food orders after ours. This place is worthy of being sued if anyone has gotten an upset stomach after eating here. BEWARE!!
Teddy L.}Brooklyn, NY}210}11}2}-1}1}11/26/2016}This used to be a spot where I loved satisfying my evening crave for takoyaki. I even came here with my girlfriend two years ago welcomed by the crunchy textures and flavors that matched the one we had in Japan. However the quality has been going down for a while. They stopped serving fresh takoyaki and medetai unless you ask for it. If not it'll be the ones that have been kept warm under a light bulb. But today I witnessed a worker "triple cross-contaminate" the takoyaki. First of all, he was touching cleaning products which he was using for cleaning while cooking takoyaki at the same time. Then, he touched raw pork and handled the food he served to us with the same gloves, PLUS with his thumb touching our food. I don't know which is worse - cleaning products in the raw meat or having both essences of cleaning product and raw meat in our food. Note: he was wearing gloves but what's the point if your gloves look like you've worn them the whole day?? Are you too low budget to change out a pair of gloves while serving food?! On top of that use the same pair of gloves to handle cleaning agents AND food??I wish the owner of this business would see this review because it's not the store that I remembered it to be. The staff you have now is rude and gave us threatening looks when we pointed out what they were doing wrong, the male staff even yelled at his manager because he felt entitled to keep his glove on. I understand that this is probably common in food service to not be as strict with your own cleanliness, but if you were to do that don't open a shop with a glass open kitchen where we can see you clean, cook and prepare at the same time while not changing a $0.10 latex glove in-between.You used to be better but I don't think I will be returning anytime soon. For the Yelpers who want a good experience eating Japanese comfort food, look elsewhere. This place at this date and time does not properly represent the culture or customs that comes with what they are serving. This is not Japanese food nor is it Japanese service.
Elaine C.}Scotch Plains, NJ}16}73}776}18}3}11/21/2016}Ordered the takoyaki to go. A bit disappointed with the flavor, texture and consistency of the batter. Is takoyaki supposed to be liquidy mushy, bland, and soft on the outside? Best part was the bonito flakes and there just wasn't enough! Taiyaki was alright.Maybe they were good when they first opened and the hype messed with quality production. Maybe a bad day? Who knows. I'll try coming back one more time to give the takoyaki another chance and try their okonomiyaki. For now 3.25 stars rounded down to a 3.
Ryan R.}Omaha, NE}19}135}62}18}5}11/20/2016}Takayaki was excellent.. and with the medetai combo perfect appetizer size portion for 2 people. Get the Nutella + banana =
Sze Man C.}Waikiki, Honolulu, HI}1}1}1}-1}1}11/19/2016}This is my first review on yelp. It was the worst experience in my life. I really feel sad for the owner . He hired a really bad manager. This place has a really BAD Services. It might be a little too long but Please Read !!     Me and my friend ordered . We paid and took our change back. We did't know it came with the number ticket . The manager was "Ai ai."yelling at us to get the ticket. Me and friend was already like "Really haha we thought Japanese mostly are really polite." The food came. The Takoyaki was just warm. Me and my friend decided to tell them. *PS  it wasn't in a rush hour and only two of us were there. Then the manager went out and told us " Next time when you order please let us know you want them to be fresh one,otherwise we give you the one in the heating box " I said "this is my first time here. I don't know that." She said "it's ok , JUST DO THAT NEXT TIME!" But it's not make any sense, of course people go there for their fresh Takoyaki. Then she gave me a new fresh one . It was fine . I didn't argue with her. The Takoyaki was just ok . It was a little bit undercooked inside, but we still finished it. I decided to order a To go for my BF. Then I did what she told me to do. "Can I have a combo A with a FRESH Takoyaki, please!"  And the guy who work at there just being really rude and said all our thing are fresh. And the manager came back again and asked "Do you ok with one in the heating box right ?! You are doing TO GO anyways ." the way that she said that make me really disappointed. So if I'm doing TO GO, I can't have the fresh and hot order?!  That's really ridiculous.And at that time the guy stuff was giggling. It was really not respectful. I knew I was in a bad temper . I throw the money on the table . Then I got my food . The guy was really rude to me and said "Don't do this to my manager otherwise I'm going throw the food to you." I was shocked and don't know what to do and then I took the food away . Is that how you do that to your customer?! I knew You really want to impress your manager. On the way back home I just throw away the TO GO food. The way that how they treat me . I don't want to take a risk to eat their TO GO food . They might did something in there.
Amy Y.}San Francisco, CA}2}17}3}-1}2}11/19/2016}I had high hopes after walking past one day. But the staff had such an unwelcoming attitude when we ordered. Then they served us takoyaki that had been sitting in a warmer. It was barely warm. We took it back to the server and she said rudely that we have to request for the takoyaki to be made fresh. Wtf. You're a takoyaki shop!!! My friend wanted to order more food for her bf and the woman was rude once again for no reason. I've never see such rude Japanese people. I'm wondering even if they are Japanese...the takoyaki was just ok. Nothing special.
Jennifer Y.}Flushing, NY}33}26}7}-1}5}11/19/2016}After visiting this place for the first time in high school, about 8 years ago they have really up graded. Recently I have been back after 3 years and I can say I am still in love with their takoyaki. Absolutely deliecious!!! The next time I go back I want their combos, takoyaki and okonomiyaki. This will still be my favorite spot for takoyaki.
Suyon E.}Briarcliff Manor, NY}86}18}15}-1}3}11/18/2016}I used to come here all the time for takoyaki and okonomiyaki before they relocated because Otafuku was the best place i could find in nyc. But after it became popular, the original flavor was lost and the prices has gone up.
Jay H.}New York, NY}46}162}40}18}1}11/4/2016}The old place was so much better . Now they have new machines and Mexicans running the place the food doesn't taste the same anymore . Everything is quicker in terms of cooking and service but the quality of food when down and the actual cook of the food isn't the same. It use to be made by the owner and Japanese people behind a little counter with a manual takoyaki machines which makes it more authentic and give the quality of the takoyaki the crunch and taste. Now it's soggi, not cooked well since it's a machine and just follows a automated process. Sigh I wish it was the same old place again.
Jee In C.}New York, NY}0}29}11}-1}2}11/2/2016}Had the Medetai with red bean. Had better. Not warm with blend flavor. Not worth the $3.
Luke O.}Ithaca, NY}1}13}2}-1}4}11/1/2016}Otafuku is the one place in Manhattan where I can satisfy my cravings for takoyaki.While it may not live up to Japanese street food standards, the takoyaki and okonomiyaki are both warm, savory, and delicious. My only gripe would be that the food is on the pricier side, but that has never really stopped me from seeking Otafuku out.
Anne L.}New York, NY}64}139}139}-1}5}10/31/2016}This is the only place I can get Okonomiyaki that I like without having to eat in a restaurant. Takoyaki is good as well. I usually come here when I have time. I will more likely go again.
Geoff B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}4}0}-1}3}10/30/2016}The food is good, but the people working here have a crummy attitude compared to when it was closer to 2nd avenue.    Have mixed feelings about it now.
Lena G.}Manhattan, NY}74}7}2}-1}3}10/23/2016}After spending time in Japan and coming back to the US, I was pretty much resigned to saying goodbye to the amazing street foods I had tried there... until I discovered Otafuku.I instantly dropped in once I saw a sign advertising medetai (also known as taiyaki in Japan)- scrumptious fish-shaped pancakes with various fillings. It was one of my favorite festival snacks and I simply could not pass it up. I ordered a red bean one and a custard one. They were good, maybe not great, but they definitely hit the spot and calmed the nostalgia for a bit.For fans and first-timers alike, I recommend Otafuku for anyone looking for Japanese street foods that are difficult to find elsewhere.
Angeline C.}Brooklyn, NY}60}578}231}18}2}10/22/2016}I'm pretty disappointed in this place.  I had high hopes and I came here mostly because I longed for the okonomiyaki and takoyaki flavors I had in Japan.  When you walk in, you order and you can see the workers making your food.  Note that when I was there, all of the workers were not Japanese.  This doesn't really mean anything per se, but it made a world of difference in the taste of my food.  I'm really trying not to be judgmental here, but I think due to the fact that the workers were not Japanese, it could have been a reason as to why my food was tasteless.  The simple reason being, they probably didn't grow up eating this type of food, haven't been to Japan and are not familiar as to how okonomiyaki and takoyaki is supposed to taste.  My okonomiyaki looked delicious, but when you bit into it, it was extremely bland.  It's like they forgot something, I just don't know what.  My takoyaki balls were also tasteless and flavorless.  I think this could be due to the fact that the workers weren't making the foods correctly.  I don't fault them for not knowing though since this is probably just a job to them and were taught the basics.  Just don't come here expecting what you're used to and definitely don't compare this to the okonomiyaki and takoyaki you can get elsewhere.  The flavors you are experiencing here is no where close to how it's supposed to taste like.
Yumi K.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}1}-1}1}10/19/2016}This place is completely overpriced and is taking advantage of the fact that there are very few takoyaki shops in NYC. They use too much flour and the taste is not authentic. $8.99 for six takoyaki is pretty steep.  Worst of all, the staff acts like they are doing you a favor. I waited over 20 minutes for a okonomiyaki pancake and when the (short) girl messed up putting it into the take out container and it turned into a heap. I made a comment and she went off on me and said it was because I rushed her even though I had not said one word to her!  She told me to F*** Off! Nice!
Cynthia L.}Manhattan, NY}192}746}1300}-1}3}10/15/2016}The food was alright and nothing to rave about. For street food, this place takes a long time to process your order and finish it before handing you the expensive treats. There are combo sets here and if you're indecisive like I am but have quite the foodie palette for taste, then I suggest you pick a combo set and order select side items you might want to try. I ordered combo B for $11 and that consisted of takoyaki (fried octopus balls with dough). There's a problem with this one because I have yet to find a place that serves takoyaki with more than 5% octopus filling. I don't like how places like this don't give you your money's worth; it was upsetting since 95% of what I tasted was dough. There were 6 balls of these and the combo set also came with a "pancake" of fried cabbage and your choice of pork or shrimp. I opted for the shrimp and it was less than mediocre. I asked myself why I paid $11 for a combo as such and maybe considered selling fried cabbage with minces of shrimp by the city skylines and charging wealthy people a few fingers for it. ;) I also tried the fish cake with Nutella and banana filling. I liked this more than the cabbage and shrimp. The cake was moist and the fillings were good !
Se C.}Annandale, VA}209}365}569}18}4}10/4/2016}I always visit this spot for takoyaki and okonomiyaki when I visit NYC. This is a small store located in East Village. You can watch them make the takoyaki. They also have seasonal items. You can save up punches for a free combo or takoyaki. It is so pleasing to watch them prep the ingredients and make the takoyaki in front of you. The staff welcomes you warmly and are friendly. Check it out if you are in the area!
Jess N.}Bethesda, MD}0}9}1}-1}5}9/22/2016}Consistently some of the best tasting takoyakis I've had (in their price range in the city). I can eat takoyakis everyday allll day, and always stop by this place when visiting ny. Sometimes I wish their pieces would have more octopus filling, maybe it's my imagination but in the past they felt more satisfying. Still great!
Prima Z.}New York, NY}0}503}2}-1}3}9/18/2016}Got set A. A bit disappointed it took so long to cook. There was only 1 person before us and plenty of staff who seemed to be chit chatting more than cooking. I can understand that they want to make the food fresh but it seemed silly only seeing two medetai being cooked at once. The red bean was perfectly sweet. The takoyaki was delicious though much too large to fit in one bite. Overall good for a quick snack. $13 credit card minimum.
Wendy C.}New York, NY}175}389}354}18}5}9/17/2016}I love their takoyaki and okonomiyaki! The medetai red bean fish is alright, unless you like red bean. I think their combos are a good deal.
Rich W.}Queens, NY}836}999}4264}18}4}9/16/2016}Otafuku moved from their little tiny store that only can fix three people standing to a new expanded store just down the same block!They serve one of the best takoyaki, okonomiyaki and yakisoba in NYC.You can watch them make the takoyaki on their special cooking trap that shots air from the bottom to rotate the takoyaki and cook it evenly.There is not a lot of seats and there is only a bench outside.
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}3}9/11/2016}I've never had takoyaki before, and the last time I visited Japan was when I was still in elementary school, so I don't really have much to compare these to. In the middle of the afternoon on a weekend, the storefront was relatively empty and service was quick. I thought the original takoyaki were reasonably priced at $7 for 6, but I don't know if this would be my go-to choice for a snack. I found them tasty, and the portion size big enough for two people to share. Just a note that the credit card minimum has been increased to $13 (don't know where they got that odd number from), but definitely hit the ATM before you arrive if you don't plan to order more than one thing from here!
Nez B.}Manhattan, NY}250}208}280}18}2}9/6/2016}I had the regular takoyaki for $7 and the okonomiyaki ($4  more) takeout and it was my first time trying it. Both were forgettable at best. I had it with a native Japanese friend and she was very disaapointed and told me the takoyaki is ok at best and the okonomiyaki was undercooked and also not good. She told me it was bad for a first experience but not to worry because there is much better. I was a little disappointed because I had high expectations but apparently  there are better and cheaper takoyaki places nearby. If you want a quick bite, its ok, but if you want better taste look elsewhere.
Scott B.}Panama City, FL}22}171}77}-1}4}9/5/2016}We stopped by today to try some Okonamayaki.  I spent 6 years on Okinawa and never had any .  We got one pork and one shrimp and they were good, not great but good.  There was a lot more shredded cabbage than I thought there would be but it was quite good.  The food was prepared quickly and it was hot.  Friendly staff too. If you are wanting to try some Okonamayaki in NYC I recommend Otafuku!
Harue J.}Manhattan, NY}12}261}31}18}2}8/31/2016}This is a small EV spot that sells cheap Japanese street food.  Small, I mean, is no seating except for a bench outside.  This place gets ppl for its "novelty" reason for selling takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and taiyaki.  They're so far from being as good as the street carts in the back streets of Japan.  Just as other cheap Asian restos here, their okonomiyaki is strangely sweet.  Their yakisoba tastes like my brother made it out of an instant package when he was in high school.  Their taiyakis take time.  When it gets crowded, they fall so behind quickly and mess up the numerical order of the orders.  But when it's not crowded, it's fine for a quick, cheap meal.  This place is serving a niche for EV kids.
Maggie L.}Brooklyn, NY}114}172}278}18}3}8/25/2016}Got the B combo: takoyaki + pork okonomiyaki.So I used to get takoyaki from Otafuku all the time before they relocated to this location, and I loved it. However, the takoyaki from this visit was a bit of a disappointment. The octopus piece in the takoyaki was very tiny compared to the whole takoyaki and a bit too rubbery. Definitely not as delicious as it used to be :(The pork okonomiyaki was okay. Nothing amazing, but the pork was too salty. But then again, it looked like it was just bacon, so that's probably why...
Matt L.}New York, NY}105}476}447}18}3}8/23/2016}This place was A-OK.Credit card minimum of $10.They serve several things here, including some Japanese bottled drinks, takoyaki, and tayakis, which are the fish shaped sweet biscuits. They don't make the takoyaki right away- they make them and then store them in a box. So, they aren't very fresh. I didn't try the tayaki, but I'll be back to try them and write an updated review.
Aylee}Brooklyn, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}8/22/2016}I've been looking around a good Japanese place that serves good takoyaki at a reasonable price for a while. Now that I've found this place, I'm satisfied. The takoyaki is soft on the outside and chewy on the inside. It's fresh and savory. I've tried the okonomiyaki and yakisoba. The yakisoba is nothing really special but the okonomiyaki is really fluffy and soft--just how an okonomiyaki should be. Definitely recommend this place. Also, order the combos, more economically efficient.
Alan S.}San Mateo, CA}0}13}1}-1}3}8/15/2016}We came to this place for its tako yaki because of their big name. We were a little bit disappointed since we there's really nothing special about their tako yaki and not sure about all the hype about their place. We can taste the squids inside the tako yaki were very fresh but the tako yaki it self was very soggy and seemed to have been sitting in the heater for a while. We had better ones before.
Jay L.}Manhattan, NY}0}19}11}-1}4}8/14/2016}It use to be better but still delicious!Takoyaki: I with the outside was more crispy, but it was warm, savory, well flavored and a good octopus bite Okonomiyaki: same as takoyaki, I wish the outside was crispier, but still delicious.
Santita N.}Ashburn, VA}295}270}700}18}4}8/13/2016}One of the best takoyaki I've ever had. Granted, I've never been to Japan, so I can't say what an "authentic" takoyaki tastes like. However, from my numerous past experiences with takoyaki, this place got it!Takoyaki is basically a pancake ball filled with octopus. Here, they've made the pancake perfectly soft on the inside, and nicely crispy on the outside. And the best thing that most places mess up on? The octopus. It was cooked perfectly, not overcooked! The size of the ball was also bigger.Top that off with some of the takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise, and dried bonito and I'm truly a happy camper! They didn't skimp on the sauces either, making sure each bite is covered with that awesome saucy flavor. I could really finish two orders of this, honestly.Ordered the combo with the yakisoba. Let me tell you right now, skip the yakisoba. It was... terrible. Tastes more like a cheap, Chinese low-mein stir-fry that's barely seasoned. The noodles were oily, and the taste leave your palette a bit sad.Come here for takoyaki, okonomiyaki, as well as their medetai (red bean or nutella/banana)!
K H.}Highland Park, NJ}15}2}1}-1}1}8/10/2016}Bad taste !!!!! Unbelievable!!!!! I have ordered a Combo there and I could't believe that those staffs are chatting while they cooking. As a result that the surface of the Okonomiyaki is over cook !!!! but inside is rare. They don't care!!!! I argued with them and they said this is their "regular thing"!!!
Lance N.}Centreville, VA}28}148}141}18}5}8/10/2016}I must say, this place is totally worth it! For 14 bucks, their portion was enough to feed me and my wife! Their takoyaki's are one of the best takoyaki's we've ever had! And, they give A LOT! not like other places where u get like 4 pieces for whopping 8 bucks or something like that. No, you get a good bit! and its crispy on the outside, and creamy delicious on the inside with that tender thing of octopus.
Hannah L.}New York, NY}229}232}604}18}3}7/10/2016}Dropped by after dinner and was ecstatic to see taiyaki on the menu. The pastry chefs make it right in front of you in cute fish molds.Space - No seating inside, but there's a wooden bench you can sit on outside. Fingers crossed it doesn't rain. Red bean taiyaki - I'm all for red bean, but this one just wasn't sweet enough and was a little dry. Banana Nutella taiyaki - Yum! I preferred this one over the red bean. The banana gave the taiyaki a little moisture and the nutella amped up the sweetness.
Gabrielle P.}Queens, NY}260}223}1660}18}3}7/8/2016}Man, I was so excited to try out Otafuku, but the food, unfortunately, fell flat. I really enjoy the Taiyaki that's made by Delimanjoo in Koreatown. The taiyaki at Otafuku was not so great, despite its golden brown fresh-out of the iron cast appearance. Argh. The texture of the fish-shaped cake that envelopes the red-bean paste filling was dry and meager. The red-bean paste was not smooth/pureed enough to my liking. It was also dry and lacking in moisture.  -sigh- Please don't tell me this is even close to how taiyaki in Japan actually tastes. Next up was the Octopus Takoyaki. The Octopus Takoyaki with the benito flakes was pretty good and flavorful. Texture was not soggy and still maintained its shape and flavor even when I left it in the refrigerator overnight. This I liked. You should totally try this when you get the chance.And finally, the Matcha Parfait. Oh God. No. Just no. The picture that's displayed is so misleading. T.T For ~$6, I got a little cup with a tiny matcha sundae, a taiyaki(w/o filling) that was violently ripped in half, some red bean paste, and a tiny mochi. The matcha sundae was overwhelmingly bitter. Taiyaki was dry as usual. The sweetness of the red bean somewhat alleviated the bitterness of the matcha. Mochi was terribly bland(no filling either), despite its deceivingly glossy exterior. blargh. Verdict: The hot-food items are worth the $, but save your $ for better sweets/dessert options around the area.
Bin L.}East Elmhurst, NY}29}348}14}18}5}7/8/2016}I came here only once during the final week of the Spring 2015 semester. Brought their takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo as a afternoon snack while studying for the final.
Kimberly J.}West Bronx, NY}13}2}1}-1}4}7/6/2016}Absolutly loved the takoyaki here!!! Best place for just a quick bite!!! Im hoping to go back for the green tea ice cream!!!
Tom G.}Rutherford, NJ}164}217}2217}-1}3}7/3/2016}I see this photo of a fish shape looking thing like a pancake and it's called Medetai from Otafuku.  And I look up the menu and I can get it with red bean or Nutella & Banana for $3.I figure I need to get something else too if I'm making the trip and I see Octopus Balls, Takoyaki.So or yea I never had those how would they feel when I put them in my mouth, are they squelchy or crunchy and does anything squirt out of them when I bite them?Well I walk in hopping to see the Medetai being made in a  their cooking mold but they had some pre-made and it took 30 seconds to bag my order of Nutella & Banana Medetai and a set of 6 Octopus Balls.The Octopus Balls are thin crispy on the outside but not crunchy, and soft and mostly empty space on the inside. They slathered a sauce and some mayo with some bonito flakes on top. there is a little piece of something inside but I could not tell what it was, a piece of Octopus something maybe but I did not like the flavor.  It left me in a blah blah state knowing I would be having Octopus Balls anytime soon.Now the Medetai was different the outside was plain but the Nutella & Banana was a good mix. If anything I would add powered sugar or something to the outside to make them better.I didn't see anything other than the Medetai in this place that would make me do a return trip and I think there is a Medetai like vendor in K-Town I could try in that case.
Krystal A.}Alexandria, VA}129}123}428}18}4}7/2/2016}My fave spot ever for takoyaki. Service was quick, and takoyakis were served piping hot.
Elaine E.}Bronx, NY}121}82}531}-1}3}7/1/2016}Price: this place is a little overpriced for my liking... At least have the quantity or the taste of the food make it worth the price.Food: Maybe I may judging it too fast since I only ordered the Medetai. I ordered the banana and nutella Medetai. It tasted decently pretty good but not like bombtastic mindblowing awesome. Also, the Medetai was A LOT SMALLER than I expected. Its around the same as the size of my palm or around that. Hmm, I'll give this place another try though for their other food items. Place: the place is pretty small; there's not chairs or tables to use inside. There's a small bench to sit outside for like 3-4 people. The place is pretty decently cleaned from what I remember. Recommendation: Imma give you a heads up; like many cheap for Manhattan places, they dont accept cards with a certain condition sighhh...
Annie T.}Bethesda, MD}481}90}2467}18}5}6/27/2016}Ok ok ok this is another restaurant I've known about for years and haven't written a review for it yet. Let me start off by saying I love Takoyaki and I try to eat them whenever I can get my hands on them. Takoyaki are grilled octopus balls with Japanese mayo, special sauce, squid bonito flakes, and garnishes on top. Otafuku is a NYC staple and must do for me when I'm visiting. They only make 3 different dishes and 2 desserts, that's literally it and people still flock to them. I always get the Takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Ive never been to Japan, but I've been told these are authentic as they come. I've tried Takoyaki in Korea, Malaysia, Maryland , Virginia, and other NYC restaurants and nothing has come close to Otafuku to me. The Takoyaki always come out piping hot and will burn your mouth, so be careful. I would love to go to Japan one day to compare and go on a Takoyaki binge spree! ;p
Nick H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}308}289}529}18}4}6/12/2016}Eating at Otafuku always satisfies but it never quite blows me away.The takoyaki are nice and hot, with a solid dashi flavor in the batter for umami, the chunks of octopus are tender. The okonomiyaki is cooked perfectly into a light, fluffy cabbage pancake with the tasty little shrimp. The taiyaki is classic and they're generous with the red bean.But there are some little things that are sometimes a let-down. Sometimes the cooks are too heavy-handed with the sauce and that worcestershire-based takoyaki sauce drowns out the flavor of everything. If they're really busy and making takoyaki too fast, not every single piece gets a chunk of octopus. Also, when they make all the takoyaki in advance and hold it in the hot box, you lose the ability to taste the separate ingredients in the takoyaki- the benishoga, the tenkasu, the scallion and it just tastes like dashi custard. With the taiyaki, it's a simple street food snack and when it's not made to order, the crispness on the outside is completely lost as it steams up in the box.Overall, the flavors are good and the prices are okay but Otafuku just isn't quite 5 stars for me.
David B B.}Maplewood, NJ}27}290}13}18}3}5/30/2016}I've been meaning to try okonomiyaki for some time, so I was excited to check out otafuku. I got the combo with the shrimp oko and the hot shrimp yakisoba. (I know the pork is supposed to be better, but I'd rather not eat meat if I can avoid it.)The okonomiyaki was very enjoyable, with sweet, smoky, and umami flavors hitting me one after the other. I think I'd have a hard time eating two of them, making the $9 entree a solid deal. The "shrimp" were the creepy little wiggles that you get out of a can. Even at that price point, they could do better than that--especially considering that they don't have to pay for seating. Still, if this had been the only thing I ordered, I probably would have given a 4.The yakisoba was nasty. It tasted like pasta tossed with onion soup mix, an ungodly amount of oil, and more of those creepy wiggle-shrimp. I threw it out.I'll probably be back, but just for the okonomiyaki.
Kristi K.}New York, NY}0}11}0}-1}5}5/28/2016}The food is so tasty! Unlike some other reviews have stated, our food has always been made to order! And there's no misunderstanding about it, as your food is prepared right in front of you. My favorite is the Takoyaki + Okonomiyaki combo, but yakisoba and medetai are both good as well. Prices are great! Since there is no inside seating, coming here during winter time takes a bit more willpower.
Wah X.}Flushing, NY}7}7}1}-1}4}5/21/2016}We ordered Combo A and D. It was our first time here, but trying it once would be enough for me. Taste and foods were not that exceptional.
Danver Q.}Edison, NJ}472}76}229}-1}5}5/14/2016}My gf really wanted to come here for takoyaki, which I've never had before and really good! I was pretty unsure how'd I would feel about it, but it was pretty irresistible! They have combos which are perfect for lunch and snacks! The place itself is pretty small, but there's a bench outside and parks all around anyways. It's really cool how you can see the takoyaki and other foods being prepared.
Reina K.}Saint Paul, MN}0}16}2}-1}2}5/7/2016}Takoyaki is prepped ahead of time and sitting, okonomiyaki was inconsistent from the time to time that i've had it, and in general both aren't very flavorful. They just dump a bunch of sauce on it. Also not that cheap, as prices rose when they moved. I still go maybe once or twice a semester if I'm craving takoyaki, but it seems the quality has decreased since they moved. Probably won't go again. Staff was nice though.
Yikai L.}New York, NY}95}335}525}-1}3}5/3/2016}Have tried the takoyaki, yummy! Posters on the walls recommend their medetai too.
Cynthia J.}Los Angeles, CA}22}427}47}18}2}5/2/2016}I love takoyaki, and I was super duper excited to try a NY takoyaki... (that's how much I love them)I literally made my friends take a detour so we could try this place.First off, there wasn't any other customers. You'd think they would make fresh takoyakis for us... WRONG! They gave us takoyaki that clearly had been made hours earlier.The flavor fell flat of expectations. It wasn't anything to rave about. I should have told the worker I was from Cali and ask for some fresh balls! But that thought didn't occur to me.
Elaine L.}Fresh Meadows, NY}11}15}30}-1}5}4/20/2016}Been following the takoyaki maker when they were further west, still a bit much for takoyaki but you just can't resist the wafting smell*:.｡. o()o .｡.:*
Priscilla K.}Brooklyn, NY}5}10}17}-1}2}4/18/2016}I didn't know it was possible to achieve overcooked and mushy at the same time but they've done it. Paste like texture and the pork so burnt it's synonymous with the taste of chicken.
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}2}4/18/2016}I didn't have high expectations, but for a place that has 4 items on their menu (takoyaki, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and medetai), I am going to assume you do them well. I gave the takoyaki and okonomiyaki a shot, but they were, to be honest, not good. The takoyaki was large, but mostly starch and very little tako. The okonomiyaki felt like it was only fried cabbage. I've had much, much better takoyaki and okonomiyaki at other establishments that don't even specialize in them.
Annabelle M.}Manhattan, NY}26}143}119}-1}3}4/16/2016}Good casual, fast-food Japanese place to quickly stop for a snack. I like how you can see the octopus balls being made right behind the counter. Their four different combinations of snacks pretty much cover everything on their menu.The red bean fish is not as good as some of the ones I've had in Koreatown. The paste is minimal in amount and the bread is very thin.
Anh T.}Roselle Park, NJ}0}17}13}-1}5}4/7/2016}Best place in NY to get takoyaki!! I don't care that there isn't a seating area. Just order your food and eat outside or stand. It's not a large meal but the flavors are dynamite.
Gyra P.}Azusa, CA}1}19}8}-1}3}4/1/2016}I came here on a recommendation from someone after hearing my love for Takoyaki . I came here late afternoon and when I arrived I was surprised that the business was a stop and go more than a dining establishment . I was kind of disappointed since I wanted to sit down and enjoy the food I was going to order after a long day at work . I ordered the Combo B(the takoyaki & Okonomiyaki) plus a medetai(Nutella & Banana) . I didn't catch that it was CASH ONLY and that they didn't take $100 bills . Luckily my partner had cash with him so everything went fine . We didn't wait too long for our food but 2 customers after me got their food before I did . Maybe because they only ordered Takoyaki and nothing else ? I was watching the guy make the Takoyaki balls and I couldn't wait to see how they were going to make the medetai but I was disappointed when I saw him take one from the heat lamps and warmed it up on the grill . They put Takoyaki balls up there too but I luckily got one of the fresh batches . I would've liked the Takoyaki and Medetai made and served fresh, I think it makes a difference in flavor and texture . For flavor the Takoyaki passes at 7/10The Okonomiyaki passes at 8/10& the medetai was 5/10 . The overall experience was good . $15 for everything might be pricey for some but to others it maybe just right . However, I wouldn't call this the BEST place for Takoyaki, I've had better . Will I be back ? Yes. But not as a frequent customer .
Janice L.}Santa Monica, CA}206}175}4474}18}4}3/29/2016}Great place, more catered to to-go customers. Among a bunch of other Japanese restaurants.Came for the takoyaki, and the medai.One star off for running out of medai red beans, some of my friends had to get the banana nutella instead.But the red bean medai was awesome, wish the red bean was more spread out thoughWill come back in the summer for the matcha parfait!
Susan L.}New York, NY}160}195}1137}18}3}3/24/2016}I really wanted to try this place after I bookmarked it for so many months already~.So I went with my friend after school and I ordered the Combo B. My friend and I ordered the same Combo. I have to say they were fast on making it. Remember to take a combo stamp card! Service: It was okay, after I got my food, I asked for the receipt and the lady just glared at me... Like wth... I just needed the receipt to keep record of my spendings.. Is that wrong to do so? So she just gave me back the number receipt... Like wth.. That was one star taken away. I mean if a customer asks for a receipt at least give it to them and not glare at them...Food: Woah there! Go easy on the sauce! The okonomiyaki and the takoyaki was bomb! I chose the pork for the okonomiyaki~. It was really good but a little bit salty. I give it 4/5 stars.The takoyaki was really good! It came in 6 balls and I have to say it was bomb as well. They gave a lot of bonito flakes and it was really Instagram worthy. The squid was not rubbery and that made it really good. I feel like the dough was a little to much but, it was fine. I give the takoyaki 4.5/5 stars. Be prepared to sit outside because there aren't seats inside. There just counter were you can stand and eat your food. Also remember, they don't take cards only cash! They don't accept $100 bills. If you come in on Tuesdays and show your student Id, they give you 10percent off for the combo.I would come here again just for the food. However, please consider on your attitude please.
Kate S.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}3/16/2016}Very small place but has really good takoyaki and okonomiyaki!! wish they had a sitting area for eating inside..
Michelle L.}Quincy, MA}131}38}11}-1}4}3/14/2016}The takoyaki was delicious, and it tastes pretty authentic. It was completely hot and fresh, and the sauces and bonito flakes went so well with the batter and perfectly cooked octopus.
Faith L.}Manhattan, NY}3}18}0}-1}3}3/12/2016}Not as good as the old location... The okonomiyaki and takoyaki were under done. The yakisoba is still good and tasty.
Annie K.}Manhattan, NY}12}75}222}-1}4}3/1/2016}I love their takoyaki! The only thing I really eat that has octopus inside. The octopus is not too rubbery, which is perfect. Do be careful eating them right after your order is ready because these little balls may look cooled, but eating one in a single mouthful will burn! Letting them cool down completely is a sin though! Definitely best eaten while they are still piping hot! ;) The taiyaki is good too--the red bean paste was really smooth, didn't have a chunky bean texture at all, but there were a few stray bean skins here and there. I've also had their okonomiyaki and yakisoba noodles in the past. They were decent too, but personally, I'm not really a fan of the heavy worchester sauce flavor that goes into yakisoba. Japanese places in NYC really don't offer the best okonomiyaki, but I would say this place does it slightly better than other sit-in Japanese restaurants.
Sonia A.}Bronx, NY}19}19}50}-1}5}2/28/2016}I absolutely love their takoyaki always fresh and delicious! Friendly staff and even friendly customers !! You must come try.
Jennifer L.}Manhattan, NY}175}358}457}18}4}2/14/2016}I really love takiyaki and I was glad I stumbled upon this place. I came here on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty. I quickly ordered the medetai ($3). It is the fish waffle. They had two flavors: red bean and hazelnut chocolate with Nutella. The hazelnut chocolate with Nutella was pretty good. They already had the one I ordered prepared beforehand, so it wasn't piping hot. But it was good. It was a little fluffy than I am used to and the filling was a little meager. The overall taste was okay, but nothing to remember.The shop also has takoyaki ($7), okonomiyaki ($9), and yakisoba ($8). I really want to come back and try the other items! Even though the takiyaki wasn't that impressive, I still think the store is deserving of four stars. They really try to make the foods well and are very neat and hygienic in preparation. They also make their okonomiyaki and yakisoba fresh to order!
Carrie S.}FLUSHING, NY}2}24}56}-1}3}2/12/2016}I came here specifically for the medetai and I was disappointed. I got the banana Nutella one and was so excited but after taking the first bite, I was already sad. Even though I know the first bite often does not have any filling, it was dry and hard to swallow. After I took a few more bites and reached the filling, it got significantly better. However, it was merely warm when I received mine and I expected more. This place got my hyped up for no reason.
Tony C.}Great Neck, NY}218}192}382}18}4}2/8/2016}I like this place, anytime we r in the area we would stop by and pick up an order of takoyaki ($7). It's a very small shop with standing room that fits a handful of people and that's it.
Kai P.}Forest Hills, NY}1}7}1}-1}5}1/25/2016}Monday, January 25th, 1:34 PMThe reason I had came to this location in the first place was because I wanted to try some taiyaki. Otafuku was the only place I knew about that wasn't super far away from my school.When I entered, there were only about 3 people. The entire place is pretty small, so you can eat indoors only while standing up. However, there are also wooden benches outside. Like all other reviews say, the menu is really not that wide, but in a good way. (For a New Year's Special, they have a matcha medetai for $4.50). Upon entering, I ordered the two red bean medetai and also bought a really cute apple soda. I was notified that my order would take about 10-12 minutes, which was totally okay. After waiting 10 minutes and getting my medetai in cute small bags, I took them outside to eat. The staff seemed nice and didn't talk about any personal business while I was there.The fresh medetai are really good. Because I came at a not-so-common time, they had to be made fresh. The batter (when cooked) is extremely nice and fluffy. It tastes like a waffle I guess, which is good. The red bean paste in the center has a nice creamy texture (like how good red bean paste should be) and it's not too sweet.I will definitely be coming back to get more, ahaha. I definitely recommend this place for it's medetai!
Ladiny P.}New York, NY}83}56}227}-1}2}1/23/2016}Honestly, this is one of the most disappointing places I have ever been to.I came here with my brother one Friday afternoon to try this place out which was recommended by my best friend.I ordered Combo A (~$9.00) which included a 6-piece takoyaki and a medatai (pretty much a taiyaki). My brother ordered Combo C (~$14.00) which included 6-piece takoyaki and shrimp yakisoba. Our order took about 10 minutes and out of all the items we ordered, the only item that was fresh was the yakisoba. The takoyaki and taiyaki had obviously been sitting under a heating lamp for hours and tasted unpleasant. The takoyaki was indeed hot in the inside, but warm on the outside. The texture was just awful as it was tough to bite (very similar to eating chips that have been left sitting out for hours, very stale texture), and the inside, thought it was hot, was PINK inside. Never have I ever ate takoyaki that was pink inside. The red bean taiyaki was also very disappointing. I saw that it was also taken from their heat lamp area and just heated up. Literally tasted like it was leftovers from a day ago. The red bean filling was simply too sweet that it made my throat hurt and the outside pretty much tasted like stale bread. (Mitsuwa's taiyaki beats this place anytime!)I tried a bite of my brother's yakisoba, and it was nothing special. Literally fried noodles with frozen baby shrimp all combined together and definitely not worth $14. Food/ Beverage: disappointing, stale-tasting outer shell for takoyaki and taiyaki (like it has been left out for hours), Pink-red takoyaki inside and extremely sweet red bean paste. Appearance: small, simple, very woody (no seats just a long table against the wall which you stand and eat)Service: the cashier pretty much was talking to her co-worker while I was waiting to order. I felt like I had take the initiative in ordering and what I wanted since she didn't really offer her services (like what to recommend me, nor did she speak in tone that was welcoming)Price: average, just not worth the price for quality and portion ($7-$20)I had read reviews earlier about this place, and even read articles saying how this place was one of the top places for takoyaki. Clearly, since this article was published, their food quality has sunk dramatically. Maybe business got into their heads or simply I came when it wasn't busy so they didn't make a fresh batch, but I have decided not try this place again. Clearly the food was not worth the price, both in portion and quality as well as the service was not up to par.
Lisa R.}Denver, CO}255}982}60}18}4}1/18/2016}I love this place! It's a really fun treat and worth a visit when showing out of town guests the EV. I wish they would bring back the takoyaki with cheese though!!! It was always a fave of mine.
Yiying P.}New York, NY}24}8}10}-1}5}1/18/2016}I tried the matcha flavor medetai. It's delicious! Moderate sweetness. Maybe I'll try red bean medetai next time.
Winnie G.}Boston, MA}86}51}27}-1}5}1/17/2016}Cute Takayaki, reasonably priced and great for a late night snack. Thier other menu options are quite large and delicious and you will be very satisfied!
Gloria Z.}San Mateo, CA}0}1}0}-1}4}1/17/2016}Delicious food. Tasted good! Though the waitress was a little cold. I was excited to find some Japanese drinks there.
Christina D.}New York, NY}1}7}10}-1}5}1/16/2016}I had the combo a for $10 (okonomiyaki and takoyaki) !! It was the first time I had okonomiyaki and I thought it was really good, good enough that I returned on the same week for the second time with another group of friends for more. The takoyaki were better than most places I've had it. they're also bigger too :-) The benches outside are really nice to sit outside and eat if the weather is good. Overall the food was really satisfying for my stomach. The lady behind the cashier was really nice, she gave me two stamps to make up for the first time I visited and I forgot to stamp!
Emily W.}Forest Hills, NY}60}82}671}18}5}1/16/2016}They have some of the best Takoyaki! I normally come here to eat takoyaki on my way home from work and it really makes things better after long hours at work. This place is very small: two benches outside and a table on the side of the wall to place your food on to eat while standing. Overall, this has a cultural festival feel which makes the food more delicious. Definitely try the takoyaki as well as everything else! The food is pretty pricy per item, though the combo is cheaper. But it's worth the price!
Daniel S.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}473}323}1368}18}4}1/16/2016}If you are around St. Marks and looking for a quick delicious snack I recommend you to come here and try the Takoyaki! $7 will go far to please your tastebuds. The takoyaki comes with 6 balls each glazed with sauce and mayonnaise and topped with sliced live squid flakes (just kidding not live, but moving). Water is $1.
Kara C.}Anaheim, CA}1}27}15}-1}5}1/15/2016}Delicious okonomiyaki and takoyaki! It is a standup place so if you're looking for a sit down place this isn't the place for you.The food is freshly made to order and you get so much food. My mom and I both got a combo and we could have split one!Love it here. Perfect for grabbing your food to go or a quick but filling me delicious bite!
Heather P.}Manhattan, NY}295}27}27}-1}5}1/12/2016}This has to be one of my favorite places in the world, not even just NYC. I remember coming to this place when it used to be a little hole in the wall down the street when I was a student at NYU - recently revisited and it has really grown and renovated! Had to come two days in a row, and I'm still dreaming about their takoyaki. Don't even care that it's cash only and inconvenient.They only serve about four things on the menu - takoyaki, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and medetai. I love that they also come in combos. We tried everything, and everything was made fresh and delicious. I had been craving good takoyaki for months, and this definitely satiated that craving. Although now I'm craving it again. Just a word of warning not to pop the entire takoyaki ball into your mouth if it's just made because you will burn the inside of your mouth pretty bad (happened to us) - still worth it though. The okonomiyaki is also delicious with a crispy exterior. Loved the little rice cake balls in the special matcha medetai. They also have a big refrigerator with many different types of imported Japanese bottled drinks - we dared each other to try the yogurt water and some other yogurt-type drink, and they were all really good!
Linda L.}Brooklyn, NY}46}137}16}-1}2}1/12/2016}I used to love this place but the original people who used to make the takoyaki's and okinomiyaki's are no longer making the food.  The taste and quality has definitely lowered.
Alexa X.}San Francisco, CA}68}73}51}-1}3}1/11/2016}Was here in 2013 and the quality was way better then--more octopus bits, etc. They expanded the place now, so it's more spacious and you have a place to eat in. The menu now includes drinks(mediocre selection and quality).
Mei L.}New York, NY}0}183}1}-1}4}1/8/2016}I finally tried this place!  Every time I am around here, I just finished dinner and is way too full to eat anymore.  Well I did just have dinner but was not satisfied with the food so did not eat that much.  So my friends and I stopped by to get some dessert. Yea right! We ended up eating more takoyaki which was delicious and the metedai.  I shared a combo of 6 takoyaki and a chocolate & banana metedai. I would definitely come back for the takoyaki, so good, cheap and fast!  The metedai on the other hand was another story...how can they make it in front of me and still taste stale?  Maybe it was the flour? I don't know.  The filling of chocolate and banana was good though, just be careful eating it since the chocolate is melted.  I ended up wearing some of the chocolate on my long hair and coat.
Celia Z.}New York, NY}245}307}747}-1}4}1/7/2016}Love this little place.  Unfortunately only cash, but absolutely delicious.Sometimes there can be a little bit of a wait for food, approximately 10 mins.  But sometimes, that's the best, as the little octopus balls come straight out of the molds.  The two sauces drizzled on really seal the deal.  The pancakes are pretty good, too.The one thing I do get annoyed by is when they keep an inventory of already made octopus balls in the heater oven, and it no longer tastes fresh.  But I'm usually too impatient to wait for another batch...
Angela W.}New York, NY}73}143}231}18}2}1/6/2016}The place lacks customer service. I have been here a few times and each time is the same, or worse. The takoyaki is okay at best, it's definitely not something that I would go out of my way to go and get. Only once, which was really surprising, my order took less than 10 minutes to come out. Again, not the best quality compared to the other times I had it in which the order took longer to come out. I would recommend this place if you're around and near the area and want something somewhat quick. Other than that, this is a place I would definitely not go out of my way to get.
Wanyi C.}Bloomington, IN}184}35}68}-1}5}1/2/2016}I love it! So cheap! Highly recommend! I had the combo A and it only cost 10 dollors. I am full already.
Vicky Z.}Brooklyn, NY}223}32}7}-1}2}1/1/2016}I ordered takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and the banana nutella medetai. The takoyaki and okonomiyaki were both undercooked and mushy on the inside. The nutella banana medetai was good, but I didn't think it was very special. Since they are not made fresh (they are made earlier, kept warm, and then reheated), the banana tastes over ripe. 2 stars for good service. It was also nice seeing how the food was made, even though it wasn't the best.
Jonas B.}Belleville, NJ}0}29}0}-1}5}12/30/2015}We have been goin here for the longest time and its just so amazingly good. Takoyakis are so addicting. It's like eating a piece of heaven for me. They are just so good. Let me tell you people, me and my wife drive a good 30-45 min just to get there and we dont mind at all because it is so worth it.
Aderlin F.}New York, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}12/28/2015}Miss the old otafuku... it was more traditional and felt much more authentic but I still have not found better takoyaki in NYC :)
Victoria M.}New York, NY}2}88}74}-1}3}12/22/2015}The red bean Taiyaki is worth a try. Takoyaki is okay. Never had those fried rice/noodles but looks good. Always had a quick bite here after my French class.
Shuyu L.}Flushing, NY}21}19}4}-1}4}12/20/2015}I like how their food used to be, since they have a little change on the flavor, didn't go there often. I like to catch up the fresh made takoyaki balls just get done from the heat.
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}4}12/19/2015}I've been a frequenter of this place ever since I was a Freshman in college, which was 7 years ago. holy eff I am old. I was definitely a bigger fan of the previous hole in the wall that was actually a hole in the wall...and the recipe has changed somehow as well. They have the little cake makers now that lacks the originality of the way ti was made previously (they were all different sizes and shapes) and now they are uniformly and in freakishly perfect sizes which is not necessarily a bad thing I suppose. This has not hindered me, however, from coming here every chance I get. It is cheap, fast, consistently delicious. Although having tried everything on the menu, takoyaki is still the only thing I would order. They added medetai pretty recently......but it is not nearly as impressive of a dessert.......you can also buy your own in the frozen section at sunrise mart and heat it yourself (it is sweeter and cheaper albeit less healthy). If you havent' been here. You must go. now. the end.
Diana P.}Flushing, NY}0}4}0}-1}2}12/7/2015}May be I was too expecting this place to be tasty. It didn't reach my expectation. Specially Takoyaki was too much flours and too little Toko(Octopus) and the Medetai red bean was not fresh at all. I think they made them earlier and selling it. Only thing I liked was Okonomiyaki. It was not bad but I couldn't really find the shrimps. :(
Sol L.}Manhattan, NY}8}12}0}-1}1}12/5/2015}Slowest place I have ever been to in New York. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else
Alyssa Y.}New York, NY}69}240}39}18}2}12/3/2015}Shockingly slow for a hole in the wall, takeout joint. Plus the takoyaki and okonomiyaki were undercooked. Everything was just complete mush. Maybe it depends on the line cook? I don't care to go back to find out...Also, I thought the portions were too large -- way too much for one person and it won't keep for leftovers. Bring someone to share with, especially if you want to try a couple things. Though not a date since it's messy to eat and the only seating is one sad looking bench outside.
Lily H.}Edison, NJ}498}451}798}18}4}11/30/2015}Love Otafuku. Easy to get an on the go meal. Okonomiyaki (seafood pancake) or takoyaki (octopus ... spheres). Quality varies highly, however, by who is working. I poke my head in and do a quick assessment of how lazy the person looks. Going against my instincts has resulted in undercooked takoyaki.Ask them not to put too much sauce either.
Kay W.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}3}43}111}-1}5}11/28/2015}If you are the takoyaki lover, this place is a must..always hop in for the takoyaki craving..
Jason L.}Gallup, NM}131}125}291}-1}3}11/26/2015}Ordered the Combo A which is six takoyaki and okonomiyaki ($10). This is not the best takoyaki I've had but it was a solid option. Crispy on the outside and it didn't have as much octopus in the inside. But it was warm and fluffy on the inside. The mayo sauce, green onion, ginger, and katsuobushi flakes was on point. I ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki (Japanese Pancake) which was great but the shrimp was small. I think, next time we will order the pork. Combo A is a great opinion to share with someone as a light snack. I like how quickly they serve the food here. This place is very small so it not a place for small talk, it really just order, eat (standing), and ditch.
Dan K.}New York, NY}220}359}24}18}3}11/22/2015}OTAfuku literally moved down the street from their old locale, but it still the same goodness. This is one of those hole in a wall Japanese street food joints with practically no seating. Gotta bring that to-go game strong for this one. This place is best known for its octopus/seafood balls and its red bean pastry desert options.  SetB is the way to go! I also had the matcha icecream up here. So let's breakdown the taste. The cost to portions to quality/taste is average. They whip up some major flavor with the mayo style sauces and fish flakes on top of the various dishes they offer at the joint. But it tends to be a little overpowering especially on the sweet side. The fish pastries are pretty on the money and are classic for any AZN street vendor consumers up in here. The matcha ice cream was disappointing mainly because it wasn't ice cream. It was straight up liquid that was super grainy. Idunno man that killed it for me. Finally, dem prices a little too high... by like 2-3 bills. The sets and dishes range from $7-10, but to be honest the type of food and the portions I'd say it should be measured at $5-8. So its really a dig at whoever wants the want ya know. Easy eating fam!
Cindy K.}New York, NY}612}238}255}18}4}11/17/2015}I've always will have a soft spot for this place. So far the best takoyaki place in the city I've found. Been going to this place since my early years in college (6-7 years ago now? lol).I do feel as though since they have moved to the larger location that the quality and taste of the takoyaki & okonomiyaki has gone down...maybe different ingredients or just the chef making their own variation...I don't really know.They do have a frequent rewards card now which is a plus. $7 bucks for 6 takoyaki balls and around $10 for the combos which include the yakisoba, okonomiyaki, or the taiyaki.
Jen N.}Floral Park, NY}103}115}258}18}2}11/14/2015}My friend took me here because I was craving takoyaki around St Marks. It's nice that you can see them make it but I feel like by the time I came here the takoyaki had been sitting out for awhile. Takoyaki is best when it's made to order so this was a bit disappointing. The sauce and the toppings were good and I suppose the price of $7 for 6 of them is as expected since takoyaki is hard to find in the city. The place is small not really good for eating in groups more of a grab and go place. Overall I would not come back here. I've had better it's just too bad that the places that we're better so far are not to be found in NYC.
Carolyn O.}Long Beach, CA}5}26}4}-1}5}11/10/2015}Best Takoyaki balls I have had.   Much better than any sit down restaurant!  The Bonito flakes were kinda smokey, super thinly sliced  and slightly chewy!   The takoyaki balls came in a wooden boat too which was kinda cool and interesting.
Patrick J B.}New York, NY}0}25}0}-1}4}11/6/2015}Okonomiyaki isn't as easy to find in this city as I would like, so stumbling upon a place that specializes in it feels like winning the lottery. The okonomiyaki is solid at Otafuku. Get the pork over the shrimp. You're not going to get the same quality of food as you would in Japan, but it's certainly passable. The takoyaki can be hit or miss, but they're not always freshly cooked. The Yakisoba is decent. The wait can be LONG. I've waited upwards of 25 minutes a few times and I always say I'll never go back, but alas, I crave okonomiyaki again. Cash only, but you can find them on Seamless sometimes and delivery is quick through a 3rd party service.
Karen W.}Los Angeles, CA}434}248}1204}-1}4}11/3/2015}Takoyaki (6 pcs): octopus and batter balls, $7 Okonomiyaki (2 pcs): savory pancakes with cabbage and pork or (baby) shrimp, $9Taiyaki (1 pc): fish-shaped pastry cake filled with red bean, $3We went for Combo A: Takoyaki (6 pcs) + Okonomiyaki for $10, which good value and very delicious. With a Taiyaki ($3) to finish it off, the 2 of us were full-up satisfied. If ever I return to NYC for this, I'd opt for Takoyaki + Taiyaki (Combo B, $9) since the Tako really stuck out to me and the Taiyaki is a sweet something I look for to counterbalance the savory. Their Tako is solid because of the carefully crafted octopus to batter ratio. The grilled octopus is a good-sized chunk to the soft, doughy and lightly crispy ball of batter. These babies are drenched in special sauce and mayo though, so I'd suggest requesting to go light or served on the side. Extra bonito flakes isn't a bad idea :)The Okonomiyaki is made fresh to order so be prepared to wait anywhere from 12-15 min. depending on how busy it is. Takos are made in advance and kept warm, so there's little hassle there. Same for Taiyakis.
Anna N.}New York, NY}0}2}8}-1}3}10/26/2015}The place is small and there is no inner seating....There is one bench outside but that's no way to treat a customer. Takoyaki and okonimayaki is good. The fish pancake is dry to me though. Just would like the Takoyaki a bit more crunchier inside.
Malia V.}Downtown Brooklyn, NY}253}23}42}-1}5}10/23/2015}I came here with friends for dessert during the most recent hurricane. It was right next to Yakiniku west and we wanted to avoid the rain and cold. I'm so happy someone decided to open the door to this place to find some warmth. I got the chocolate medetai and maybe it's due to the circumstances but it was incredibly warm and filling.  I want to come back to try the okonomiyaki and takoyaki. Since leaving Hawaii I've been craving these Japanese street foods.
Patrick A.}Kirkland, Canada}66}36}0}-1}3}10/18/2015}6 Takoyaki for $7, a little bit on the expensive side, I would say it's worth $5 at best.The takoyaki was not made fresh, but they served it from a heating cabinet resulting in a sort of warm meal, but not hot as served in Japan.As others have mentioned, they do go overboard on the bonito, but that's not the end of the world, it just gets a bit messy when eating outdoors on a windy day.I don't think I would come here again due to the high price and mediocre quality.
Larry R.}Brooklyn, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}10/16/2015}Best takoyaki I've had since I first had them in Japan. Great place
Vicky L.}Seattle, WA}10}498}8}-1}4}9/30/2015}Actually I think this place is a little bit hyper. Too much flour and little octopus. Taiyaki is not surprising either.
Allan X.}Manhattan, NY}10}13}7}-1}3}9/26/2015}I guess I'm not a takoyaki connoisseur but mostly I taste the everything but the octopus and really I don't think they have a taste anyway.  So for  6 balls of really flour and toppings,  $7 is quite expensive...  I doubt will be going there again or recommending it.But nice people and I guess if your just curious about Japanese food,  its a good place.
Joanna M.}Brooklyn, NY}150}26}45}-1}4}9/15/2015}I remember first trying takoyaki at a subpar place and then giving it another shot here. It was a good call. The takoyaki here was big and fluffy. They can overload a bit on the bonito flakes but The takoyaki themselves are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Be careful not to burn yourself eating these and eating them may be a bit messy. The banana nutella taiyaki is satisfying. Nothing special and a bit small. There are also no seats inside so you have to stand and eat. There's a bench outside which is the only place to sit.
Maylynn M.}Brooklyn, NY}7}17}17}-1}3}9/12/2015}I got the Combo A(Takoyaki + Medetai/Taiyaki) with the red bean filling taiyaki. I burned my tongue while eating a takoyaki, but it's alright. There weren't many people there when I visited, so I got my order pretty quickly. Staff was polite, which I really appreciate. However, the food itself in my opinion was merely "OK". Good, but not great. I split it with my friend, who really liked it, but to me, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.I did somewhat enjoy it nonetheless. Would I go back? Maybe, but I'm not busting my butt to. I do think it's worth a visit though, just because it is so rare to find legit Japanese street food.
Jessica P.}New York, NY}351}216}5}18}3}9/11/2015}Warm and soggy. I guess that's what I get for getting them right before they closed. After I paid, I realized they had a couple boxes of premade takoyaki.Should have known! I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt, but my experience was subpar to any other takoyaki stands I've been to.
Kris Y.}Manhattan, NY}111}127}205}18}3}9/11/2015}My go to for takoyaki! Always end up getting the set/combo so I can collect stamps.  Last time I went it seems that they don't hand flip the takoyaki anymore?   I noticed when I ordered takoyaki the staff took already made takoyaki from a heating cabinet (there were 3-4 takoyaki on standby).  Don't know how long it was in there,  but it wasn't the same quality like I usually get, it seemed more drier.  I'll check back another day if I'm in the area.
Lorelei D.}New York, NY}60}1170}1133}-1}3}9/10/2015}Liked everything I hard, it's nice that stuff is really made fresh. Would go back for the takoyaki.
M P.}Omaha, NE}2}106}5}-1}2}9/10/2015}One of my favorite take-out shops in nyc, or it used to be. The place has moved a few steps down from the old address, expanded the inside, and completely changed the staff and obviously the cooks. The takoyaki, while once delicous with a firm consistency and generous piece of octopus, were now so doughy that it just tasted like deep fried batter. The okonomiyaki, one of my favorite dishes that I used to eat the entire portion in one sitting, was now so lathered in sauce that I could barely eat more than a few bites. The pancake was super-thick (not light and delicate like before) and though it was dripping in sweet sauce and mayo lacked any real, authentic flavor. It seems the business has been expanded and the cooking process streamlined but along the way they lost the quality that made it worth coming back. What a shame.
Janus C.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}626}458}9}18}2}9/9/2015}Their okonomiyaki turns out to be a messy, floury blob of cabbage, and is not flavorful. Same with their takoyaki, I've definitely had better.
Cindy C.}Flushing, NY}77}50}128}-1}4}9/8/2015}This was my first time coming to the new location. I've been to the old location numerous times (two to three stores down) my first reaction coming in was the employees. They weren't asain. Not being racist or anything but that was my first reaction when walking into the store.  I guess that doesn't mean much. I was excited to try the takoyaki balls. It's been a long time since I last had it. I ordered a combo meal it it took roughly 30 mins . Luckily there were seats outside. When they food was finally ready we went for the balls. It was amazing. Could have used a little more sauce but it was still great. The okonomiyaki was okay .didn't have much flavor
Benoit L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}1}-1}1}9/4/2015}Ordered Okonomiyaki, got some grilled cabbage. I have been going Otafuku for years, the quality has been going down
Tiffany T.}Pittsburgh, PA}0}3}0}-1}4}8/22/2015}The takoyaki is really good. Its better if they run out and have to make it fresh but otherwise still good. I wished they had places to sit instead of just benches.
Sam R.}New York, NY}14}16}0}-1}3}8/17/2015}Came here 2 times. Once was just to get a taiyaki to pass up some time while my friend and I were waiting for the bar angel's shares to open. The taiyaki (nutella + banana) was decent! I liked it alot. Came back two days later to actually try the food- the takoyaki x yakisoba (combo C, i believe). After reading a few reviews about this place on yelp just now- it seems as if their speciality is the octopus balls (takoyaki). Both the balls and the noodles (yakisoba) were unremarkable, by no means bad... but by no means anything amazing or good even, kinda just A-OK (just like this 3 star rating). I feel the takoyaki had too much batter in them? is that even possible? like is that a legitimate complaint? but anyways, i digress... that's just IMO... too much batter and not enough octopus. The yakisoba was okay too- uhmmmm, nothing really more to add! I believe there's different sauces you can request for the yakisoba... which i did not do... but i feel like i should have.Anyways, overall, come to this establishment and try it for yourself! it's decent for what it is!
Y G.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}0}138}1}-1}3}8/17/2015}in the neighborhood and decided to get my takoyaki fix.  hadn't had it in a while.  They seem a but slow and when I was stadning on line, they kept yelling out an order number and no one came to pick it up then when I finally got to order, he's still yelling that order.  It was the same order as mine and when after calling out a few more times, he called my number suddenly.  Clearly they decided to give it to me.  While It wasn't exactly freshly made, I didn't mind as I dont' like to wait any longer either but wish they wouldn't be SO OBVIOUS.  The balls were okay, light and fluffy, not enough ginger but there was at least a octopus in each bite.  Prob not worth a trip back.  Not cheap either, $7 plus tax.
Wei T.}New York, NY}15}84}37}-1}2}8/16/2015}I'm a fan of takoyaki, but don't like them here. Too soft on the outside. I would prefer a crispy outside with soft inside.... And on the pricy side for these little appetizer.
Say R.}Long Island City, NY}0}5}0}-1}2}8/12/2015}Disappointing... がっかり〜I miss the old Otafuku. It's been a while since I went to Otafuku and was surprised to see the new location. It looks nice, but the food quality has taken a dive, as many other reviewers have noted.My mom, originally from Japan, and I, a Japexican New Yorker, shared an order of takoyaki, and an okonomiyaki/yakisoba combo. The takoyaki was ok, the yakisoba had giant pieces of uncooked cabbage, but was otherwise edible, unfortunately the real disappointment was the okonomiyaki. The outside of the okonomiyaki was black, as if burnt, but more likely the cooking surface wasn't clean and the inside was undercooked. We decided that in the future it would just be better to make our own at home.A note on customer service, according to my mother who went in before I got there...she entered the store and it was empty, no other customers and my mom, addressing the cashier, said "sumimasen" (excuse me in Japanese) and the cashier just kept looking down at her phone...she said it again...no reaction...then she asked her in English "Are you OK?" and finally the cashier looked up and took her order. Not cool...a little effort to be aware of your surroundings goes a long way.We also tried the taiyaki and were rather befuddled that they assumed we wanted Nutella and banana when the standard is red bean filling. We got the right flavor and they were good, but did not make up for the rest of this disappointing meal (ｰ ｰ;)
May H.}Queens, NY}578}73}152}-1}1}8/10/2015}I ordered the matcha parfait and I was very disappointed. The matcha ice cream was melting by the time I got my order. The red bean and the taiyaki was edible but it was really dry. All in all it was pretty awful.. I couldn't finish it even while sharing it with my friend.
Jeanne P.}Mountain View, CA}70}127}601}18}4}8/7/2015}I first had their takoyaki 2 years ago when they were still located at Stuyvesant St. Maybe I was just unlucky but the cashiers at that time were rude. If I ran into them again after the relocation, I'd probably give a lower rating.That aside, I feel the cooks aren't very skilled. I watched them prepare the octopus balls and they take long to flip them. I've had Tanota Takoyaki in Los Angeles and so far they're the best. They have really skilled cooks who flip the balls just as well as cooks from Japan (check YouTube). But if I were to compare Otafuku's takoyaki with GoSquared, I'd say the latter is better.But anyway, Otafuku's takoyaki was pretty legit. I mean, they serve them in boats! The wasabi mayonnaise was interesting too. I like how the outer shell is crunchy without the need of deep frying. The octopus pieces weren't that generous, but it suffices. I like how you have the option to put extra mayonnaise or bonito flakes for an additional charge. I envy the students from NYU or those who work around Otafuku because I'd definitely have this for lunch often!I'm going to keep coming back for more and perhaps try their taiyaki.
Adam R.}Manhattan, NY}0}11}2}-1}2}7/31/2015}Food here is passable but hair in my food is unacceptable. One hair in your food and you give them the benefit of the doubt. Two hairs and I'm starting to get disgusted. I counted four hairs from at least two culprits before I couldn't dig around anymore without throwing up a bit in my mouth. They get two stars because the last time I came here the food was good, unfortunately for them I won't be coming back a 3rd time.
Paula V.}Westchester County, NY}2}10}7}-1}4}7/29/2015}I've had Takoyaki balls in other parts of the world. Couldn't say that this is the best I've ever had; I personally feel that the bonito flakes is a little excessive and I would love to see a little more dried nori on top. Delicious nonetheless! I always stop by whenever I'm in the area.
Riri C.}Manhattan, NY}0}69}0}-1}4}7/28/2015}They moved to a bigger storefront nearby! This place is great, I love the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo. Only thing is, there aren't seats and depending on the time/day, there can be quite a lot of people waiting.
SeungAh Y.}Jersey City, NJ}4}5}2}-1}1}7/24/2015}Firstly I posted review here but I got a message plz erase my post cause mine is too short.anyway I wanna say that this shop is not good.I saw this shop on the internet but I am really disappointed. my friend also said it is waste his money. Cash only.he ordered nutella fish bread?? I don't know the exact name but i think it is nutella banana bread. smell is really nice but not enough nutella and banana in it. so I can just taste bread but even bread is not tasty. I ordered match icecream and it is also bad. the price is not that cheap. I mean the price is okay but compare to the taste i think it is kind of waste my money. I and my friend is really disappointed so we tried other gelato shop called fresco. very nice. much better than here!
Amber R.}Brooklyn, NY}76}67}54}-1}2}7/20/2015}I'm pretty disappointed in the new Otafuku. I don't know if Medetai is its own entity that just partnered up with Otafuku, but my experiences at the new place have been subpar at best. Prepare yourselves for a huge whining session that involves comparing the old location with the new.The few times I've went to this new place, I've usually purchased the okonomi combo-- either the one with yakisoba, or the takoyaki. I agree with some of the more recent reviews that say that it's lacking... the takoyaki is a bit pricey and then doesn't have much filling or flavor at all, especially compared to all the other places in the area. The okonomiyaki is the same, plus they make the pancakes smaller than before (where before they pretty much made it freestyle, now they use bowls or whatever to make it a certain size).. I don't know what the standardized recipe is, but the old one was much better, the seasoning was in that thing. I believe the old place used to put the red ginger INTO the pancake too. The okonomi is still kind of distinct compared to the other places in the area that makes it, but in my opinion is not worth the money they charge.As far as the "medetai"/taiyaki, sometimes it's a hit or miss. I do love the traditional red bean and I like how they have a special flavor to choose from too-- but sometimes it's a hit or miss. Sometimes it's perfect, sometimes they don't use enough batter for the 'fish' and it ends up starting to crumble a bit on me (with the hot filling inside)-- other times it seems like they either skimped out on the fillings, or they put too much dough that there's not a real balance.As far as service, it is extremely slow, and I don't understand why... they have more staff working on food than the old spot (where it was literally one person cooking). I do feel like I wait an awful lot for my food. And like other Yelpers, there have been times where I watched people who walked in after me get their food -before- me, which I think is really unfair. I've also been that person who got one part of my combo fresh made while the other one has been sitting around for a bit....I do not understand the increase in the food prices (even if it's just a dollar or two) when the taste has gone down, I'm being given a bit less, and I have to wait a long time for a long time. They've also added tax to the food if I remember correctly (aren't you only supposed to tax for people staying in? or is that just for the jobs I worked at?), and then they charge you if you want more okonomi sauce or more mayo and stuff. Like lol what excuse me?I'll likely still eat here, but until they kind of shape back to how they used to be, I'll always be somewhat bitter about it all. I miss the old Japanese staff that were really urban and worked in that hole-in-the-wall blasting Japanese reggae mixes and stuff..... like really casual and I guess more "Kansai" in attitude and were also able to put out food just as quickly with just 2 staff and really flavor their food the right way. No extra charge for more sauces or anything like that. But until I either find another place that makes their okonomi just as bomb as Otafuku's used to be, or I find one of those old Kansai-type boys to be my personal chef, I guess I'll have to settle for the new place and grumble my way through it..
Hak Bin A.}Forest Hills, NY}355}42}131}-1}2}7/15/2015}Takoyaki was decent not bad and line wait time was average... I had better so nothing to Rave about but A bit disappointed as the price of $7 for 6 Takoyaki needed more Octopus or 2 more balls in my opinion...As for the Takoyaki  I could only taste the sauce mayo, brown sauce and the fish flakes... The batter was flavorless and just salty...
Henry T.}New York, NY}279}539}1779}18}3}7/13/2015}I remember when this place was a hole-in-the-wall down the block from where it currently is. That place literally couldn't even fit more than 4 customers or else it would be a safety hazard. They then moved to where they are currently which has a bigger area and even standing room to eat at. The quality and price of food has also changed ever since they've moved.What makes this place famous is for their takiyaki ball (Squid balls) made fresh with their homemade batter. They also offer noodle (yakisoba) and takyaki (sweet fish pastry filled with red bean paste). Ever since moving, the prices has risen and the quality of food has since deteriorated. Would I come back? Maybe once in a blue moon.
Jie S.}New York, NY}63}18}6}-1}3}7/13/2015}The yakisoba is not so good, the okonomiyaki is excellent. Takoyaki is good. This place should be serving fast food, but our food comes really slow. Not a big fan but would take friends from other states for Japanese street food sometimes.
Kev Y.}New York, NY}72}12}0}-1}3}7/13/2015}Big Fan of there Takoyaki, but I feel like it's not as good as they use to make them.
Sharon N.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}0}19}1}-1}1}7/11/2015}Just paid $3 for a green tea mini soft serve, I thought they would at least put it in the small parfait bowl but they managed to find an even smaller plastic cup and literally gave me 3 tablespoons of ice cream. NEVER coming back here. Go one block away to Sundaes and Cones.
Noa B.}New York, NY}499}210}694}-1}1}7/10/2015}I did not have a good experience here by any means. I got combo a which comes with takoyaki and okonomiyaki which you can choose pork or shrimp (I got shrimp). About 10 minutes after I ordered a couple came in and ordered both combo a and combo b. While I know that combo b is different and possibly takes less time to make, they got their whole order before me which had the same combo as I got. A few more people came in and all of them got their food before me. I waited for about 45 minutes until I got my food. The wait was seriously not worth it. Both items had so much sauce on it and the teriyaki sauce was way too sweet and over powered everything. The pancake was the better of the two because I was able to take off most of the sauce but still not worth the wait. Overall the food wasn't good and the wait was unreasonable. Maybe if the food was better it could somehow be justified by the long  wait but it wasn't and I definitely won't be back and I would suggest avoiding this place.
Ferdinand C.}Bronx, NY}46}192}4}18}3}7/8/2015}Cash onlyWe we're running short on time so we only ordered the takoyaki. There isn't really a sitting area for many ppl so be prepared to stand around outside and eat the food outside or stand inside where the counters are. Maybe the flour inside the squidballs weren't cooked enough but I got a stomach ache right after eating them. I think if it weren't for the stomach ache it would've been a great experience. The squid inside the takoyaki is very minimal too. It's mostly all carbs and seasoning. Despite all this I want to go back and try their okonomiyaki.
Deirdre L.}Brooklyn, NY}293}441}143}18}4}7/7/2015}Im a big fan of their okinamiyaki..It was delicious! Get the pork one---its with bacon! Yum! I still think about it.The takoyaki is good, but I am not a big fan of it in general.Great if you would like to take out, as there is no where to sit
Dylan Q.}New York, NY}380}8}1}-1}3}7/7/2015}This place used to be a small dinky hole in the wall on 2nd Ave, but now that it's moved into its new digs on 9th St, it's become nicer inside, but also more pricey. I loved the old place, perfect for a late night snack, but now, the former employees seem to be all gone, and I always get the feeling it's just too expensive for a snack food. Loved the old place, not as much the new.
Demian H.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}1}4}0}-1}2}7/7/2015}It is not pleasant for me to give low score for this place because their takoyaki is still the best in NYC.  But having great food is only a part of the dining experience in my view and this place lacks horribly in every other aspects.  First of all, their famed takoyaki sure tastes great, but only when it is served fresh, right off the grill.  Apparently, even their employees today confirmed that this is rarely done.  Instead, they pre-cook their takoyaki well in advance and keep it in their shelf before being served to customers.  This makes the takoyaki soggy and mushy and basically taste like shit that is disintegrating under hot weather.  This is obviously not what I come here for.  What makes this worse is the attitude of the employees.  When I complained that I was expecting fresh takoyaki, the lady in the front was visibly annoyed and instead blamed me that I did not make that clear when I ordered.  She then when on to say that they RARELY serve takoyaki fresh and they are all pre-made, as if I am the idiot to expect it fresh in the first place.  Are you kidding me?  Also the ventilation in this tiny hole was terrible and I was suffocating but I had a hell of a time trying to get them to keep the door open to let some air in.  I realize that it is unfair to expect 5 star service in a joint that is primarily take-out based.  However, even for a place like this, some basic level of courtesy and service goes a long way.  Yes, the place does typically have a long line of people waiting and the employees are probably over-worked, but they do not have to be so rough and make it so obvious that they hate their jobs and their customers.  My guess is that the owner of this place does not give a shit about how his place is run and that is rubbing off on the employees.  Maybe the owner is so confident that people will still come anyway.  My guess is that, sooner or later, enough people will be pissed off to make a dent in the business.  Sooner or later, someone will figure out that this takoyaki is actually not that difficult to make and open up another joint that is actually well run, giving New Yorkers much better option.  In the meanwhile, if you ever make a quick visit, be sure to ask in advance that you want all your orders to be fresh and right off the grill.  Accept nothing from the shelf.
Elaine W.}New York, NY}299}264}26}-1}4}7/7/2015}If you're like me and sometimes say "takoyaki" and "taiyaki" interchangeably to the chagrin of my non-existent Japanese friends, then this place just MIGHT have you sputtering the wrong order: they have both!Takoyaki (octopus balls) has been Otafuku's staple for eons. While you will probably find better takoyaki in Asia, you cannot go wrong with Otafuku's, especially after a few drinks (it's that kind of food!). Believe it or not, I used to crave octopus balls in college (fancy tastebuds) since it was so satisfying and affordable and would make the 30 min trip down here in pouring rain. If you never tried takoyaki before, it's worth a try! You can watch the bonito flakes dancing on the hot octopus balls--don't worry, everything is dead.Taiyaki is the fish-shaped "pancake" (for lack of a better word) usually filled with red beans. It's another favorite Japanese street snack. I've only had the green tea parfait here, which comes with two small pieces of taiyaki without the red bean filling. As far as I can tell, the taiyaki is served hot and crisp, as it should be. As for the parfait, eh--the green tea flavor is not as intense as I would've liked.Even if you are a super food snob like me, it's hard to not love Otafuku. It's an East Village staple in my mind. Always satisfying.
Laura G.}New York, NY}148}172}32}18}3}7/3/2015}I think it's nice that Otafuku only specializes in a couple of items- it makes decisions easy and it means they must make those items really well! Unfortunately they do not really have any vegetarian options. The server told me, however, that I could order their $9 okonomiyaki just without pork or shrimp. That's nice but I didn't feel like spending $9 on one at that time, plus it looked super huge and rich and filling. I got a chocolate nutella medetai. Upon ordering, the server said, "It's not ready yet. Can you wait 12 minutes?" That's a long time to wait and if I hadn't really wanted one, they'd have lost my business. I ended up going someplace for a bit then coming back. The medetai itself was the perfect size and a very reasonable price. There was not enough nutella in it. There is a big bench outside and a standing bar on the inside, but this place is too small unfortunately to accommodate seating.
Karin Y.}Pittsburgh, PA}224}57}82}-1}4}6/27/2015}OMG I love this place!! There are absolutely NO good takoyaki or okonomiyaki places in Boston--I only get to eat it when my parents make it at home, which is rare :'( or when I go to Japan (even more rare). So after discovering this place in late December, I make it a point to visit here everytime I'm in NYC. They make the takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and yakisoba fresh so that when you get your order, it's steaming hot!! I burnt my tongue while eating the takoyaki, but it was sooo good so I didn't even care. The batter inside was yummy, and the outside was so soft (I hate it when it's hard and sort of crispy on the outside--it's weird. Unfortunately, the takoyaki at restaurants in Boston are like that :( ). The only thing I might request next time at Otafuku is for less sauce on top -- personally, I only like a little bit of the bulldog sauce and mayonnaise, and enjoy the batter taste inside. Not a sit-down place, but if you find a spot on the counter you can stand and finish your food there. Be prepared to wait a little bit. CASH ONLY!
Yaran S.}Pittsfield, MA}132}247}1261}18}2}6/22/2015}This is a small place with only two benches outdoor. I had combo B which includes 6 takoyaki and one piece of okonomiyaki for $12. The okonomiyaki was basically a pancake full of cabbage with very few tinny shrimps. Takoyaki was huge but again, very little octopus inside. I felt like eating a meal full of dough and cabbage and nothing else. The price is quite high given the quality of food. It worth a try but I do not recommend this place. It lacks of service too. Waited ten minutes for the combo.
Mr F G And Ms M S.}Flushing, NY}668}1041}4009}-1}4}6/21/2015}We stopped by here on a Sunday night after dinner. We tried their takoyaki when they were still at their old location & it was really good, This time we didn't get the takoyaki because we were full from eating dinner. We got the red bean medetai. It was good. It's $3.27 with tax & it was worth it. Definitely worth stopping by.
Lauren T.}New York, NY}469}149}620}-1}2}6/16/2015}Thinking this would be a quick in-then-out Takoyaki purchase, the wait time ended up being much longer than we expected. Overall the Takoyaki was sub-par at best.Note: This place is cash only!
Giselle A.}New York, NY}38}12}2}-1}5}6/14/2015}A little pricey so I recommend the combos! It's a good way to treat yourself with yummy takoyaki and chocolate medetai every now and then. The okonomiyaki is good but I feel like it falls a little flat with all the cabbage. I still get it anyway.
Bewen X.}Brooklyn, NY}50}36}66}-1}3}6/13/2015}I thought the squid roll and the pork cabbage was going to be so much better. The sauce over powers the food and got very nauseating. The onion on the top tasted like paper. The service was very good. The workers are super friendly. It takes about 10-12 minutes for the food to be made.
Lisa G.}Poway, San Diego, CA}860}430}3669}18}5}6/11/2015}THEIR TAKOYAKI IS AMAZING. I had originally looked this place on yelp and google - and this one came out to be the top result for good takoyaki in the city.I had had takoyaki before a few times in Flushing Mall before it closed down and it was okay. But I had found my new fix after going here! Well when I was still in New York that is. They make it fresh in front of you and also sell the Japanese red bean fish dessert as well. The takoyaki though, is really good. So if you ever go to Manhattan and crace some takoyaki, this is your place to go! Its not far from St. Marks at all!
Ani Y.}Manhattan, NY}4}245}34}-1}4}6/5/2015}I've been coming to otafuku since it's old spot down the block. Its takoyaki and okonomiyakis are spectacular. Their medetai not so much. The outside is lacking, usually cold (ordered it more than once and each time disappointing), and just not right. Definitely not even close to what I've had in Japan. But their takoyaki and okonomiyaki is pretty spot on (though honestly have gone down a bit in quality lately). Definitely stuck between a three or a four star rating for me.
Billie W.}Brooklyn, NY}323}29}63}-1}3}6/3/2015}This is a cute place. The line wasn't long at all (did go on a rainy day though), and it didn't take long at all to order. I got the nutella banana Medetai for $3.27 (including tax), and it was solidly OK. Nothing great, nothing awful either. The dough was rather disappointing as it didn't have any particularly spectacular flavor or nice oven-fresh smell, but it was an acceptable snack. I appreciated the packaging though - they got that part together pretty well.
Annie L.}Philadelphia, PA}342}31}55}-1}3}6/1/2015}I only ordered the medetai/taiyaki (fish dessert), and it was ok... I wished it was bigger though and had more options for flavors. When I went, you could only get red bean or hazelnut chocolate & banana. Green tea cream would go very well with the fish waffle. Besides the lack of variety, the taste was pretty solid; standard batter and filling. I also wished there was seating in the restaurant. It was raining the day I went, and it would have been nice to sit down and enjoy my food.
Jenny C.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}121}281}359}18}4}5/31/2015}Such a fun place! I ordered the Combo A which consists of takoyaki (6 pieces) and medetai (taiyaki) for $9.50 plus tax. I have to say, I was kind of thrown off when they added tax but whatever... You can eat outside the storefront where there are two benches reserved for the customers or stand inside where there is a counter to eat at, though space is quite limited.The takoyaki were delicious. It came out pipin' hot and perfectly ooey and gooey on the inside. The sauces on top and the bonito flakes were simply exquisite. We chose the taiyaki with red bean filling, but you also have a choice of nutella with bananas if red-bean isn't your thing. The red bean filling was sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet. It went very well with the cake itself which is more plain in taste. I would've preferred the outer part of the taiyaki to have some sort of a sweet glaze on top which I had seen in some parts of Japan. Plus, I was bummed that the fish outline of my taiyaki was not as pronounced as I would've liked it to be. Silly I know, but looking at the fish shape is one of the reasons why I like eating taiyakis so much - I think it is so cute! Haha.Overall, I really enjoyed the food here and would love to come back and try the okonomiyaki as well.
Nancy P.}New York, NY}364}585}233}18}3}5/26/2015}I remember coming to Otafuku for some late night takoyaki eats.  It must have been ages ago because when I went recently, the place definitely did not look like that.  The place is now a bit more spacious on the inside.  It's still cash only though.  There were two benches outside to sit.We ordered some takoyaki and ended up outside with six balls.  The octopus was a bit chewy on the inside.  The dough was mushy and super saucy.  They made me really thirsty after eating just one.It's fun watching them make the balls and the fish red bean sandwiches.
Andrew S.}West Hollywood, CA}670}647}108}18}2}5/17/2015}We waited a long time to get our Takoyaki.  We stood in line, ordered, paid and waited probably 15 minutes.  Strike one... I guess at around 8pm at night tehrewere a lot of deliveries... ... and I don't know why.  Couple the long wait with the over-sauced nature of what I was served, and I just did not enjoy what I ate. Strike two.I have had much better in Tokyo, in Honolulu and in LA.  Strike three, relativism. I am not impressed and think this place is a bit overhyped.
Abeda A.}Buffalo, NY}358}12}0}-1}4}5/17/2015}It's okay for the price and for it's location. ***Caution*** Does not take Credit CardsI basically ordered a combo of  Takoyaki and Shrimp Yakisoba to take to a dance competition at Tompkins Square Park. There isn't any place to sit inside this venue, only a bench which seats either 2 or 3 people outside. (Usually a couple takes up the bench so you might as well walk somewhere else for seating) The venue is pretty small so I don't know how they can add additional seating either outside or inside so I guess we have to deal with this.My total was $15 and the food was  yummy. If you don't know already, Takoyaki are balls full of creamy batter and octopus. They were really hot so take caution before scorching your throat! The Takoyaki served here are pretty large and incredibly soft to eat. Usually, I have small chewy Takoyaki, but these are pretty light and fluffy. The Yakisoba... is okay. I felt that it was nothing too special. It looked all garnished up but the taste was okay. Almost like Lo Mein. The wait time varies honestly. When I went there was only two people in front of me ordering but about 15 people waiting for their food after ordering. I could say it took a good 20 minutes for me to receive my food.I would come back for a little snack while roaming the East Village area, but definitely not for a meal. However, this does not stop the food from being pretty good.
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}3}5/16/2015}Many years ago one cold night, young me went along with a couple of good friends to the old location of Otafuku. Back then, they only had one bench outside, not two. There was only enough space for two or three people to order inside, and then you would immediately go outside to wait for your delicious goodies. They came out hot, fresh off the grill from this hole-in-the-wall place. I've wanted to come back ever since, and being tempted with the newly-renovated location, I brought some new old friends here. Now there's enough room for maybe 10 people to stand inside while waiting, and there are two benches outside. Now there are drinks on shelves for you to choose from. But it ain't the same no mo.The takoyaki (octopus balls) were mainly dough and the octopus chewy. Yakisoba was okay. The fish pancake sandwich is cute but rather bland. The only consolation was the bottled drink, Bikkle, but they didn't really make that. This visit made me think, was it always like this and I just didn't know better back then? Has my memory failed me?
Celine L.}Los Angeles, CA}2989}901}4625}-1}4}5/6/2015}Stopped by to try their takoyaki! The balls weren't made fresh to order so we received it quickly. However, it was still extremely hot so we exercised caution as we ate the takoyaki. The takoyaki itself was larger than the normal size, and filled with batter. The ingredients were there, but we wished it was made fresh. It was definitely yummy- the octopus was a great contrast to batter and the flavors were great, but you can tell that it had been sitting there for awhile and just heated. All in all, a great place to stop by for Japanese snacks!
George C.}New York, NY}0}7757}14306}-1}3}5/5/2015}Grubhub pickup for Combo B with Shrimp Okonomiyaki $11.00 Takoyaki and one piece of okonomiyaki for $11.98. Brusque Asian manager-type was the first person who's even sternly demanded ID for an order pickup. Most bizarre east village hours of all time: opens @ 12 but no online orders until 1, closed Friday and Saturday. Enjoyed both items, but don't see myself coming back, especially for the price.PS Technically Otafuku [x Medetai] now.
J A.}Manhattan, NY}0}18}9}-1}4}5/2/2015}A take-out place with a limited number of selections. (I personally like places with just a few items on the menu -- tends to be better food, because of the specialization!) I went there for the okonomiyaki/yakisoba combo platter. It was inexpensive and great! I would recommend the place and definitely return, based on my non-expert love of okonomiyaki and yaki soba noodles.
Liz C.}Manhattan, NY}225}486}35}18}5}4/20/2015}*** Review on okonomiyaki *** First, like many of the other reviewers have mentioned, it's cash only. This review focuses mainly on how phenomenally delicious their okonomiyaki is. However, I did also try their red bean medetai (which is good, but I wished it was sweeter). Anyways, the okonomiyaki is a very popular item and for good reason too. It is delicious and well priced. The batches are made fresh so you'll have to wait a couple minutes for it. Very filling and you have the option to purchase a combo set if you're really hungry. There isn't a place to sit down unless you sit outside on the bench. Highly recommend coming here and I definitely plan to make a visit back!
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}123}31}469}-1}1}4/20/2015}Salivating and waiting for our combo#3 (yakisoba and takoyaki) we saw the cashier handle our food. Gross!! I notified the lady (cashier at the time) that the guy didn't change his gloves. She asked him and said he washed his hands, however he should've taken the gloves off since he handled money with them on. I asked the lady discretely and politely if we could get a refund. She argued and denied everything I told her. I didn't want to make a scene but she was so disrespectful and only offered a refund for the takoyaki since he didn't use his hands to make the yakisoba. He eventually apologized and said it was his fault and admitted to not washing his hands. I got my full refund. Never again.  We were so upset and wanted to leave our medetai at the counter. W ended up throwing it away as soon as we walked out the door. Hard as a rock.
Willie R.}Washington, DC}94}352}519}18}3}4/19/2015}This was the first time I had okonomiyaki, and I'm definitely down for seconds. This review exclusively covers that dish. I found it refreshing that Otafuku offers this all-vegetarian option, as I'm allergic to the seafood items, like takoyaki, that comprise the lion's share of their menu. I visited Otafuku with a food tour group and was pleased by the okonomiyaki, which was hot, fresh, and unexpectedly complex. I skipped the dried fish flake(dashi)  topping due to my allergy, but my companions raved about them as an addition. I'd happily go back here to try their dishes.
Kristen T.}Manhattan, NY}4}19}9}-1}1}4/18/2015}It's supposed to close at 11. On a Saturday night, we were about to enter at 10:44, after rushing to get in time but the lady said they were closing and even if we insisted she refused. Not cool!
Lauren H.}New York, NY}318}153}838}-1}3}4/15/2015}***CASH ONLY***So my father actually recommended this place to me after reading an article somewhere. Last week I was like hey! let's try Otafuku, it's supposed to serve really good authentic Japanese street food.Was not impressed by their food to be honest.Yep, it's a hole in the wall, nothing wrong with that, just be prepared to stand or sit outside on the benches if you're staying to eat. We ordered the Combo C: Takoyaki & Yakisoba for $14.50 - serves six grilled octopus balls with Bonito flakes on top, and yakisoba noodles with cabbage and some pickled ginger. Portions are definitely on the larger side so that's a plus if you want to share.It was eh.... the taste was a little off to me. I wasn't expecting to taste sour when eating my noodles, but it was still OK to eat, and the Takoyaki batter was undercooked, not to mention there was only one little piece of octopus inside (it was like a mouthful of unsweetened pancake batter), but maybe that's the way they're traditionally made. It definitely didn't sit well in my stomach.If you're into traditional Japanese street food, this probably will be a 4-5 star for you. I'd maybe give it another go and order something else, but by all means am I in no rush.
Kevin E.}Brooklyn, NY}81}544}817}18}2}4/11/2015}Maybe it's just a matter of preference but I did not enjoy Otafuku as much as I would've liked to. I came here at an off time but it still took them a long time to make my Combo B (takoyaki and okonomiyaki). It's a very small establishment and if you want to eat in there, you would have to stand and eat at the counter. Service is nice but kind of slow.Takoyaki- I liked the sauce (even though it was kind of salty) and it actually reminded me of the sauce that was drizzled on my Omu Soba from Mew Izakaya which I loved! But that's about it. The octopus inside, although very tasty, was very small and I did not like the batter either (again, mainly a matter of preference).Pork okonomiyaki- A cabbage pancake with bacon on top. The batter that they used to hold the cabbage together reminded me of cooking sprays which really grossed me out...Overall, it was really bland except for the bacon on top which added some flavor to the okonomiyaki.For people who like these kinds of Japanese street foods, this would probably be a good place to try out. But for me, I did not like the takoyaki batter or the okonomiyaki in general. $11.50 for this combo though which isn't exactly cheap. Probably won't be back :(
Vivian N.}New York, NY}1}16}251}-1}3}4/8/2015}We've waited for so long for only 1 combo, just because the staff kept on talking. However, to be honest, the quality of the Takoyaki & Okonomiyaki are good as usual, but the Taiyaki ( Very Berry Choco ) wasn't good as expected.
Gabe W.}Brooklyn, NY}202}112}73}-1}2}4/5/2015}Not authentic, slightly disgusting and overpriced. Can definitely understand since this isn't Osaka, but just a gimmick advertising an authentic experience that one simply can't replicate.
Dex Y.}Manhattan, NY}19}292}0}-1}3}4/5/2015}The takoyaki was alright but didn't impress. The ball was a little too soft and not chewy enough. The sauce had a salty and sour taste, and didn't enhance the flavor much. Overall an Ok Japanese comfort food place to stop by but not worth a detour.
Pam K.}Denver, CO}37}153}33}-1}4}4/1/2015}My friends have raved about Otafuku for as long as I could remember, but since it was cash only and I was never in that area, I never went. When I found out that they moved down the block to a bigger space, I thought, "this is my chance!!" but apparently, that didn't happen. Until now.My friend and I came to Otafuku after countless conversations of telling me to "love myself" and I was surprised at how small the "new" location was. This location is apparently slightly bigger than the previous one (which was just a hole in the wall stand), with some standing room for patrons to consume takoyaki and okonomiyaki, among other Japanese goodies. All of my friends have said that Otafuku is the ONLY place to get delicious takoyaki and okonomiyaki, but after reading some of the Yelp reviews, I was unconvinced. Can this place really be the place of my fried octopus dreams?When my friend and I came, I ended up ordering a Combo B (I believe), which was one piece of okonomiyaki and takoyaki. Ordering here is extremely horrendous, since there isn't very much space to stand and the wait time is extremely long. I guess its cool to see how everything is being made, but, for the love of all things fried, please streamline this process somehow. I don't know how many more times I can take waiting more than 20 minutes for my food.After getting my food (which was pleasantly heavier than I expected), my friend and I walked to the open space near Cooper Union to eat. I was really happy that my food was hot and fresh (since some Yelp reviews said otherwise) and that both the takoyaki and okonomiyaki were slathered in bonito flakes and sauce. I personally thought that the takoyaki was flavorful and delicious, and that there was a nice balance of batter and octopus. I know that other takoyaki that I've tried had too much batter and too little octopus, so it was more like eating fried batter more than anything. I don't know if I would say that Otafuku has the BEST takoyaki, but it was definitely better than a lot of other places I've tried. I also think that the okonomiyaki was very filling, despite its small appearance. I think that there was a nice balance of shrimp and cabbage and sauce, which made for a very enjoyable eating experience.Overall, I would give this place a 4/5 because personally, if you don't get a combo, I think that the food to price ratio is a little too low for me.
Andrey T.}Brooklyn, NY}5}24}48}-1}4}3/29/2015}Came here with my sister after my interview and we decided to buy takoyaki because I had never tasted one and my sister hadn't had one in a long time. This place is small, so you'll have to either go there early or find a place to sit elsewhere. The takoyaki was good, but I don't like it. The medetai, however, was amazing! I had the red bean one and it was so warm and tasty. I would definitely go back again, only for the medetai though !
Sophia K.}Flushing, NY}0}9}5}-1}2}3/17/2015}I'm currently studying hospitality, and I've noticed that their sanitation was very disappointing. I was able to see the kitchen through the window, and I saw a cashier who also handles foods was eating pizza in the kitchen. I was disgusted. Also, their customer service was really very bad.  I ordered a combo ( takoyaki and okonomiyaki ). I had to wait for 30 minutes because they gave my food to the other customer by mistake. (Although I told them ahead of time that I didn't get my food.) I was totally fine with it. However, when I told the cashier that I've waited for my food for 30 minutes outside when it's windy, she said, "You actually waited 25 minutes." I was extremely angry when I heard that because she said it with rudeness, and she did not even apologized to me. If she apologized and made an effort to give satisfaction, I wouldn't even write this review on yelp. Because they were rushing to cook, the food was not even that good.I am very disappointed and disgusted of the way they serve food and their behavior. (It was actually the cashier who was being rude. The other two workers were fine, but they also didn't apologized.)I do not recommend this place, unless you want to be served from a food handler who did not seem educated.
Jon S.}Brooklyn, NY}123}642}1}18}5}3/16/2015}Clearly Otafuku didn't think seating was much of a priority when it came to upgrading space over a year ago. Because even though the skinny, slightly shabby workplace has been replaced by a less skinny and shiny counter, there are still only a handful of places to eat. Come when the weather is warm or try desperately to grab the couple of counter spaces that are available.It will be a challenge as the student and Japanese-set certainly knows about this barely-kept East Village, which has been turning out made to order okonomiyaki and takoyaki for years for now. They always are fresh, hearty and extremely satisfying, and I've always appreciated the ability to get them without committing to a whole sit down meal. I wish this restaurant was on the way to more places (can they open a branch underneath my office?).As for the new menu additions that came with the new place, I'm not much of a sweet person, so the fish-shaped taiyaki wasn't much of a draw, neither were the expanded selection of Japanese sodas and beverages that take up the back corner (perhaps this could have been used for more seating).The crowds have swelled at this location and they don't seem to have made the same investment in making sure it can move faster. Perhaps adding credit card support or more capacity would help, but either way I'm sure I'll keep waiting in line for those pancakes and octopus balls.
Cindy L.}New York, NY}119}333}728}-1}3}3/15/2015}FoodTakoyaki: 3/5 Super salty. Interesting texture. I expected more from it because this is what they are known for but it's just meh.Matcha Medetai: 3/5 Disappointing. I expected more from it because it was part of their New Year Special. There was absolutely no matcha flavor whatsoever. There was these chewy things, possibly rice cake, at the top and the bottom and then red bean filling in the center. That was the only thing good about it.Red Bean Medetai: 4/5 My favorite of all the medetai. Strong flavor, a little too strong but I can at least taste the flavor unlike the other two.Nutella & Banana Medetai: 2/5 Also very disappointing. I expected strong chocolaty flavor but there was none whatsoever. Super bland. I can taste some of the banana in it but that's about it.Experience- Get super crowded on the weekend.- On days that they are crowded, mostly weekends, you can expect your food to be prepared in advance or done halfheartedly. They gave me two medetai with indistinguishable features when I stopped by today. - Unpleasant service. Been here three times and I only got decent service once. - The lady in charge of the register and a guy cooking was too busy flirting with each other and not tending to the crowd of people waiting to get their orders taken. Highly unprofessional! - The only available seating is outside and that's pretty inconvenient in the cold weather.- Decent food. - Overall, not a place I will come back to.
Evelyn W.}Manhattan, NY}362}237}363}-1}4}3/15/2015}The takoyaki here never disappoints! I usually come here for Combo A, takoyaki with a medetai. Last night I was here and the wait was a bit longer than if you come at off-peak times, but it was worth the wait! My red bean medetai was a tad dry, I would definitely suggest ordering it with the mochi balls. My sister had the matcha medetai and loved it (hers HAD the mochi balls in it). Great for a quick snack while hanging out on the Lower East Side! This place is cash only and has no seats, just a counter. Definitely a eat and run kind of place and please, for heaven's sake... don't bring your strollers in here!!
Wenting T.}Manhattan, NY}2}14}0}-1}4}3/12/2015}The takoyaki is basically authentic, but I would expect it to be a little bit hotter from the grill and melting, like the ones I had back home.
Laura P.}New York, NY}82}136}45}-1}5}3/8/2015}The wait/cooking time is 20 mins for the okonomiyaki. So just be careful about ordering it. The takoyaki is awesome. Now that I know how long it takes to get the okonmiyaki (it's not that great imo), I will probably only ever come to get takoyaki. It's really freaking good.Seems like it's common to be quite rude in the area. I stood to the side so the ordering area was clear because my order was done. I was picking out my utensils and this girl says excuse me with an attitude. I moved way over to the takoyaki station, but no one took her order because guess what? They were packing my order to give to me. She had to wait and move so I can grab it anyways!
Al L.}Toronto, Canada}980}856}970}-1}3}3/7/2015}Small place serving decent japanese food. Their takoyaki was pretty good, but their okonomiyaki was a bit sub par for me. Not sure what it was, but wasn't that tasty. Their combo for $11 is a pretty good deal in NYC. There is a bit of a wait, which if youre seeing it as glass half full means youre getting a fresh batch.
Ken T.}San Francisco, CA}276}288}843}-1}4}3/5/2015}Came here on a rainy night an hour before closing. It looked like they were almost getting ready to close. From the time I ordered and ate there they had only 1 other customer. I ordered a combo, an order of takoyaki and an order of okonomiyaki, $11. Both were already pre-made, so service was quite fast. Other times you can see them make em in big batches. It comes with 6 very large takoyakis. They were the biggest I've ever seen but when I bit into one it was very airy and not dense like what I'm used to. The okonomiyaki was my favorite, just a bit of batter and lots of cabbage, yummy. Both came with a good amount of sauces and a lot of bonito flakes, my favorite. I couldn't finish it all and the okonomiyaki still tasted good a day later, while the takoyaki didn't.
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}3}3/3/2015}I finally ate here!!!! I finally got my little big green tea fish!!!!!!! With red bean and mochi inside!!!!!I liked it! Tons! When I went the people working made it fresh on the spot. So when I had a bite it was nice and hot!One thing I got to say is: you guys gotta add more red bean, so basically when I bit the fishie this is what fillings I got: nothing, mochi, red bean, mochi, red bean, nothing.It should be more like : red bean, mochi & red bean, red bean, mochi and red bean, red bean. DONE!Consistency is key! I felt like my fishie had empty places (mochi) and really good places(red bean). So, that's the only thing I had to mention, one thing i loved was that you can actually taste the green tea. MHMM!!! You heard meee!Anyways, I'll add my final review when I go to try the takoyaki.See yaas.
Cristina C.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}6}32}0}-1}5}3/1/2015}Otafuku is my shit! I'm a huge fan of okonomiyaki and I love theirs. It's big (you get two of them!), full of cabbage, and not too heavy on the sauce or extra flavorings. If you do like it drenched in sauce you can get extra (I think for a small fee). I also love takoyaki (I just love everything they have here), and if you get the combo with the takoyaki and okonomiyaki, it's very reasonably priced for the portion and enough to share with a friend. Unless you're really hungry and competitive with food. Then get your own, you jerk.I also had the chocolate banana medetai one time and it was tasty as expected. Never tried the red bean because I have issues with red bean paste, but I'd expect it's good if you're a fan!I love how they make everything fresh and right in front of you. Sometimes there's a wait but it's so worth it since I know it's not old food that's been sitting there forever, and I enjoy watching them make it. There's no seating but if you're lucky you can find a spot on the bench right outside. I'd try to go on a nice day and eat outside in one of the public areas nearby.The drinks are kinda pricy and the selection is limited, but they do have a lemon yuzu one that I'm addicted to. However usually I prefer to go to a different store nearby and get my drinks there since I'm eating outside anyway!
Annie P.}Brooklyn, NY}1}16}43}-1}4}2/28/2015}Purchased the fish deserts here and it amazed me on how they create it. However, we had to wait 15 mintues for it and the flavor can be beat from other places.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}3}2/28/2015}Medetai special ($4.90 w/ tax) - two small mochi (sticky rice balls) and red bean paste inside green tea dough as a fish pancake sandwich was not for me. The dough was too chewy and two other main ingredients in the fillings were okay. I've never had a regular kind, Taiyaki with red bean filling, there so I can not say about it but I am pretty sure it's not going to be so different. I definitely skip Taiyaki and try others like Okonomiyaki or Takoyaki that were the number one orders when I was waiting for my Medai special (wait is about 15 minutes) but during the wait, I was stuck in the small cramped room with a stiff air that was not fun. Even this cold weather, I will wait my order sitting on the bench outside.
Precious C.}New York, NY}211}66}20}-1}4}2/23/2015}The portions sizes for the Takoyaki were huge given it was only 7 bucks. I couldn't finish the entire thing.They didn't skimp on the squid flakes and the texture was a great balance of crunchy and soft. The inside of this restaurant definitely reminded me of Japan where you eat standing up with only a ledge..since it is fast food. Next time I'm trying the medetai.
Marsha N.}Middletown, CT}132}308}678}18}4}2/23/2015}I was so pumped when I saw that this place had takoyaki and okonomiyaki! From having lived in Japan, I know that there different styles of okonomiyaki much like we have different regional styles of pizza in America.I believe I like the Hiroshima style which has the ingredients layered rather than mixed. The layers are typically batter, cabbage, pork, and optional items such as squid, octopus, and cheese. Noodles (yakisoba, udon) are also used as a topping with fried egg and a generous amount of okonomiyaki sauce.The brown sauce must be some variation of hoisin sauce.The Kansai style of okonomiyaki is made of batter of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a savory pancake. I ordered a combo that had 6 takoyaki balls and one okonomiyaki. This ended up being too much food. I would have been happy with just the okonomiyaki pancake. I got the wasabi mayo as my specialty sauce. I didn't remember the cabbage being such a large percentage of the recipe. I loved it all the same but it wasn't how I remembered it.The takoyaki was very hot since they make it fresh in the round iron mold on the other side of the counter and you can watch it vibrate through the glass. The batter separated from the diced bit of octopus once I bit into it. I was happy to have the dancing bonito flakes again in my life. They also have meditai which is a dessert like cake with red bean paste "anko" inside it. I had to learn to like that while I was in Japan so I didn't opt to get it when I was in the shop. As a heads up, there are no seats inside just counter space.
Gabby S.}Brooklyn, NY}437}207}92}18}5}2/22/2015}This place is bomb . Although i really wish they had seating cause taking the food to go sucks sometimes .I always get the various combos The takoyaki is really good it has a good amount of octopus in it and the sauce is super good .I love the medetai it's so fluffy  and I don't have to go to mitsuwa to get it anymore.I recommend this place even more when the weather is warm cause you can sit on bench outside and enjoy
Steph S.}New York, NY}305}167}422}18}4}2/21/2015}I am writing this review based on the service & the taiyaki. I tried the takoyaki for the 1st time here but I have never had it before so I will write a review update once I try takoyaki at a different location. Taiyaki (Medetai?): There are 2 kinds, one with red bean & one with banana + nutella. I ordered a taiyaki with just plain nutella in it. I waited for a really long time for my taiyaki and the woman behind the counter saw this and gave me another red bean taiyaki for free which was extremely kind of her. The taiyaki is typical but I have had better taiyaki before with more filling and for less. But then again, I got one for free so I cannot complain. Takoyaki:as i said before I had never had this before. They look pretty cool and I am a big fan of octopus. They put fishy benito flakes on top and some kind of mayo sauce. I think next time I will order the takoyaki without the flakes or mayo because I am a typical American who likes starchy chewy things and I need to develop a taste for Japanese food.  But be careful to completely cool your takoyaki because it is super HOTThey have combo deals as well. Cons: no seating inside, cash only, there is only a bench outside to sit with a friend when the weather is warmPros: friendly staff, cute interior, can watch how the food is made Their seasonal desserts are cute.  I think they are running a promo on matcha taiyaki
Aime W.}Queens, NY}23}42}51}-1}2}2/20/2015}Not what it used to be.Otafuku used to have a tiny location down the street with a max-occupancy of around 3 people. With one guy on the other side of the counter making takoyaki and okonomiyaki, it was well worth the wait. It used to be my go-to spot for steaming hot, fresh takoyaki, enjoyed on the sidewalk outside.That's just not the case anymore. The new location is larger, with standing room and a larger area for them to cook, but my past two visits were just not up to par. The takoyaki is no longer fresh, but premade and left to sit under a heating lamp, and yet orders still take 15+ minutes till served. By then the takoyaki is barely hot, sometimes lukewarm.  The okonomiyaki is better since they make it fresh, but the shrimp are puny and might as well not be there.Lastly, I recently tried the Matcha Medetai, a fish shaped cake filled with red bean and mochi, it was horrible. They made it fresh and yet it wasn't crispy at all, tasted nothing of Matcha, and was like a tasteless soggy pancake.What happened Otafukuuu :(
Melissa S.}Albany, NY}62}76}64}-1}5}2/18/2015}OKONOMIYAKI! So delicious and really hits the spot. I also like the tako yaki and the red bean fish dessert thing... superb! I go there whenever I hit up the St. Marks area.
Alexander C.}New Haven, CT}2}19}0}-1}4}2/17/2015}Great Japanese street food although the price was a bit high for me. $14 for takoyaki and yakisoba isn't bad for New York though, and the food itself was good. Also make sure to check out their beverage section - I hadn't had Bikkle in years. There's also no seating inside, and we had to sit at the bench right outside, which was sort of a bummer. All in all a good place for fast food Japanese style.
Leila L.}Brooklyn, NY}123}422}720}-1}3}2/12/2015}This place moved from the original spot that was there for years.  This new spot is much cleaner and bigger.  you can actually stand indoors and eat your Takoyakis.  With this upgrade, there seems to be a downgrade in quality.  The balls are not what they used to be.  They seem to be pre-made and not as tasty.  The balls have a lot more flour and less octopus.  Also, the service is much slower.  It took us almost 15 minutes to receive our order even though we see the trays of balls inside the warmer the whole time we were standing there.  Sadly, takoyakis on 9th is just not what it used to be . . .
Delia M.}Brooklyn, NY}261}23}21}-1}5}2/7/2015}Takoyaki!!! That's what they're known for but everything on their menu is delicious. I usually get the combo because I can never decide on just getting one item. Their new place is bigger which is great for them.
Ina L.}New York, NY}3949}536}5489}18}3}2/5/2015}I don't know what the big deal is about Otafuku, to be honest. It is a hole-in-the-wall on a street that offers many other Japanese eating options.We decided to drop by for a Red Bean Medetai, which looks and tastes just like Korean Boonguh Bbang (Holler if you know what I'm referring to!!) They also had a handful of other items including the ever-so-popular Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki, but I wouldn't wait 5-6 minutes for the fresh batch like the others were. And not to my surprise, it was a cash-only establishment. I hate it when smaller stores pull this stunt because most often then not, it's for tax evasion purposes. And to aggravate the situation, Otafuku does not have an ATM machine. There aren't any tables or seats. So, if you do have cash and you do have the patience to wait 10-15 minutes for your food, you'll be standing next to NYU students while waiting for your food.
Yue L.}Northfield, MN}88}116}36}-1}5}2/4/2015}Delicious!Everything here is sooooo delicious! Yummy! The only down part is they don't offer chairs. Otherwise, highly recommend here
Khanh V.}Philadelphia, PA}103}296}909}-1}4}2/4/2015}I tried to make takoyaki at home with my boyfriend and it just isn't the same. Being an awesome boyfriend that he is, he took me here. And wow I love the takoyaki here. But not a fan of the oknomiyaki though. Too much veggies? Anyway if you're around the place, check it out.
Sarah K.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}425}265}25}-1}4}2/2/2015}This place is proof that there is still good in the world. My friends and I were craving takoyaki but didn't want to go to a sit down place. Otafuku serves up takoyaki like it should be - as a street food. We were able to grab some and go. It's cash only, but there's an ATM across the street, and a TD a block away. The menu is small but everything on there sounds amazing. They seem to want to push the combos more, and they do have a rewards/stamp card for them. They also offer some Asian drinks - the Asian pear juice they have is amazing! I only tried the takoyaki in terms of food - it was really good. It was airier than I like my takoyaki, and not as crisp, but it was filled generously with octopus, and topped with mayo, takoyaki sauce, and bonito flakes. It comes out ridiculously hot - be careful! I actually burned my mouth to the point of blisters because I tried wolfing each one down in one bite. Worth it.I love this place and wish there was one in every neighborhood.
Maheen M.}Monroe Township, NJ}347}204}824}-1}5}1/26/2015Updatedreview}Update: I came again because my of my friend. This time I made sure to ask for freshly made Takoyaki. Although I had to wait a lot more, it was worth it. The Takoyaki was phenomenal. I also ordered the shrimp okonomiyaki. It is very filling and yummy! If you're really hungry, order this combo! My friend ordered the green tea medetai and was a bit disappointed. It tasted like nothing.
Ellen S.}San Diego, CA}49}64}812}-1}4}1/20/2015}I would give this place 4 for the takoyaki. I saw some comments where it was not made fresh. I personally did not experience that. It took a bit for the order to come out since they did make it fresh for me. I was quite lucky where I got a decent octopus bites. the okonomiyaki was not bad either.I would go for a snack and share with couple of people a plate of takoyaki.
Mandy L.}Manhattan, NY}15}47}86}-1}4}1/19/2015}Really good snacks~~best come in summer, because it's small without seats, your puffy coat can't really fit. But in winter, it can be cozy: eating gorgeous food while it's snowing outside
Donna G.}Stony Brook, NY}26}62}66}-1}4}1/17/2015}Never tried takoyaki before and heard Otafuku was the place to go. The wait was longer than I expected (there was no line) but my goodness, the takoyaki was tasty! I got the banana/chocolate medetai. It came as a combo. It was okay... the batter was bland and the filling a bit too sweet for my liking. Also it was much too small. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience.
Nick C.}Ridgefield Park, NJ}334}997}1751}18}4}1/15/2015}So this is their new location a few stores down from their old hole in the wall. The space is much bigger and cleaner looking, but I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4.I come here specifically for takoyaki, and they made it fresh at the old location. When fresh, the insides are still molten batter with a chunk of octopus floating in it. Now that they sit under a heat lamp for awhile, they're not as good.
Carmen W.}Brooklyn, NY}214}274}220}18}3}1/14/2015}I'm a sucker for matcha so when I saw that matcha medetai, I was tempted to pay the extra 1.50 for it ($4.50). I was extremely disappointed as it did NOT taste like matcha at all, making it rather flavorless. If I had known, I would have bought the original! (Although I'm not so sure it'll be on par with the old Otafuku's medetai) I've also been here before it renovated, and I'm sad to see that they no longer make everything fresh. Part of this store's novelty is having the experience of watching the cooks stick pieces of octopus in your takoyaki, flip it around, and serve it to you FRESH. After the renovation, they just keep the takoyaki in a warmer and add the toppings after you order. P.S. They charge you tax even though they do not accept card... fishy fishy.
Kate O.}New York, NY}307}115}449}18}5}1/11/2015}always busy, always fast, always yummy, always fresh, always affordable... always my first choice for japanese street food!a simple menu that allows the kitchen to master their craft: takoyaki (think cake pops + meatballs + seafood = street food lovechild takoyaki octopus ball!!)runner up on the limited menu offering: waffle fish! emphasis more on the waffle part and none on the fish flavor part... a delightful crispy chewy sweet treat in a fun fish shape... be on the look out for seasonal flavors! they are made to order and on a limited daily supply.my only displeasure is the extreme lack of eating room. however, plates shaped like mini-wooden sushi boats and friendly staff with fast service more than pacifies my "where to eat the yummies!?!" inner rage...oh! big warning... CASH ONLY (but totally worth it and chase is 4 short blocks away)
Mary F.}Brooklyn, NY}104}452}935}-1}2}1/11/2015}Review is only on their green tea medetai. Inside of these fish waffles are red bean and mochis. I found it to be too doughy and too soft. I prefer a more crisp outside. The mochis on the ends were not to my likings. It didn't belong. Also, they are a bit stingy on the red bean. The best part is the red bean or else the whole thing is dried and tasteless! Pass.Oh also, limited quantities for the green tea version of medetai so come early.
Joy Y.}New York, NY}233}765}1166}18}3}1/10/2015}Medetai is fluffy and doughy but I dislike the big chunk of banana in the nutella flavor. Definitely get the red bean one instead. Currently they also have a green tea + mochi + red bean medetai special.
Ruoqi Z.}New York, NY}113}93}95}-1}4}1/8/2015}i only tried the takoyaki and the medetai. Have been following Otafuku since it was still in that tiny store where it can barely fit me and my friend.  The takoyaki is still as good as I remembered it. They have a new year's special macha medetai now too so try it before they take it off the menu.
Jenn F.}Brooklyn, NY}767}372}2328}18}3}12/27/2014}I'm glad that they moved to a new, slightly larger location. The old one wouldn't have been able to house my 2 friends and I. We would have been stuck outside on a cold December night.   The new Otafuku is designed like the joints in Japan- at least some standing room. I'm glad they put in a ledge, albeit super short lengthwise, for people to place their trays of food. The limit is 3-4 people max especially in the winter with everyone's puffy outerwear.   The takoyaki itself brought me back to Japan. It wasn't the best, but I have yet to find better thus far. Suggestions are welcome. The dough itself was soggy, and there was one half inch slice of octopus inside, which left me wanting more. The majority of the places I tried abroad had at least two slices.  I'm not a fan of medetai; I feel that it's difficult to balance the outer dough and filling within. My friend took the plunge, and felt it was just OK, but still satisfied her sweet tooth. I have tried medetai at other places and have yet to find one that's to my liking. Like I said, suggestions are welcome.
Xixi X.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}27}21}8}-1}2}12/26/2014}Decided to give this place a try after seeing all these good reviews. I got the combo A: Takayuki + medetai $9 Tankoyaki was gooey and soft. The good thing about it is that there are actual takos in it. I give a 3/5. The sauce is a bit too salty for my taste. Medetai: I got the Nutella chocolate with banana filling: it was too soft, too doughy, too too sweeeeet. 1/5. I couldn't even finish half of it. Threw it out! I needed a glass of water after that.
Justin L.}New York, NY}249}65}142}-1}4}12/23/2014}The food here is reasonably priced for the most part. I ordered combination B, which is an order of takoyaki with one okonomiyaki and then I proceeded to order one red bean taiyaki for dessert. The takoyaki were heavenly. Each one was hot and chewy. This confirmed the existence of there being actual octopus. I got the pork okonomiyaki,which was pretty good, but I wish they had incorporated the pork into it as opposed to just laying it on top. The taiyaki was nothing special. The only reason to get it is for aesthetic purposes. I mean, it's a pastry in the shape of a fish. That's pretty cool, but the taste was nothing worth bragging about. The store itself is pretty small, so there isn't really much seating. There's a counter top for people to eat, but it can fit 5-6 people tops. There's a bench outside, but people hog it too. I really wish there was more seating at this place.So to sum it up: This place is definitely worth checking out. The takoyaki are amazing here. The okonomiyaki was pretty good and the taiyaki wasn't bad, but not worth a repeat purchase.
Al L.}New York, NY}0}86}69}-1}4}12/14/2014}Great service. Reliable quality. Nice atmosphere. Good for to-go food.
Alice L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}191}905}-1}3}12/14/2014}I always order their takoyaki whenever I'm around that area. I've tried the Hazelnut Chocolate and Banana Medetai and their Okonomiyaki noodles too. The combo of the Okonomiyaki noodles with the takoyaki is really tasty together. It fills you up more than you think. The food is always made fresh in front of the customers and their service is fast. It's a little pricey though. They had the medetai in the flavors of red bean and banana hazelnut. They were alright, a little bland, and nothing special about them.
Cat D.}New York, NY}0}34}1}-1}4}12/13/2014}First impression -- this place is freakishly clean looking (and also empty). Kind of threw me off to why there were non-Japanese people behind the counter cooking my food (and they were speaking Spanish as well), which made me question the authenticity, but I decided to go for the takoyaki anyways. They served it to me within a minute and packaged it in a plastic container for me to eat (do not recommend because I looked like a total fatass stuffing takoyaki into my mouth while I was walking). The toppings and sauce were sooooooooooo good. The takoyaki themselves were really soft and warm in the inside, but I felt like my pieces of octopus were kinda small relative to the size of the takoyaki. Nonetheless, I'm definitely visiting this place again when I get cravings!
Lambros D.}Brooklyn, NY}0}5}0}-1}3}12/9/2014}I came here again after a few years salivating for those hot, almost burn your mouth temperature takoyaki and was left questioning my memory of how delicious the food was here. The takoyaki was grabbed from a heat lamp enclosure and just warm, not crunchy, somewhat dissapointing to me. It's a bad contrast to have a hot freshly prepared Okonomiyaki, with slightly warmed, soggy takoyaki. Hopefully next time I come around those balls of deliciousness will live up to my memory of them.
Ani T.}Brooklyn, NY}21}109}29}-1}3}12/6/2014}Ordered Combo A, which consisted of takoyaki and medetai w/ chocolate and bananas. Never tried takoyaki so i'll try to keep my review fair: it was okay. The takoyaki was really saucy, maybe a bit too much. The inside was good but it was more bread than meat. The medetai was on the okay side for me, i guess i should have ordered the red bean filling one.
Chris A.}Seattle, WA}346}137}74}18}4}12/4/2014}Takoyaki!? YES PLEASEI love takoyaki... so much so that I bought a takoyaki pan to make my own at home! Otafuku does a great and authentic Takoyaki and Medetai. I suggest you try each of them.What makes it good? crispy outside, good amount of mayo and takoyaki sauce and some awesome dipping sauce choices. Then when youre done there is Medetai. Its waaaaay good. Red bean filling. Awesome opposum.Happy eating my friends. Stay hungry!
Lisa Y.}Elmhurst, NY}54}130}231}-1}4}11/30/2014}Been a favorite if mine for years. First place that I've ever eaten a Japanese pancake. I missed their first hole in the wall shop. I felt the quality of the original shop was much better esp the pancakes, the new shop is still good but the batter isn't quite the same and not as gingery. I rate the original shop 5 stars and the new one 3. So it's a 4.
Ashley W.}Portland, ME}295}71}56}18}5}11/30/2014}Best takoyaki I've ever had!!!! Just the right amount of crisp on the outside, while soft and chewy on the inside.
Hana J.}Los Angeles, CA}632}628}612}-1}4}11/30/2014}We tried everything on the menu--takoyaki and okonomiyaki and medetai (the fish-shaped bread stuffed with your choice) and loved everything except the medetai. As a Korean, I grew up on this fish bread and was disappointed that the ones here are really dense. We got the red bean and the banana chocolate one and both flavors were too mushy and mellow..Regardless, this is the perfect snack spot, either before or after dinner (if you're a fatty like me.) Bacon-covered okonomiyaki..yummm. Food takes a while to come out even if the food appears to be prepped non stop. "Standing room" is very limited as well (I'm a Californian so I'm not used to these tight spaces) so prepare to be rubbing elbows and already a small counter space with strangers.
Saesi S.}Seminole County, FL}2}4}13}-1}4}11/29/2014}Awesome as always! Takoyaki tastes much better than the orders I had when I was in Japan.
Raena Z.}Corona, NY}2}30}68}-1}4}11/19/2014}I ordered the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo. They were really good, but I waited a while for the food. Sometimes, it can get very crowded, and since there aren't that many workers, a combo order might take longer than a single order. The store is quite small, with only a small space to eat, and there are no seats, so many people take their food somewhere else to eat. Anyway, you can see them make the food right in front of you, so you know that everything is made from scratch, and it isn't packaged frozen stuff. Drinks are $2 bucks or more including canned soda, ramune, etc. All in all, I'm a happy customer :)
Alice C.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}67}104}919}18}4}11/16/2014}This is a place for a quick yummy does of Takoyaki balls and custard/red bean fish. It is probably the most authentic Japanese snake place you can find in NYC. It's a joyful thing to watch as the staff are making the Takoyaki balls and custard fishy. I love this place and I will come back!
Karen S.}Jersey City, NJ}68}48}171}-1}4}11/11/2014}I grew up watching anime and loved the way their food is animated I've always wanted to taste takoyaki and okonomiyaki . I've never had medetai or taiyaki I've had mochi and other bean buns. So when I heard of this place just 20 min ride from my home I was so excited ! Finally I could get to try all the Japanese street foods. Service is great and the people complaining how the workers their aren't Japanese   get a life . People hire all types of people from other ethnic backgrounds to help out with running a restaurant if I remember reading correctly this place is newly renovated from their old spot. Maybe the owners just decided their hard work paid off and now they are training a team who does a great job of replicating Japanese food. Just a few tweaks I feel should be made . I've read and seen many pictures of okonomiyaki and I got the whole pancake idea in my head . What I received was more cabbage than dough lol which was still great but let's face it I was not in a mood for a health crazed meal. I wanted a hearty fluffy pancake with the whole shi-bang! It was still great . I'm NOT a fan of the bonito flakes they are too big for my taste maybe smaller and I could deal love how they crumble though. The takoyaki was exactly what I expected. So yummy and soft inside . I of course had the chocolate hazelnut and banana medetai which was Delish ! I've had enough red bean buns to figure what the medetai would taste like I've been here twice and the first time I had combo B which I recommend it'll definitely fill you up. And the last time I went which was last week I had combo A and my friend had Combo B so we shared her okonomiyaki which was slightly better than the last one I had. It had more batter. Other than that.. My only issue is .... CASH ONLY . Okay seriously guys 2014 going on 2015 . We can have a square set up or even capital one spark pay . It's not that hard or AT LEAST have an ATM for customer use  I dunno but imagine all the business you'd get just by accepting credit cards . Merchant services is a SMALL fee to pay for all the service you'll receive .
Kelly C.}Brooklyn, NY}447}157}592}18}2}11/4/2014}The old Otafuku was half the size but had twice as much character, better food and lower prices. This new location is run by non-Japanese cooks and the food is noticeably less well prepared. I used to love getting red bean taiyakis here but they've increased from $2 to $3 and waiting 15+ minutes expecting a hot, fresh cake just to receive a pre-made one that's been hastily warmed up to cover up its staleness is an insult to my time and money. I won't return anytime soon, but I'll remember Otafuku's former glory.
Sam W.}Denver, CO}2}20}1}-1}3}10/31/2014}A bit overpriced for what you're getting, which isn't much. Takoyaki was too moist. Okonomiyaki was good, but the portion was ridiculously small. If you want to have LUNCH here, you'd be better off ordering two combos (talking about your stomach, not your wallet). Otherwise you'd just be snacking.
Anastasia W.}San Diego, CA}121}396}90}-1}4}10/27/2014}Cute little shop that sells takoyaki (Japanese savory pancakeballs with octopus filling) and medetai (taiyaki - Japanese lucky fish shaped sweet cakes).  The line was not too bad, and it seemed to be moving at a reasonable pace.  The only downside is that the medetai (taiyaki) take a lot longer to cook than takoyaki, so we were standing around for 10 minutes waiting for our redbean and Chestnut taiyakis.The taiyaki themselves were great - fresh/hot right off the grill, and the filling was good too.  I did not try the takoyaki, but they looked really good!  They were on the larger side for takoyaki, and an order includes 6.   They have nice combos so you can try both takoyaki and medetai (taiyaki).  Please note - they are cash only!

John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}4}10/26/2014}The takoyaki is amazing.  Even better than what I had in Kyoto recently.  Downside is the lack of space and seating.  Good Japanese street food.
Jellene F.}Brooklyn, NY}150}42}245}-1}5}10/25/2014}It was my first time, so I picked up a combo to taste most of what they offered. I had Combo A, which is the Takoyaki and Medetai (I picked the red bean medetai). It was AMAZING! They ask if you want extra toppings or sauces on it, but I didn't ask for any. The original was great as it is.There was a long line but it surprisingly went by quickly. My minor complaints: not enough room for seating, and it's cash onlyThe food completely made up for it though. I will definitely be back again!
Laurie W.}New York, NY}307}470}596}18}4}10/22/2014}If you're a newbie like me and want to try everything - go for the combo!I got combo A which is the takoyaki and medatai.  6 pieces of takoyaki is good enough! The great thing is you can opt for the sauces on the side or not, I prefer to have things come the way it originally does (unless you have an allergy!) The takoyaki is very airy and fluffy and doughy!  I used a fork (I know, how could I!) and it deflated! It's really hot so be careful!  I do wish the pieces of octopus will be bigger or more pieces, I felt like I ate more dough than anything.  The sauces can be a bit overwhelming so I scape it to the side.  I also got a side of wasabi mayo and it help curb some of the sweet tangy sauce.The medetai (red bean..duh), I like to think I had better but that was in HK.  The red bean was very centered and chunky, and I think the one I had in Hong Kong was a bit spread out and thinner so I'm not just eating red bean paste.  The bread was sweet and delicious and thick.  Could be a BIT more crispy.Cash only!
Kathy O.}Flushing, NY}1}28}1}-1}4}10/16/2014}I've been coming to this place even before they moved to this new location. I'm glad that they managed to get a larger place! They can finally afford to have more than three people in the store at same time.The takoyaki here are the best that I've ever had in NYC. They are somewhat soft but still packed. They don't overdo it with the sauce as well (unlike some other places). I like eating the takoyaki with the bonito flakes but you can tell them to not add any if you don't like those.They have a bunch of combo sets that are worth it also. I usually get the combo with takoyaki and okonomiyaki and just go somewhere nearby to eat it. There is also a bench outside for you but I wouldn't count on getting a seat there since this place is kinda popular.I've tried their green tea parfait which is okay.  I liked the green tea icecream but the chocolate pocky sticks didn't go well with it. The pancake slices got soggy from being soaked in the icecream. The red bean topping was okay as well.
Yvette Y.}Atlanta, GA}34}57}2}-1}4}10/16/2014}The takoyaki is good, okonomi is bad. It's crowded. And in general, it doesn't live up to my expectation.
Alan L.}Brooklyn, NY}221}672}3371}18}2}10/14/2014}I'm not the biggest fan of octopus, but give this place another try. I got the combo A set which is takoyaki + medetai. It's a good deal for $9. The takoyaki (grilled octopus balls that are crispy on the outside, soft & doughy on the inside. slathered with our special sauce, topped with ribbons of mayonnaise & garnished with big flakes of dried bonito) was not fresh at all. It was already pre made and was sitting under a heated lamp. It was not crispy and I could not really taste the octopus. There was too much special sauce which overpowered the takoyaki. The medetai (sweet, crispy & fluffy. hand-held snack shaped like a red snapper, which symbolizes happiness. filled to the fins with sweet red bean or hazelnut chocolate & banana) was not fresh either. I saw one the ladies just take pre made one and just reheated it. I got the hazelnut chocolate & banana. Just didn't taste as good if it was made from scratch. Freshness was really the biggest issue here for me.
Alex D.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}3}10/10/2014}Tiny little spot putting out good Japanese street food for a decent price. I had the takoyaki and pork okonomiyaki combo. Big portions, but there was very little octopus in the takoyaki. The okonomiyaki wasn't the best I've ever had, too cabbagey and a little on the greasy side. I also felt they put too much sauce and bonito flakes all everything, making it all kind of taste the same. But it tasted good and was very filling, I got two meals out of it for 11 bucks. Would like to try some of their dessert items. I'd go back if I were in the neighborhood.
Sandy N.}Sacramento, CA}274}875}2213}18}2}10/10/2014}My first takoyaki and I was disappointed. I guess I expected more from the reviews.
Yssa L.}Bay Ridge, NY}125}31}549}-1}5}10/8/2014}Tokoyaki Overload, I will be back here for sure! A small spot near st. marks but its all worth the try, next time I will try the red bean pancake, I'm missing my tokoyaki balls already! Cool spot to have a quick grab, sit outside so you can enjoy people watching.
Kara L.}New York, NY}3}5}0}-1}2}10/5/2014}What happened to this place?? In it's old location, the takoyaki was amazing. Freshly made to order, crispy, delicious. I was happy to wait the couple minutes for yummy takoyaki. Now in its new location, it has lost everything that made it great. Nothing is made fresh, except for the okonomiyaki, which takes about 20 minutes to make. Medetai and takoyaki were both premade and sitting under a heat lamp. Which you think would make service fast, but it wasn't. After waiting all the time, the takoyaki was soggy and flavorless. Okonomiyaki was nothing to write home about. The only thing that was good was medetai. So disappointed :(
Jason H.}Manhattan, NY}534}379}2}18}3}10/4/2014}This place looks different from what I remember.  The octopus balls are still good, and a bargain - $7 for 6.  The sauce and mayo is good, and the balls themselves are nice and chewy and creamy on the inside, with a good bit of octopus.  Tasty!
Annie N.}Brooklyn, NY}160}274}715}18}4}9/29/2014}WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE CUTE JAPANESE GUYS WHO USE TO MAKE IT DOWN THE BLOCK?!?! I like that their new location is bigger but it doesn't seem as legit anymore when i walked in and saw 5 mexicans making takoyaki... (i thought i was at the wrong spot and had to double check their sign) their takoyaki is still the best in NYC since i have YET to find a spot better than this, every bite was loaded with octopus goodness! I dont know what it is.. but it taste a little different than before... somethings missing... is it the lack of mayo... or the green thing they use to put on top? hmm i cant seem to quite put my hands on it, still the best there is out there so DEFINITELY give this place a try!
Ameer S.}Chicago, IL}188}242}73}-1}2}9/28/2014}I've never had Japanese octopus balls (Takoyaki) and Japanese savory pancakes (Okonomiyaki), so I unfortunately do not have a good standard for comparison. Nonetheless, the amount of sauces (mayo + sweet BBQ-esque sauce) they pounded on top of the takoyaki and okonomiyaki really took away from the unique tastes of both of them, and they were unfortunately almost indistinguishable from each other after the exorbitant amount of sauce. Also, there was BARELY any octopus at all in the takoyaki. It was dumbed down to just a ball of salty spongy fried dough. The bacon on top of the okonomiyaki, however, was awesome.
Toby D.}Fairfax, VA}113}171}670}18}5}9/28/2014}Was here with a food tour, we had the cabbage pancake aka okonomiyaki - was delicious and noodles just right, could totally eat a whole plate of that. Was heavier than typical Japanese food, but more satisfying. Not much space to eat, some benches outside for waiting for your order, most get to go. Would like to go back and try more of their menu.
Nilsa L.}Brooklyn, NY}56}262}285}18}4}9/27/2014}I'm glad that Otafuku moved to its new location. It looks cleaner and more modern. The best thing is now it has TWO benches instead of one. Hahaha. Such an upgrade! There's also space where you can eat inside while standing up, but it's quite hot and stuffy in there. So I would't recommend it unless you need to keep warm. I don't remember if the prices are raised but I enjoyed the food just as much. While eating outside on the bench, there were many people who would walk up and peek inside curiously. A few people asked us what we were eating. When I mention octopus, their eyes look like deer in headlights. I told one girl, "it's ok; it's not alive or anything". I can't wait until my next visit so I can try the other menu items to make sure they are the same as when they made it from their old store.
Teasy S.}New York, NY}25}32}299}-1}4}9/27/2014}Everything is good with that kind of price.their takoyaki is awesome,bigger than the one I had before.I love this tiny sweet place ;3
Jenny L.}Brooklyn, NY}214}93}47}-1}5}9/26/2014}Balls. Japanese Octopus Balls.Okay sorry about the starting line, I just had to. This little hole in the wall is a cute addition to the stores on this block. For about $7 bucks you can buy yourself a set of 6 made-in-your-face, fresh out the pan, Takoyaki balls. Toppled with extra condiments of mayo, seaweed, dried squid, and sauce, and you have yourself a 5 star meal.I did not get to try their other specialties, the dessert shaped like fish. Will try next time!Bottom line: skip the line at smorgasburg and hit this spot up.
Mar C.}Manhattan, NY}66}152}10}-1}4}9/21/2014}This place rocks.The takoyaki is authentic. I wish they would include more octopus:ball ratio, but I guess that would not be as cost effective. Not too many places to sit, more of a eat while walking or eat while standing outside. Probably the best takoyaki you can get in Manhattan as of this date. Enjoy.
Tony R.}New York, NY}56}146}69}-1}3}9/20/2014}The food takes a while to prepare but that is only because they make it in front of you. The pricing was ok, and the food is better than average but not great. I would come here again if I really wanted some takoyaki.
Yimei M.}Queens, NY}682}174}821}-1}3}9/13/2014}I would have rated the old Otafuku a 4.5 stars if they hadn't moved down the block. Yes, their new location is much more spacious and offers a mini bar inside the shop and a bench outside for you to enjoy your takoyaki, but their food does not compare to the original. It used to be $5 (no tax!) for an order of 6 takoyaki. When they increased it to $6, I couldn't even complain because it was still a bargain and a good eat. Now it's $7+tax for almost the same takoyaki as before. Plus, they just got rid of their sriracha bottle that I used to love with my takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Now, they offer 4 different spicy sauces with an extra $0.50! That sriracha bottle needs to come back...On the other hand, I still occasionally come to Otafuku for a quick bite. Definitely try their takoyaki since it's more on the better side of Japanese fast comfort foods in New York. Their combo of any kind is worth it and it'll leave you completely satiated! My favorite is takoyaki and okonomiyaki with squid. Don't get the pork if you're not a crazy bacon fan. **Don't forget that this place is cash only!!***
Linh N.}Franklin Park, NJ}32}36}11}-1}3}9/11/2014}Got the takoyaki + okonomiyaki combo, also did try their "fish cake". They were good but not that impressive. I expected the takoyaki to have a bit more octopus inside, and not 95% batter :(. Personally I enjoyed the okonomiyaki more. The fish cake is just okay. The portion isn't bad at all tho! I probably will come back, but I'm sure there are better places in NYC.
Hideki A.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}2}-1}2}9/10/2014}Not a place to get something quick. It does not manage wait time expectation well. When I arrived at the bistro, there weren't many people. But I waited for 30 mins seeing staffs chatting with little rush. Be prepared to stand there for more than 30 mins for a combo
Lillith T.}Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY}7}17}12}-1}4}9/7/2014}I'm glad they moved to a slightly bigger location because they're previous one was a tiny hole in the wall. Anyway I came here today and got takoyaki. They had it ready immediately after I ordered and I only had to wait after one person on line, unlike their old location where I had to wait as long as 10-15  minutes to order and get my food. They raised the price from $6 to $7 plus tax for 6 octopus balls. The takoyaki was hot and topped with condiments. The sauces on it made it taste really good. I sat where there was a bench for customers to sit outside to eat since there is no indoor seating available. I think the combos are more worth the price than just getting a single item on the menu.
Fiona L.}New Brunswick, NJ}425}349}1590}-1}3}8/31/2014}I ordered the takoyaki, the original ones, and it was okay! I've had better. The inside was very soft and gooey, but the outside wasn't as crispy as I expected. Also, some places make them on the spot, but the order I got tasted like it was already made. It was warm but wasn't steaming hot and fresh! Though it was very fast. I literally paid and got the takoyaki in the next second. Since they moved recently, the place is still very new and clean. Sitting inside is not possible but there was a side table for ppl to start and eat. There are also two benches outside to eat. Before we ordered, they would ask if we are eating here or to go. I noticed that they have a simple menu and usually they restaurants don't have an elaborate menu, they really make those food well. Maybe if I eat at a different time when ppl are rolling in and out the quality will be better, but nonetheless, the good was still pretty good.
L Y.}Atlanta, GA}4}47}5}-1}3}8/28/2014}Good sized portions.  I didn't think it was as delicious as I really hoped it would be.  My friend and I shared a combo A and an order of shrimp okonomiyaki.  The  takoyaki was awesome.  The nutella banana medetai we had, as other reviewers have mentioned...was a bit cakey and I wish it had more filling but considering I have never had medetai before, maybe it's supposed to be that way.  I wish I loved the okonomoiyaki.  I have been craving it and hoping to find a really fantastic place.  I wanted to love love love Otafuku but I didn't.  I'd definitely go back for the takoyaki though!
Cherry K.}Brooklyn, NY}0}15}3}-1}4}8/27/2014}It's really hard to find taiyaki in NYC and I have to say I was super excited to find it at otafuku. It's cute and super yummy.
Amy D.}Pleasantville, NJ}17}36}7}-1}3}8/25/2014}Maybe it was because I was way too excited to try this place out from all the reviews but j was definitely not impressed. I got the takoyaki + okonomiyaki combo. I would definitely not recommend the okonomiyaki! It was all cabbage/veggie, def not enough batter. It took WAY TO LONG for them to make it. The takoyaki was alright, not crunchy enough for my liking. But the filing was pretty decent. I've def had way better takoyaki. Would def not go out of the way for this place. If you're craving some takoyaki and are around the area, then it's worth the visit.
W Y.}Seattle, WA}0}3}0}-1}5}8/24/2014}The okonomiyaki and takoyaki is like the ones I have had in Japan. The nice big flakes on the outside and the bacon on top and the squid on the inside. And its at reasonable prices!
Paula Z.}Manhattan, NY}60}60}67}-1}3}8/22/2014}I've been going to Otafuku way back in the days when their takoyaki was still five dollars (say whaattt!!!) and their location was a cramped space that could only accommodate the astounding number of exactly three customers. (plus possibly one tiny child?) Ever since they moved to their larger location, I can't help but reminisce of the days when I actually loved their okonomiyaki. This is due to the unfortunate fact that their okonomiyaki had wayyy more cabbage than any other ingredients. I mean... there lacked a balance with the meat. There was a mouthful full of cabbage and SOME meat than anything. Now I have to sadly say that *cough* theplacenearbywiththecottoncandymachine *cough* now has better tasting okonomiyaki where they actually put more ingredients. Now onto what they're REALLY known for- the takoyaki! Gone are the days when I would eagerly bite in these octopus balls and potentially burn the roof of my mouth! They tend to serve pre-made takoyaki which makes it less awesome/fresher than before. Their takoyaki is decent but since I know that it was better before, it just makes me less excited about going in there as often as I did before. Upside-I would still say that they still serve the biggest octopus balls in NY that I've ever had. That is all.
Sarah S.}Philadelphia, PA}27}346}4}18}4}8/20/2014}We only came in here for the Green Tea Parfait.  The Green Tea ice cream itself was so good.  I could definitely taste the green tea.  it was topped with mochi, red bean, and two pocky sticks.  LOVED this.
M K.}New York, NY}2}122}11}-1}3}8/17/2014}Came here with SO much anticipation over the takoyaki and taiyaki but instead felt like it was a HUGE let down. After realizing this is the very same takoyaki place that i used to go to, I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed as I had nothing but great things to say about their food in my old visits. However, Otafuku now pre-makes as much takoyaki as they can and set them aside in a warm oven for convenience. The result makes the takoyaki lukewarm and way too "solid" when the takoyaki is suppose to be flowing like hot lava in your mouth when you take a bite (it used to be that way). The Okonomiyaki was made fresh and tasted better in comparison but I have to say it took the longest time... but at least it was good. The only thing I'd say is that it didn't have that much shrimps. The taiyaki was a disappointment as well. I had the chocolate hazelnut banana flavour. The filling was pretty tasty and what I considered an interesting mix, but the fish shaped crust didn't taste like it was freshly made - it wasn't fluffy; it was more on the stale side. I had anticipated to come here for more than a couple weeks and I gatta say I walked way with a shrug for the food. It's alright if you are just passing by and needing a  snack but nothing worthy of making a special trip for. Plus am I fooled by my own memory or do they actually used to have more than one flavours of takoyaki? Indeed the store front is nicer but the food.... o well ::shrug::
Tina W.}New York, NY}421}905}1193}18}4}8/13/2014}7 for 6 huge takoyaki, which tastes exactly like the original Japanese flavor. will come back for other food for sure
Dennis L.}New York, NY}77}196}1}-1}4}8/11/2014}Their new location is much more spacious than their previous one (even though it is still small).  It's much more pleasant now though because you can wait in in air conditioned area during the summer.  Otafuku is a fast food place, but sometimes the wait can be pretty long.  They serve essentially 3 main dishes:Takoyaki (octopus balls) - Their signature dish.  Does not really have much octopus in it, and is comprised mostly of a what flour batter.  Honestly, the octopus doesn't matter, it's like a delicious round pancake ball of goodness...but not exactly a pancake.  Yakisoba:  The dish I find myself ordering most often from here.  There really isn't anything particularly special about it here.  It's above-average quality, consistently good, and has fed my night hunger on many occasions.  Okonomiyaki - Had this once, and thought it was the weakest of the three.  The cabbage in it just wasn't cooked well, and it just made the entire dish a letdown.  They also serve dessert items here, but I've never tried any of them.
Michelle L.}Manhattan, NY}6}78}10}-1}2}8/11/2014}I came here specifically for the taiyaki / medetai. I was obsessed with Bungeoppang when I visited Korea a year ago, and I was really excited to find a Japanese shoppe with taiyaki in NYC!The taiyaki, though, was pretty disappointing. The pastry / dough part wasn't at all like that of the Bungeoppang that I had in Korea. It wasn't crispy or piping hot. It was just mehhh. And the red bean was very sweet. Like it consisted more of sugar than of red bean.Sorely disappointed :(
Paul L.}Los Angeles, CA}6}108}8}-1}4}8/10/2014}Solid Takoyaki, basically the only thing I would get here.  Quick service.  Try to get it when it's freshly freshly made, it's the best.
Betty L.}Rego Park, Queens, NY}135}28}18}-1}3}8/8/2014}Takoyaki was pretty average and the taiyaki was pretty bad. I was really hoping for better food.The takoyaki was actually pretty decent, very soft and chewy on the inside. However, the sauce was a little too overbearing. The sauce almost completely covered the taste of the seafood, instead of accentuating it. The taiyaki... I will never buy it from here again. It seems like they only reheat the taiyaki, it is not fresh. The bread is pretty much exactly like a pancake mix. It's not even close to crispy on the outside, it's actually pretty floppy and soft all around. The dough was surprisingly dry too, and my friend got hiccups after eating it. I was just disappointed that the taiyaki wasn't even close to what I expected. A place supposedly specializes in Japanese street snacks, I expected more.I gave Otafuku 3 stars instead of 2 because I have not tried all their snacks and foods. Maybe when I try all of their items, I'll update this.
gwen L.}New York, NY}3}135}0}-1}3}8/6/2014}Very good takoyaki.  It's comparable to ones I grew up on.  The octopus balls are very authentic except it's missing the benishoga as a topping.  The benishoga kills the takoyaki, in my opinion.Now as for their okonomiyaki, it was a bit of a disappointment.  I've only tried theirs once (and I'm willing to give it a try again), but the one time I had it, it was too cabbage-y.  The pork okonomiyaki was overladen with cabbage.  So much so that cabbage was all I could taste.  The proportion of batter to meat to cabbage was waaaaay off.   After a few bite, I just wanted to throw up (I like cabbage, but not so much that I'm willing to eat cabbage pancake).The prices are quite reasonable.  I would definitely be going back, if not for the okonomiyaki, for their takoyaki.
Melanie T.}Manhattan, NY}26}320}218}-1}5}8/6/2014}I can't believe it took me this long to try this place out, and now that I have I have to say that I'm in love, obsessed, and very impressed. Yeah, that was lame, whatever, I know. But, the takoyaki were so good. The food is pretty cheap and the portions are generous. I mean Mimi and Coco serves a similar thing, but theirs are smaller. The takoyaki here is chewy on  the outside and soft and delicious on the inside with lots of yummy veggies, and a piece of grilled octopus. The toppings and sauce on top really take the takoyaki over the edge. I also got the parfait, and I really recommend it. The green tea soft serve was delicious, smooth and creamy. It came with two chocolate pocky sticks, one hard shiratama (not that great, but whatever), red bean paste, and a taiyaki cut in half. The taiyaki was so good, crispy on the outside and chewy and soft in the inside. So yummy!!!!! I was left with a full and happy belly.
Leanna L.}San Jose, CA}39}13}51}-1}2}7/24/2014}Just stopped by today as one of my top spots to hit up while on vacation in New York per my cousin's recommendation. She's a major foodie so I expected great things from the takoyaki she recommended. However...I was majorly disappointed as our two orders of takoyaki (12 pieces total) weren't freshly prepared and didn't even come close to being as mouthwateringly good as the ones I'm spoiled with at Tajima in San Diego. I watched as the server reached into a heating storage to grab the balls and then proceed to top them with their special sauce, mayo, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was warm, not crispy on the outside, a tad soggy, and barely filled. It was edible but wasn't anything spectacular.Maybe it was an off day. Maybe the takoyaki was better when my cousin had them before the relocation. The only plus was that they didn't skimp on the bonito flakes.
Alice U.}Brooklyn, NY}0}18}1}-1}2}7/22/2014}The new location is great, but ever since they moved the takoyaki has been mediocre. They used to be fresh, steamy hot and crispy on the outside. Now they sit in a heated display for god knows how long. The result is a mushy ball with sauce.
Linda C.}New York, NY}29}136}177}-1}4}7/22/2014}I stopped by this place with a friend since she's been to the old location before and she really enjoyed the takoyaki balls that they had. When we got there, we both ordered an order of takoyaki balls each and it wasn't freshly made in front of us. The person behind the cash register took it out from this heat storage place (not sure what it's called). It was still warm but I would've preferred to have it freshly made and I wouldn't have mind waiting. The takoyaki is pretty good even though I didn't like the bonito flakes.
Canny F.}Knoxville, TN}621}1563}6641}18}1}7/22/2014}Not fresh! I was hoping for a crispy warm outer layer, with a soft texture on the inside like anything baked freshly tastes like. But this was like a microwavable french fry. You can only imagine how soggy of a taste it had. The hazelnut chocolate banana tasted better than the red bean but both were still not good. Way too pricey for it's real value.
Danny Y.}New York, NY}27}40}0}-1}4}7/21/2014}Otafuku is the only place I go for takoyaki, okonomiyaki and yakisoba.A friend of mine introduced me to them a long time ago and I am a instant fan.The takoyaki is full of flavour, the octopus is not chewy and you get them fresh.The okonomiyaki is the same and tasty as always although I think they shrunk in size...The yakisoba is always the same as I remember before they moved.The old Otafuku used to be a literal hole-in-the-wall so I'm glad they moved to a bigger space.Please now that everything here is made fresh so the wait time will be pretty long.The only downer is that they used to have more options for toppings but I can deal with the less options.
Jen A.}Jersey City, NJ}20}18}15}-1}1}7/20/2014}Where were the guys that used to make these takoyaki balls? Are they off on Sundays coz the one I just got @ 4pm 07/20/72 tasted like they experimented on the batter.This place was consistent for years..so disappointed.
Aria H.}New York, NY}15}154}41}-1}4}7/19/2014}The tasty takoyaki aside, the okonomiyaki I tried today was also surprisingly decent. Took a long time to make though (I guess that couldn't be helped).
Kar N.}Manhattan, NY}54}129}99}-1}4}7/14/2014}I came here for the first time while roaming in saint marks. I had takoyaki for the first time and it was pretty good. I wasn't sure what it was at first and shortly after realized that it was squid. This is a really cute place for a snack, the yakisoba looked really good. Going to try that next.
Kel C.}Brooklyn, NY}14}34}0}-1}3}7/13/2014}Ever since they moved, their octopus balls are not as good as it use to be. The filling insides is less than what is use to be and sometimes one or two balls would not have octopus inside of it. Besides that everything else taste the same. It is still worth the wait since the food is made fresh in front of you. Now the store is bigger and there is a small stand up bar for you to eat at, but don't expect it to be available on the weekends. The store is packed and you don't want to be standing their with your food and the crowd of customers. You might as well eat outside or across the street.
Rosy V.}Philadelphia, PA}131}253}1106}18}5}7/12/2014}This is actually a pretty cool place for a quick grab. They have a very small menu, but tastes great, very quick service and just has that cool Japanese vibe to it. You can watch them make your dishes right in front of you too which I think is pretty awesome. The one thing you MUST get if you come here is their takoyaki, which is awesome! They also have okinomiyaki and taiyaki as well, but when I went their we finished eating a big meal not too long ago so we just grab some takoyaki for the road trip home. This is not a sit in restaurant and it gets REALLY crowded. It's a tiny place with a small standing location so you can order your food. There is an option of a long small counter where you stand, but there are no seats. You can stand here and eat for a couple minutes, but I do recommend that if you go here you grab the food and walk and eat, since it's in NY.
Monica L.}Los Angeles, CA}2409}1228}1575}18}5}7/9/2014}I kid you not, this is the BEST takoyaki I've ever tasted!! I don't know about their other goods (their okonomiyaki looks amazing), but the takoyaki is full of flavor, soft on the inside, light skin on outside, and bites of tako in every chomp I take! Definitely make a pit stop here for the yummiest balls you can ever put in your mouth (har har har...)
Josephine L.}Brooklyn, NY}377}28}4}-1}5}7/8/2014}I blame Otafuku for my constant craving for Takoyaki since my first encounter at their old location several years ago. At the time, I had no idea what the doughy/cripsy looking balls were and reluctantly took a bite after the urging of a friend. Needless to say- my life was changed. I've tried Takoyaki at several locations in the city but nothing beats the quality, freshness and taste of Otafuku. I finally paid their new location a visit after trying (and being constantly disappointed) Takoyaki at other places and I'm reminded of how delicious these damn things are. I'll definitely be back... probably tomorrow.
Kenneth P.}San Francisco, CA}12}18}13}-1}3}7/6/2014}Mediocre takoyaki. They were all premade and stored in the warmer and become luke-warm and dried. A bit disappointed.
Lily Z.}Queens, NY}81}145}77}-1}4}7/6/2014}I've been a fan of this place ever since it was a hole in the wall. I love their takoyaki so much! I find myself craving for them here and there.This place has moved up the street (as opposed to their old location, which was near the end of the street). This place is not that big but its bigger than their old location. There are some 'tables' attached to the all where you can stand and quickly eat your food. There's also two benches outside their store now as compared to their one bench. One thing that I don't like about this new place is that they pre make their takoyaki and put it in the warmer box thing. I was expecting them to make it fresh like they used to in their old store. I think they're taking advantage of their new space and using the warmer thing when I am 100% sure everyone would rather have them make it fresh. I miss the burning in my mouth feeling when I would pop one of the takoyakis in my mouth. The takoyaki I ate this time wasn't crispy since it was kept warm after it was made. Stop being lazy, otafuku! I know you want service to go faster but fresh takoyaki tastes better! Get a move on it! I remember in the old location they used to make it so fast because they didn't have the warmer option. Other than those complaints, 5 star for the takoyaki. It's still as good.
Thomas M.}Brooklyn, NY}102}315}135}-1}3}7/3/2014}The okonomomiyaki (or however you spell it) here is pretty good. It's light tasting and packed with shrimp. The Takoyaki here is really what they are known for and sad to say I was disappointed. There's just barely any squid in them whatsoever. I really don't think that is what they should taste like. You're basically eating the dough, getting a tiny piece of squid and eating the fish flakes and sauce. For the price they are charging you, this is a really expensive novelty snack. Come and try it, but I really doubt you would come back for seconds unless you really really loved fish flakes. I just don't.
Teresa V.}New York, NY}144}155}736}18}5}7/1/2014}Don't come in expecting a wide variety of food selection because Otafuku focuses on primarily serving Takoyakis and Okonomiyakis which honestly were some of the best that I've had!! Very reasonably priced the layout of the store makes you feel like you're in a rather legit store found along the streets of Japan! Great place to grab a quick bite with some friends while roaming the streets of New York! Will definitely come back for more~
Abigail T.}Glendale, Queens, NY}2598}362}3340}-1}4}6/29/2014}Otafuku is a small place dedicated to Japan's street foods - Medetai, Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki and Soba. We tried Combo B and their banana and chocolate hazelnut Medetai. 6 pieces of Takoyaki and Pork Okonomiyaki. Their Octopus balls are the closest anyone can get to the original. My only problem with it is is that it's a little more airy. The Takoyaki we had in Tokyo was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with pieces of octopus.  Otafuku's crispy and creamy but has less filling in those balls. They won't skimp on the bonito flakes tho which I love. A definite plus. Their Okonomiyaki or pancake with pork was a little bland. Might be the fact that we didn't put that much condiment on top of it or the thinly sliced pork/bacon that was supposed to give it taste was a little tough to cut through.Their Medetai is smaller than what I had in Tokyo. We should have tried the original red bean. Banana with very little Nutella. It's great with the fresh banana just wanted a little more chocolate hazelnut. You'll barely taste it.Even with all that I'd still give Otafuku 5 stars. It's the closest NYC has gotten to Japan's original street food. Why four stars then? Minus one for the super slow service. Street food is supposed to be on the go and quick. Waiting 20 mins for your order kind of defeat the purpose. But I'm still willing to wait a while for something that brings back great memories of a wonderful trip.
Brian L.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}509}604}1466}18}4}6/27/2014}I was never a huge fan of Takoyaki, but it was Japan that changed my mind about these little crispy hot octopus filled batter balls.  Otafuku comes very close to the Takoyaki I've come across in Tokyo.  They were cripsy on the outside, gooey and creamy in the inside with the sweet sauce and Japanese mayo topped with bonito.  We actualy ordered the combo that came with the Okonomiyaki (pork - which was just bacon).  This I didn't like as much.  It was a little bland.  The cooking of the Takoyaki was not artfully done as well.  In Tokyo, they used two sticks and rotated the balls gracefully and quickly.  Here, they stab it in the middle to flip it over and they are slow about it.  Also ordered the Taiyaki or which they called Medetai.  Instead of the red bean filling, we got the chocolate hazelnut banana.  It's a 1/4 of a banana with Nutella.  Stick to the Red Bean.  One pet peeve about this place is how long it takes to get your order.  We waited for probably 20 minutes just to get our octo balls.  If you're patient and love Takoyaki, it might be somewhat worth it.
Ashley F.}Elmhurst, NY}1}11}7}-1}4}6/25/2014}Reason I don't give them a 5 stars was because I was hoping they would make my takoyaki fresh which obviously they didn't, they just took it out of a food warmer after I placed my order. I understand they get busy at times but I don't mind waiting. Anything freshly made always tasted better than anything that was pre-made and kept warm . Very disappointing Medetai
Nancy Z.}San Francisco, CA}120}293}478}-1}5}6/22/2014}Same delicious takoyaki, just moved few yards west to a bigger spot. The place have a counter on the back wall so you can put your food there...still no chairs though. They also got a new fridge for drinks by the ordering counter. Their takoyaki are big, fluffly and they don't skimp on the octopus. I always inhale them so quickly because they are inexplicably good.
Dolicris L.}Bronx, NY}2}13}3}-1}5}6/21/2014}Came here with a friend to check out some stores and after reminding myself of the area and what it had to offer, I got curious about this place and I wasn't disappointed. The food was filling and delicious and tasted very authentic. My favorite was the takoyaki, they were worth the price both in size and quality. I highly recommend this one to anyone who's into Japanese cuisine.
Tiffany L.}New York, NY}121}1085}2}18}5}6/20/2014}Hadn't been to this place is ages, but when my bff came into town we made sure to hit this new(er) location up. We got our customary takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (love how it's mostly cabbage - feels so healthy!) combo order and enjoyed them on the bench outside. No seating indoors - strictly a to-go place. Food is every bit as good as what you'd get in Japan. Yum! One of my favorite cheap eats in the city.
Angela N.}Brooklyn, NY}1}3}0}-1}5}6/16/2014}This has been my go-to-takoyaki place for years. They are so amazing I wouldn't go anywhere else for them. Every now and then I will get something else from the menu but the takoyaki is a must. Heads up, if you don't like ginger I do not suggest the okonomiyaki because its just cut in tiny pieces and thrown in there. However they do make them to order so many you can ask to omit it. Not sure, never tried. Finally, just cause I need to vent, I kinda miss the small 3 people maximum occupancy Otafuku used to be. Their expansion feels like betrayal. But I will forgive because I need my takoyaki.
Lisa L.}Staten Island, NY}14}13}0}-1}5}6/16/2014}Before you eat here there is something you need to know. If you eat here once, you WILL get random, severe, cravings for the rest of your life. Otafuku has traditional Japanese street food and is best eaten hot and fresh. The sauce they use is just right and so flavorful. I don't know how to describe how much I love this place. The only problem is that there is not much room to sit and eat. Now that they moved they have a narrow table against the wall for customers to stand and eat, but that can only fit at most 4/5 people. They also have a bench outside, but both are not reliable if you go in at their busier times. For vegetarians, you can get the okonomiyaki and just ask for no meat! or the medetaiEverything is cooked and so amazing. It's a little part of Japan in New York and definitely worth a try. Your eternal loyalty will come after trying.
Peter Y.}Brooklyn, NY}618}636}415}-1}5}6/12/2014}I've visited Japan once in my life, and as such, that obviously makes me a connoisseur in all things Japanese. Having said that, the takoyaki at Otafuku is among the best I've ever had (ok, I honestly haven't had too much, but this place is amazing).Otafuku basically serves fresh, traditional Japanese street food in fast food speed with restaurant food quality.I highly, highly recommend their takoyaki. If perfectly-fried-crispy-octopus wrapped in melt-in-your-mouth-warm-batter doused with a light-yet-sweet-sauce isn't your thing, then I suggest avoiding food in general.Oh, and everything is super cheap, so let the hype train continue!
Hea S.}McKinney, TX}93}77}27}-1}5}6/8/2014}Love this place. It is a must stop by place for my husband and I whenever we come to the city. Takoyaki and medetai is our favorite. Never had this good takoyaki. Its soooooooo delicious~ One downfall is that its jsut a take out place so u cant really seat anywhere to eat. We usually eat outside somewhere side of a building. When there is a long line of customers you do have to wait like 40 min for food and there r no place to wait.Its just a small take out place. BUT!! The food itself makes up for negatives. =)
Peter K.}New York, NY}69}963}46}18}5}6/5/2014}This little Japanese snack place is Awesome! Right in the middle of New York City's Japantown. Small, and not the most bar seating, but it's mainly take-out. The Takoyaki and okonomiyaki are fantastic.
Geekar L.}Brooklyn, NY}96}326}1256}18}4}6/5/2014}I loved this place since it was a hole in the wall. Remembering the good old times when there was barely enough room to place your order. Now, there is more standing room, upgrade! Anyway, I only came for takoyaki this time around (as I always do). I brought my friend here because she has never tried takoyaki, she loved it. It is exactly as I remember it, texture and all. Service was quick and a lot friendlier than before. I'm a slow eater as all my friends tell me so we decided to eat on the go. We sat down by the benches and it started drizzling so we took out our umbrellas and I carried on eating, still good! Afterwards, my friend wanted to go back and get another order for a snack later in the night. I recommend giving this place a try, love it or hate it, at least you know you gave them a chance!
Jack F.}Dallas, TX}556}1045}812}18}4}6/3/2014}So much for the hole-in-the-wall eatery.  I miss the original takoyaki shack when I last visited in 2010 but I'll learn to love (okay - acquiesce) to the modern make-over that is now Otafuku.  Otherwise, the food is exactly the same delicious treat that I remember so fondly.  Surprisingly, even the Combination B remains $9.00 after all these years.  I reiterate my original Cliff Notes: Otafuku offers that wholesome goodness of Japanese street food in that grab-and-go manner. [Last Visit: May 2014]
Hea O.}Irvine, CA}1}27}0}-1}5}6/1/2014}Tasty Japanese Street food!  Cheap too & not oily!ordered combo of takoyaki & okonomi $11.  Japanese pancake &  octopus balls. Cash only.
Kimberly D.}Manhattan, NY}35}70}33}-1}1}6/1/2014}Not worth the hype. I don't know why it is so high rated. I was so excited to come here last year because of the reviews and it was on TV even.  Honestly I wasted my money. They tried to give me excuses why I didn't like it.  Like because "I am not Asian" and "it's not under cooked that is how it's supposed to be."They pre cook all the chunks of octopus and then put it in the takoyaki batter. The octopus was way way over cooked. It was en edible rubber.  And then the balls themselves were undercooked and batter was still using from them. Just all around horrible. The sake bar in Midtown Hagi makes amazing takoyaki that is the best place for it.  Maybe that was an off day but the little building seemed to be run by rude young asian boys just out of high school.  I am not going to waste my money here again when Hagi sells everything they do plus other street Japanese street food and is actually cooked perfectly.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}5/31/2014}Love their takoyaki, okonomiyaki and yakisoba! The best Japanese street food place in the city, as far as I know. The portion is quite generous as well. The only problem is that there is no seating area in the store (only a small bar where you can stand and eat, but it could fit 4-5 people max, as well as a small bench in front of the store). So I recommend that you just take the food to one of the benches in front of Cooper Union, which is only a block away. Also, it's cash only!
Tulsa H.}New York, NY}355}220}78}-1}3}5/28/2014}This is something to try just once, after following the word-of-mouth advertising on forums. Food is okay. Maybe $10 for a "combo" per person. I don't think the taste was anything special though. The service was fine.
Jamie T.}Shalimar, FL}0}4}0}-1}3}5/28/2014}Otafuku used to be the jam. I would frequent them every time I visited the city because they had the best takoyaki I've tasted outside of Osaka. Upon finally moving to NYC, I was excited to make Otafuku my first stop, but was disappointed by their new location. It seems like the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I got the takoyaki/okonomiyaki combo for $10.50. I could be wrong, but I think it was only around $8 at the old place. Anyway, underwhelming this time around. My takoyaki was overly gooey in the middle, and the octopus was scant. The okonomiyaki was super bland and also underdone. I'll give them another chance, because I really want to love them like I used to. Hopefully I just went on an off day.
Mary O.}Houston, TX}97}226}2418}18}4}5/24/2014}The new shop is brighter and more welcoming in comparison to the old location. There's always a line. There's a bar area for eating standing up. The old bench is still outside. The takoyaki is made with a machine and placed in a warming area. Before someone would flip it with chopsticks. The takoyaki used to be burn your tongue hot, now it's just hot and crisp enough to bite when you get it. I like the okonomiyaki, but can never finish it. They put way too much cabbage. Portions are large and it's not expensive.
James T.}Brooklyn, NY}0}19}0}-1}3}5/23/2014}Like others have said, the quality has dropped since they moved. They use more machines in their cooking process now, and its having an impact on the food --  the takoyaki has a slight off taste now, and the batter for both the takoyaki and okonomiyaki is no longer cooked to perfection. Its still acceptable takoyaki and okonomiyaki though. The yakisoba looked really good and I will try it next time.
Tam N.}Rochester, NY}355}183}527}-1}4}5/17/2014}Otafuku probably makes the best Takoyaki around. The new location is a lot larger and actually has counters if you wanted some space for a quick bite. If you don't know what Takoyaki is, look it up. They're basically delicious balls filled with octopus, topped with a creamy mayo some bonito flakes and furikake.  The lines go quick and the menu is easy to navigate. If you have any questions ask one of the nice people behind the counter. It might be pricey $7 for 6 balls but its worth it.
Joanne D.}New York, NY}43}28}0}-1}4}5/15/2014}Yummy!!! I love the takoyaki here!! The nice gooey center is the best part. The only downside is the price. $7 for 6 octopus balls is pretty steep. Haven't tried anything else, but will come back for takoyaki until I find a better place.
Amanda F.}Brooklyn, NY}75}40}16}-1}5}5/14/2014}The Takoyaki here is better than it was in Asia ;p  This place is one of the things in my mind making me regret having to leave NYC.  NOMM YOU FOREVERRRRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!::voice echoes into the distance::
Priscilla T.}Manhattan, NY}104}580}8}18}4}5/12/2014}Yaaaaaaaaasss... I used to go to this awesome (miniature) taiyaki shop in San Mateo CA (Sweet Breams) and was quite sad there was no such thing in NYC. Lucky for me, Otafuku revamped their menu and now serve delicious, delicious full-size taiyaki.For those of you who are confused: it's a fish-shaped pastry (crepe/pancake batter) filled with a yummy ingredient (red bean, Nutella, banana, etc).Anyway, they are golden-delicious, hot, fresh, fluffy, and sweet. Huzzah!Pro-tip: ask for a fresh taiyaki batch - it's worth the 10 min wait.
Viktoria L.}Brooklyn, NY}60}7}3}-1}5}5/9/2014}I just love this place.It's been 4 years, and still in love with it.They are the best:)I never wrote a review so I though it's time.I just went 2 weeks ago, and was shocked they moved.I mean still in the same street and but a bigger place.It looks nicer and you can eat inside now.:)
Jane L.}ASTORIA, NY}33}182}921}-1}4}5/6/2014}Best takoyaki place in NYC. Very authentic. Made fresh every time. Now they have taiyaki as well. New location, bigger, but still no seating, only countertop.
Ratna M.}New York, NY}18}89}195}-1}3}5/4/2014}I was surprised they moved n got bigger place!! But it's nice!Now the food. I feel like it's more expensive now. I ordered the combo takoyaki+okonomiyaki shrimp. Hmm a little disappointed they used to taste way better. The takoyaki is a little too doughy, n it's kinda tasteless inside. I had to ask for more sauce. The okonomiyaki was tasteless too. So sad.Then I also got the medetai, Nutella n banana. Wow.. So expensive, $3 for so tiny n the banana inside wasn't good, wasn't sweet at all.What happened?! The hole in the wall was tiny but the food tasted so much better.
Jericho T.}Totowa, NJ}26}13}0}-1}4}5/2/2014}It's a cute place overall. You can see them make all their food right in front of you so the wait doesn't become that bad. I came here one day because I was really craving Okonomiyaki (and was starving). I got the Takoyaki + Okonomiyaki combination and the portions were good, a little large for me, but still satisfying. The only problem I had was that my food was a bit batter-y and mushy in the middle. Other than that the food is pretty decent and the staff is nice.
Tiffany W.}New York, NY}240}275}145}18}3}5/1/2014}Came here to grab a quick lunch to bring back to eat but they took longer than expected.  I would no longer consider it "street food"/ "a hole in the wall" kind of place for waiting as long as I did. A little bit pricey for the food. Portions where decent. There are no seats so you'd have to take it to go. There was no line when I arrived around 12pm but as I was waiting for food it started to form - their service is kind of slow. Onto the food. I got combo B which was the takoyaki and the okonomiyaki. I would say it was okay food - nothing spectacular. It could have been undercooked because it had a mushy texture and bland taste to it. The sauces made it better - but I think I needed more. It was kind of a disappointment. Maybe they just missed the mark on my order :/
Michelle W.}New York, NY}520}1128}48}18}5}5/1/2014}Still the same goodness from when they were a hole in a wall. Just a little pricier, but still the same food you've come to know and love. Moral of the story: get over to this place and order some yaki soba and takoyaki and top it off with a taiyaki.
Jae J.}Allston, MA}1}25}14}-1}5}4/30/2014}Was absolutely stuffed from dinner but the boyfriend insisted that the takoyakis here would be worth it... and they were! Raised their prices, but they compensated with bigger takoyakis than most places. Piping hot when you bite in, and all in all, deliciousss.
B ..}New York, NY}16}277}0}-1}5}4/30/2014}The new location is much more spacious and the quality of the food is still great.
Melissa S.}Manhattan, NY}67}91}10}-1}5}4/29/2014}I can't tell you how much I love the takoyaki...I haven't tried anything else yet, but I just can't help myself!
Will T.}Manhattan, NY}85}129}59}-1}4}4/24/2014}Still a fan. 5 stars if they incorporate my slogan. Same old hole in a wall but a little bigger for y'all.
A L.}Brooklyn, NY}1}19}3}-1}3}4/23/2014}Well, they've raised their price and now charge tax.I've never tried their medetai (taiyaki), so I finally had the chance to. It was already pre made, and when I took a bite of it, it tasted blah. I could hardly taste the red bean flavor and the shell didn't taste good; tasted like soggy and flaky.
Victoria X.}New York, NY}507}539}344}18}5}4/20/2014}This place is so cute! They make the takoyakis and fish cakes freshly in front of you. They use to be this hole in the wall where no one was allowed to stay inside after ordering so I was really happy to see that they had a bigger space.I normally do get the octopus balls from here but being that I just had dinner at union square prior to arriving at this place, I went with the dessert option, taiyaki.I ordered the banana nutella taiyaki and the cook made it fresh right in front of me; granted I had to wait about 10 minutes for it to be cooked from start to finish. So when I got my taiyaki it was hot, delicious and I'm glad they don't skimp out on the nutella.
Jessica C.}Maspeth, NY}190}107}65}-1}4}4/20/2014}I was really happy to hear the Otafuku relocated to a bigger space because their previous location down the block was a tiny box that could only fit 3 people max at one time. This new location actually has space for you to wait and eat insideAlthough they increased the price to $7 from $6, it's not a big deal to me because their Takoyaki is the BEST you will find in the city. It comes in an order of 6 and topped with a whole bunch of sauce and goodies. The Okonomiyaki, Japanese cabbage pancake with your choice of meat, is also good but it doesn't compare to the Takoyaki. The only thing I wish they would change is their business hours to maybe close at 12 or 1 AM. There are so many times that I crave Takoyaki after a few drinks and it's closed. Other than that, it's a great spot !
Li Jia T.}Los Angeles, CA}1}25}14}-1}3}4/18/2014}New spot just a few doors down the street. It's definitely larger and brighter and looks a lot cleaner. However, the last time I went, the cashier was wearing gloves while he took my money, then proceeded to cook the okonomiyaki and put the raw pork on the grill using the same gloves. Someone else ordered a taiyaki, and so he took the taiyaki from the heater to heat it up on the grill in the very same gloves. I'm not sure if all the employees have that habit, but I pretty much lost my appetite watching all of this happen while waiting.
Steven L.}Manhattan, NY}1231}679}3940}18}4}4/17/2014}Japanese Balls! CASH ONLY!New spot just opened up, they moved from the small hole in the wall down the street.Still making some fabulous balls with octopus meat inside.  Prices are $1 more, but still worth it.Space is brighter and bigger.  I no longer have to wait outside for my number to be called, and there are now not one, but TWO benches for me to sit and eat some balls.I would order the combo sets, they tend to be like $1 cheaper than if you buy everything separately.Ordered the Combo A (Takoyaki + Taiyaki (Chocolate and Banana))   Balls were nicely cooked and charred outside, soft inside.  Taiyaki was not too sweet, it was just right.  The store looks a bit more coporate than the "dirty street" hole in the wall that I'm used to, but at least I feel safer knowing they are clean and received an "A" for a clean bill of health from the City.
Peter B.}Marietta, GA}2}28}30}-1}5}4/15/2014}omg...3 small letters that mean so much within the youth culture and trend setters all over the world.  What does 'omg' really mean?  It can mean anything to many, but I can tell you from my recent visit to Otafuku last night - omg cannot possibly describe how good this place is.  They just have it right here.  It is not too big - not too small (now with new location) and just excellent service and quick.  It is so basic really.  It is simplicity in its complexity to deliver the goods.I took a cab from Soho to find this place and I literally walked past it twice.  But once I found it, it was super easy to order and on my way.  Having been to Tokyo previously, it is like they picked up a small Takoyaki stand and brought it to NYC.  Great to have a hot and fresh Takoyaki served with fish scales stacked to the sky.  Grabbed a coffee drink and for $11 I had the most perfect meal and satisfied my Takoyaki fix.Grab a spot near door to eat where you will find a very small shelf and make some new friends as they read the menu.Do not think - keep it simple and just go. Omg, go.
Helen C.}Brooklyn, NY}1}22}14}-1}3}4/14/2014}I was a huge fan of Otafuku before they moved. And I honestly can say that I miss their old place ALOT. I decided to drop by so I can grab a bite of their takoyaki. I ordered the Combo A (Takoyaki + Taiyaki (Red bean)) for $9.80 (plus tax). The takoyaki was a little dry but still taste amazeballs! On the other hand, the taiyaki was dry and did not taste like it was freshly made. It was too sweet and flaky. If you do not want to waste money, avoid combo A. The new place is definitely more spacious and brighter. But the quality of the food change. I am not sure if they bought a new grill to make the takoyaki or not, however, the texture did not taste the same as it used to be...
Janet N.}New York, NY}126}44}2}-1}5}4/7/2014}First learned of this place at a Food Film Festival back in 2011, and I think their octo-balls have gotten even better! Awesome mixture of texture and sauces. Great for a quick bite when in the neighborhood.
Jack Straw S.}New York, NY}40}196}153}-1}3}4/5/2014}Well an institution has moved, not far but it is just not the same. The old place had personality. It had years and years of people stopping here to grab a quick bite and go on the your way. The Takoyaki seemed the same actually seemed better since it was ordered as a combo and it was cooked to perfection. The shrimp Okonomiyaki was just ok and undercooked in the center. Along the edges it was great but the middle was close to raw or just undercooked....you decide.The new place is bigger and has a some counter space to possibly lean on or even eat at(if it's not packed). It is just not the same and lately I am not liking the changes but it is what it is.
Hatsumi T.}Floral Park, Queens, NY}94}182}478}-1}4}4/4/2014}I have been a fan for 6 years. I miss the small vender, but I like new place, too. New place is just less than 1 minute walk fro old place. Please look for a flag outside of the shop.Their Takoyaki is awesome. It is a creamy dough ball contains a small piece of Tako(octopus). Their Takoyaki's outside is crispy and inside is creamy. Takoyaki needs special equipment to cook, so even though I am a Japanese I can not cook at home. I always come here to eat Takoyaki. OkonomiyakiI(savory cabbage pancake with sauce)   and Yakisoba are good as well.Same as old place, new place doesn't have any table and chairs, either, but there is a counter on the wall that some people can eat standing up.  I noticed they changed the menu a little bit. The new menu is Taiyaki(red snapper shaped cake with filling) with chocolate cream or something like that, in addition to traditional sweet red bean paste Taiyaki. I will try next time.
Gina P.}Washington, DC}50}61}6}-1}3}3/28/2014}Eh. I was really hoping to like this place. Niche Japanese street food with limited menu? Typically that is right up my alley! Unfortunately, Otafuku failed to deliver. I ordered the combo (okonomiyaki + takoyaki) with all standard toppings.When I got back to my hotel to eat, I discovered that the takoyaki were fine... but the okonomiyaki was completely raw! As in liquid! My stomach was churning at this point as I imagined the gastrointestinal issues that could make up the rest of my night.I called Otafuku, and to their credit, they remade the okonomiyaki with many apologies. Even so, it was not delicious enough for me to ever return and risk food poisoning again.
Sarah S.}Arlington, VA}34}10}6}-1}4}3/27/2014}Apparently the old place used to be a block away from this new location.  I've never been to the old Otafuku so I have no idea how it compares.This place didn't have any seats to sit and it was swamped with college students.  With that aside, the service was fast!  The takoyaki was made before I even paid, though that could be a bad thing if business was slow.  It was cheap and satisfied my takoyaki craving!Can't say how it compares to authentic Takoyaki made in Japan but it sure beats what I had at Japanese airport.  A little bit too much dough as I'd have liked.  There were some Japanese who came to eat here, so I guess the Takoyaki here would somewhat satisfy their cravings too.Staff were nice and polite (:
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}5}3/22/2014}New location! Slightly larger store. Great, inexpensive snacks as before! Still the best takoyaki in the city!
Kevin Y.}FLUSHING, NY}202}40}0}-1}4}3/21/2014}This was my first time trying Takoyaki and it was pretty delicious.   Its like fried octopus balls topped off with bbq, mayo, and pork grinds.   It's definitely not healthy for you but it sure taste good and its affordable.  No much seating since its a pretty small joint but its a great shop to go to for a quick snack bite.  I would come again.
Stephanie P.}Astoria, Queens, NY}949}1030}25292}18}5}3/19/2014}New location! Oh dear! Super excited to see them expanding, even though I kind of miss their hole-in-the-wall exclusivity - it is awesome to see that business for them is booming! With such delicious food and such an awesome staff, they REALLY deserve it!If you've ever bitten into something and the flavor explosion in your mouth has made you exclaim, "OMGOSH!! THIS TASTES LIKE LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!" then you've probably already been here.So as per a friend's recommendation I decided go on a Japanese culinary adventure with one of my best friends in tow prior to catching up for happy hour.I generally *really* enjoy anything and everything octopus, squid, calamari or just seafood related and was told that I would love octopus filled takoyaki. Being that I'm occasionally 12 going on 20-something I kept referring to them as "octopus balls" and smirking - but I will NEVER smirk again at takoyaki, especially from Otafuku, as they deserve the utmost respect .According to our wise friends over at Wikipedia, TakoYaki is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-basedbatter and cooked in a special takoyaki pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus,tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger, and green onion.Takoyaki are brushed with takoyaki sauce, a sauce similar to Worcestershire sauce, and mayonnaise. The takoyaki is then sprinkled with green laver (aonori - dried up seaweed) and shavings of dried bonito (katsuobushi - ie. Smoked Fish flakes!!!). The bonito flakes kind of remind me of like smoky bacon tissue paper...weirdly addicting though :).The outer shell of these puppies is not too thick, but still strong enough to hold the fillings together and in place - but also soft enough to absorb all the amazingness that was brushed on, poured, shaken and drizzled on.Takoyakis are made in a special grill pan and then brushed with a sweet Japanese BBQ-like sauce, drizzled with an amazing homemade mayonnaise (that was to me reminiscent of a light herbal infused mayo or aioli) and then the bonito fish flakes were dumped on top and viola - amazingness is born.The filling is gooey and with a much more generous filling of octopus (tentacles too!) inside plus some interesting other ingredients like pickled red ginger, scallion, tempura flakes and other yummy things which create a super hot and gooey literal explosion in your mouth. - think "When Harry Met Sally" moment...total foodgasm ;-).I would be super wary about eating and walking with these because of how hot/gooey they are, but I just think food is better consumed and appreciated when standing (or sitting) still with an incredulous look on your face because I couldn't believe how happy my taste buds were.Otafuku's menu is comprised mostly of takoyakis with all sorts of fantastic fillings like shrimp, pork, beef, squid, cheese, plain - etc and Okonomiyaki which is a Japanese type pizza concoction based with cabbage, scallion, seafood and then drizzled with similar sauces as the takoyaki are. Takoyaki's were invented in Osaka, Japan in 1953 by a street vendor and Otafuku prides themselves in serving the real thing and providing us lucky New Yorkers with an authentic Japanese street dining experience :).They are cash only (won't accept $100 bill or higher, but if that's what your rolling around with message me and I'll break your bill :P) so just keep that in mind. There are ATMs nearby too - just come prepared to want to eat everything!. :D
Rebecca C.}New York, NY}280}308}7}-1}5}3/18/2014}Takoyaki balls? (hehe she said "balls") CHECK.Okonomiyaki pancake? DOUBLE CHECK.Cheap, late night eats? HUGE RED CHECK.Otafuku has gotten such a dramatic face lift that my friends and I nearly walked right past it, but noticed a group of youngins on line and figured, "Yup, this is the octopus balls place". Indeed it was, and it was good (and piping hot).
Virginia Y.}San Francisco, CA}1590}1444}4566}18}5}3/15/2014}Definitely the best place for takoyaki in nyc, nowhere else can compare. They also make really great okonomiyaki. Your order is made fresh within minutes. They're cooked fast too, by the time I whipped out my cash, my order was already handed to me! I only wish they had a sit down area but otherwise great place to grab a bite!
Crystal C.}Bronx, NY}4}19}11}-1}5}3/10/2014}Absolutely delicious! I tried the okonomiyaki (ask for the sauce and mayo on top), takoyaki and taiyaki (banana nutella). I can't believe all this delicious food is so cheap. This tastes like Japan itself. Super yummy and affordable. Cash only
Joshel M.}New York, NY}30}71}46}-1}5}3/7/2014}My first time trying Okonomiyaki and after one bite its already taken the place of my favorite food! Who knew a dish made up of like 70% vegetables could taste so gooooodI ordered the pork okonomiyaki, which is okonomiyaki with thinly sliced pork belly cooked on top of it. It's not bacon as many people assume, but it's way better. When asked what toppings you want on your okonomiyaki, always ask for everything (the okonomiyaki sauce, kewpie mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and aonori).The employees always grill the okonomiyaki fresh when you order, so you may have to wait several minutes, but it's so worth it. I've said okonomiyaki way too many times in this review, but what can I say? I am hooked!Okonomiyaki Okonomiyaki Okonomiyaki Okonomiyaki Okonomiyaki Okonomiyaki I also ordered the red bean medetai/taiyaki. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Maybe I'll have better luck with the nutella and banana filled medetai.
Ellen P.}San Diego, CA}61}145}196}-1}5}3/7/2014}Love Love Love! Delicious and amazing Japanese street/fast food for SUCH a great price!!! I'm so glad they opened up a new and CLEANER location because it was kind of grungy before (but I guess it gave it more of a street food feel). The food is so good that I never complained about the small, not-so-clean vibe about it before but now that it has upgraded to a better location I have NO COMPLAINTS.Their menu is simple and small but every item is 110% goodness. I can't pick a favorite off of their menu so just order everything and sample it all! It's cheap enough anyway. Compared to all the overpriced food in NYC, this place is a BARGAIN.
Edmond D.}OAKLAND GARDENS, NY}0}4}0}-1}3}3/4/2014}I havent been here in ages and it's moved several paces from its original location to a bigger, cleaner, and more modern store. Because of that, I feel like this place has lost its touch. No more "hole-in-wall" feeling like you would expect in a side street in Japan and it appears to have no outside window to order from like before.The food is the same as usual: takoyaki, medetai (taiyaki), okonomiyaki, and yakisoba. Same as I remembered... Takoyaki was nice and hot but nothing really to fantasize about but the taiyaki was very delicious because the red bean was absolutely delectable but it may be too sweet for others. Not the best that I've ever had but still good and made fresh on the spot most of the time. The place is a tad roomier with a small stand space for eating. It can probably fit a maximum of 10 people.It's nice that Otafuku has gone and upgraded itself but it has lost all the traditional look it once had which makes it less attractive. Actually had walked past the new location looking for Otafuku because their new location looks like any other store with no striking appearance.
Florence L.}Brooklyn, NY}31}47}105}-1}5}3/2/2014}I love this spot. It has always been a fave since it moved and I have always wanted them to move to a bigger spot. now that they did I am happily going there even during the winter.
Martin W.}Brooklyn, NY}173}591}431}18}5}3/2/2014}Wow!!! Delicious and yummy Japanese fast food. The takoyaki was devoured by me, why cant American fast food be so good and simple. The octopus balls were served quite prompt and were very hot.  The place is small and is standing only at a wall counter. Very bright though and counter guy was real friendly. Just makes me want to come back for more whenever I am in the Village.$$$$$$$$$$$ CASH ONLY
Suanne L.}Brooklyn, NY}199}934}754}18}4}2/22/2014}Otafuku - former hole in the wall of octopus ball goodness has grown up and gone modern. With a bright and organic looking store, the staff cook up takoyaki, okonomiyaki, yaki soba, and now medetai - sweet stuffed pastry in a fish shape. While I am nostalgic for the secrecy of the old Otafuku space, its also cool to watch them expand. Kudos to them! The cold case in the back offer ito en teas and calpico. The small bar on the right side allow people to eat their hot octopus balls with relish, but without getting it down their shirts. And the food? Same as its always been. Awesome, sweet, salty, fresh, and hot.
Sam F.}New York, NY}4}6}2}-1}5}2/20/2014}Come on, who doesn't love okonomiyaki??? Otafuku does it right, the new spot is clean and friendly (though no actual seating), and everything is fresh and delicious, PLUS best takoyaki I've ever had--gotta love dem octoballs!
Pete N.}Haworth, NJ}6}53}0}-1}4}2/20/2014}Okonomiyaki in my opinion is awesome the old store was quite cramped.  I will be going back in the near future to check out the new store.  But be prepared to be hungry cause these balls are Gigantic.
Jinah C.}Flushing, NY}23}34}0}-1}5}2/19/2014}Very delicious instant takoyaki.the size is hugee and okonomiyaki also is very good.Never went to the new location yetBut must be great as before!
Tony C.}Queens, NY}104}263}617}-1}3}2/16/2014}Yum otafuku, home to the great octoballs of the gods. When you think of takoyaki in New York, this is the place. They moved down the block but in my opinion it was better as it was. This is one of the cases where if its not broken, why fix it. Otafuku is now an indoor restaurant so we can hide from the cold now. There is even a wall table that you can put food on. But popularity of this place combined with the limited space results in a traffic jam of people eating, people waiting for food, and people who are just spacing out. Also ventilation is bad so if you plan to stick around for more than 10 minutes, get ready to smell like "insert your name here-yaki."The changes did make the ordering system more efficient and fast but I feel the quality has gone down as a trade-off. Several of my takoyakis were split open and the octopus meat was bland. I liked Otafuku more when it was a hole in the wall. Now its hit or miss and even with the price increase, there is no 100 percent chance of perfect takoyakis.
Elizabeth S.}Arlington, VA}311}460}877}18}4}2/15/2014}I really liked the Taiyaki banana and chocolate hazel nut but I was not fond of the red bean one. For some reason, it tasted really bland and not like red bean. I really liked the Takoyaki - That was amazing, especially during a snow storm. The place is really really tiny...this wouldn't be an issue if you weren't snowed in form a snow storm but if it was a warm summer day, perfect for Japanese style type street food :)
Kyung-Bo L.}Manhattan, NY}1}17}3}-1}4}2/14/2014}Eventhough it is moved from its original location, it still tastes the same. Their takoyaki is recommended. Because of their new interior, it feels more "clean".
Sarah L.}Brooklyn, NY}174}64}65}-1}4}2/11/2014}New location, literally across the street as the poster on their old location explains. 4 stars for the much appreciated added space (they have interior seating now) and the rarity of non-halfassed takoyaki in the city. That being said, the food's not spectacular. Maybe the magic's worn off, but when I begrudgingly surrender seven dollars for six balls of takoyaki, it better be damned good. The food came out much faster than it used to, with you still being able to see all the peeps making your food with their well oiled flat top grills and shiny stainless steel kitchen equipment. +1 Otakfuku stats.The size of the takoyaki's about the same, with a generous topping of bonito flakes, mayonaise, aonori, and takoyaki sauce, all of which were delicious additions. My main problem was with the takoyaki itself. The balls severely lacked octopus pieces and was a bit too doughy. Of course, eating all the components together was pretty delicious stuff, but not as delicious as it could/should be. The saving grace was probably the great crust they got on balls themselves, that most establishments are unable to achieve. A bit disappointed with the takoyaki, I dug into the taiyaki (there's a special combo with an order of takoyaki and taiyaki). For those that don't know, taiyaki's a fish shaped dessert that's made in a similar approach to takoyaki: grill with filling inside. There's a sweet red bean filling in the center. Pretty good. Nothing that shocked my taste buds, but it's always fun eating fish shaped sweets (note: Swedish Fish)Still, Otakfuku has its own quiet, simple charm that makes me want to shove wrinkled bills in their face. Or maybe I'm just an insatiable fattie. Probably a mix of both.
Maximillian B.}Paramus, NJ}23}31}1}-1}4}2/8/2014}Otafuku has really been improved from a stand to a full on walk-in snack shop. It can now fit more than 1 person which is really good. The prices have rose since the reopening the takoyaki is now $7 instead of being $5. The takoyaki still is amazing and tasty. The okonomiyaki is good. The service is very good. If you are ever in need to satisfy your takoyaki craving this is the place to come to.
Tina Y.}WALL STREET, NY}229}268}2984}-1}4}2/3/2014}Brand new storefront just a few stores away from it's old location.New kitchen + More staff = More EfficiencyThis time around, the store is large enough to fit more than three people at time.  They have streamlined their menu to include only three things, Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, and Taiyaki.  Drinks and Daifuku are still available in the refrigerator.There are three stands in the visible kitchen area now, a dedicated area for each item as well as a person manning each station.  They have started to produce large batches of takoyaki and taiyaki.  Now you can walk in and walk away with these two items without waiting.  The okonomiyaki still requires a wait, but it wasn't that bad, since they have a dedicated space to make a lot of them at once if they need to. Now you can really just drop by for a quick snack.
Ellen L.}New York, NY}5}9}6}-1}4}1/28/2014}Good experiences! Takoyaki tastes really good, suggested don't let the staff put too much BBQ sause. I like to put both BBQ and mayo together lol! have to try the taiyaki, if you like red bean!
Nick T.}New York, NY}69}100}257}-1}5}1/25/2014}Same thing, different location, open concept, there's definitely a lot more room to accommodate more people. Same friendly staff, they also have a freezer with prepared foods. It's definitely an upgrade on their part and you can actually fit more than 3 people, come by and visit to see the upgrades you'll love it!

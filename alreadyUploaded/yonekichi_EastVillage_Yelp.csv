Patricia J.}New York, NY}48}33}39}-1}2}4/23/2018}I had the ginger mugifuji and I honestly wasn't a fan . It looked nothing like it did in the menu picture and for 10.80 (burger and drink combo) ,you'd expect it to taste really good but even the flavor wasn't all that great either and it wasn't of value size. Not again for me.
Yuanyi Y.}Mountain View, CA}66}2}0}-1}5}4/18/2018}Been there a couple of times, I like the eel burger and wasabi fries the most. Decent meal at affordable price.
Ijoo Y.}Manhattan, NY}200}56}0}-1}3}4/5/2018}Doesn't taste bad but portions are way too small for the price. I finished in like 3 bites
Nick F.}Buffalo, NY}6}111}39}18}5}2/14/2018}This place is awesome! I found it browsing around looking for a places to eat for my girlfriend and I while on a day trip to the city. It sounded like a cool idea so we decided to give it a go. We met up with a friend and headed down there to the place. Little did we know that it's not a sit down restaurant, but more of a walk up window type setting. However, they had a little enclosed awning due to the poor weather and they were totally cool with us hanging out there to stand and eat. That have an interesting menu of oddities and flavors not often seen or heard of. Out of three people getting three different burgers, we all liked them and no one had any bad things to say. We even tried some burdock sticks and they were a fantastic substitute for fries with our "burger". The earthiness of the burdock rot with the Japanese umami flavors of the seasoning were a perfect blend of savory and filling. They even have a punch card and offer a rainy day special where you eat double stamps. We nearly filled a card from one visit. It's definitely worth the stop if you are in the area and looking to try something new. Reasonably priced, and perfectly filling.
Calvin s.}New York, NY}172}32}32}-1}1}1/27/2018}Super slow and overpriced for tasteless rice burgers that fall apart. Dunno why people go here.
Victoria T.}Watertown, CT}95}69}367}18}5}11/5/2017}What a hidden gem this is! Spotted its colorful lanterns and homey decor from across the street like something out of a historical period fairytale. Drawn in by the ambience, stayed for the fried rice on a stick! Sticky rice with bacon, potato, cheese on a stick, fried golden and topped with a generous sprinkle of curry powder and pool of tonkatsu sauce. It is all the flavors you love of your favorite izakaya in a uniquely corn dog shape while being nothing like a corn dog. Plus, it's gluten free, which is great if you're celiac like my friend with me at the time. Definitely headed back for a rice burger or some mentaiko fries when I'm in the area next. The smell alone should draw in any unsuspecting passersby. The best marriage of Japanese traditional comfort and New York fusion street hipster cuisine.
Pearl S.}Fairfax, VA}474}13}19}-1}4}10/21/2017}This would get 5 stars if not for the wait! I ordered the sukiyaki bun (beef), and it was amazing! The meet is the kind of fatty beef brisket used in many Japanese and Korean dishes, so it melts in your mouth along with the rice and veggies. My friend and I liked it so much, we came back for another one!
Julia H.}East York, Canada}46}395}857}18}3}10/16/2017}found this place by accident when we were exploring the area.Thought it would be fun to try... it was interesting. we tried the salmon burger which was tasty. Definitely a bit small but a good snack...It did take awhile for them to make it though...we had time to go across the street to check out the pet supply store before coming back to get our order.
Chrystina C.}New York, NY}167}84}340}-1}3}9/25/2017}Small. Taste does not justify the small portion at all. It tastes passable but that's it. Left hungry and $9 poorer. A few years ago, this little joint replaced the popular takoyaki place which moved a few shops down the block.  Also during that time, ramen burger was a bit hit at smorgasburg.  Others tried to ride the wave and replicate that novelty. That's where rice burger came in. A mediocre half ass attempt to be "the next big thing." Fortunately this flopped and the ramen burger hype died with it. Why is this store still open? No clue. It's overpriced mediocracy at best.  Not worth it. I almost regret trying it. Steer clear everyone.
Brittany T.}Manhattan, NY}1267}746}1391}18}3}9/11/2017}Saw this interesting stand and thought I'd give it a try.  It's decent, but I can't say I'm a fan.WAIT: There was no one in front of us ordering but it took some time to order because there were only 2 guys working.  They were both making orders for 2 people who had already ordered before us.  By the time we ordered, it took probably close to 10 (maybe more) minutes to get our food.  Let's just say this place seems like it would be quick but if there are people in front of you, it could be a while.ATMOSPHERE: No seating, you order at the window and there is one bench that faces it where you can sit.  I think most people order to go or through take out.FOOD: I could see this as a good option for those being gluten free.  That being said, not all of them are gluten free because some use soy sauce so pay attention to the markings.  The menu is pretty "expansive" with lots of options.  They have their special fries and other specials like a gluten free rice stick.TSUKUNE - it's a chicken meatball like patty with a sweet/salty soy sauce coating.  It has shishito peppers, which are squished and so flat it doesn't even look like a pepper.  Let's just say, not as pictured.  The burger itself is more of an oval shape and is a decent size.  You won't feel stuffed, but you should feel satisfied.  The burger is made of sushi type rice formed into the shape of a burger bun and the outside is a little crispy like the bottom of the bi bim bap bowl or burnt rice.  Some people might like that, but I don't like hard rice that get stuck to my teeth.GINGER MUGIFUJI - Husband got this one, again it looks like thick pork belly slices in the picture but it's these thin little slices.  I think my patty was much thicker so if you want more meat, mine might have been better.  Decent flavor though.FRIES - they recommended the yuzu salt, and I did enjoy the slight yuzu taste at the end.  the fries are thick potato wedges that have a very potato-y taste? Not all are that fried and some were a little soggy but it's a good addition to your meal and with the combo it only costs an extra $2.50 I believe.Overall, an interesting concept and if I was into rice burgers or looking for gluten free options I might come here but otherwise, I'd skip out.
Jessica D.}Brooklyn, NY}419}267}546}-1}2}6/8/2017}There was a lot of hype about the rice burger in the past although it has died down significantly. Came here for a late night snack. I was kinda really excited to try this but I ended up being disappointed.  Saikyo salmon ($9)- 2/5 This was definitely was not worth $9 in my opinion. It just looked like a sad little burger. There really wasn't anything good about this. The hard rice doesn't go with a soft salmon. Potato Wedges ($6)- 3/5 It's $3 for the smaller one. I would recommend the smaller one just to try since they have a couple of flavors. There was a good portion of potato wedges and they were fresh but the flavor I got tasted weird.
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}3}4/19/2017}I don't know when I am going to learn that I shouldn't follow the hype train when it comes to food, because it often disappoints! As was the case with Yonekichi. I really wanted to love it, but I really can't believe I paid $7.50 for what was quite literally a glorified spam masubi, and about the same size. I paid for the specialty combo, because it looked like a good deal, but I probably only got a $0.25 discount given the items that I chose to add on.The tsukune is their special, which is described as a chicken meatball patty. It is wedged between two rice patties doused in a sweet soy sauce and served with a few slices of spicy green shishito pepper that packs a kick. The furi furi fries are pretty much wedge cut fries. They promote the fact that they are fried in rice bran? oil that is supposed to be better and produce and crunchier fry, but I didn't appreciate this. My fries were pretty soggy. I think what makes the fries special are the different flavored salts you can choose from. I chose the plum one and really enjoyed it. I got the salt on the side because I didn't want too much, but ended up using the entire container anyway. :PThe house made lemonade was good, but I wasn't sure why they served it without ice, given the warm weather. I wasn't given the option either.I ate my lunch on the bench because I wanted to eat outdoors, but honestly, eating in my lap wasn't all that comfortable. Everyone else who stopped by took their orders to go. Not sure if I would return even if they did have a seating area though, so I'm not docking stars for this factor - although other Yelpers seemed to find this a huge issue.
Annabel P.}Silver Spring, MD}4}6}0}-1}5}4/8/2017}I've had some amazing meals in NYC but their salmon burger is what I crave the most in the city. It's the perfect meal.
Patty J.}New York, NY}432}38}13}-1}3}4/5/2017}Yeah I also don't know why I'm here, but I had an intense craving for rice burgers the second I walked by so I caved and walked in. I didn't have cash so I ordered their most expensive burger (Unagi) to meet the credit minimum, which if you ask me is quite a rip-off considering some actual burger places charge less. Taste is just okay, but I see a definite improvement from when I came here last summer.... hopefully this isn't a placebo lol. I have hope for this place because ingredients are solid, service is solid, and aesthetic is cute. If it was a tad cheaper I feel like I could be their target demographic but I find it hard to justify coming back.
Lily J.}Sunnyside, NY}232}84}164}18}2}3/3/2017}Veryyy mediocre, be warned. For the price point, these little "rice burgers" are far from a must-try, in my opinion. I ordered the Saikyo (salmon) and the Tsukune ("chicken meatball patty"). Of the two I definitely preferred the Saikyo, which had a nice texture to it. They are fairly tasty and fresh, but so small so they disappear in a couple bites and barely satiate you. Service was pretty quick, and as a sidewalk-facing vendor, it definitely stands out. But I was not impressed.
Zhi L.}Sunset Park, NY}21}9}1}-1}3}3/2/2017}Introduced of this place by an youtube video. I ordered the saikyo salmon with small furi frui fries in wasabi salt. There was nothing special about saikyo salmon. When I bite it, it is just rice and salmon together. The fries were good. It was fried right in front of me so it was very hot when I took my first bite. You can really taste the wasabi favor but you won't get the experience you get from the wasabi paste (which is good to me). One suggestion, when you order saikyo salmon remember to tell them not to add shiso. I was not happy with the price. It was too expensive for a small rice burger.
Carmen W.}New York, NY}111}206}173}18}3}2/22/2017}This place is a must try, but like a try once and never return. It was def a trek for me to come here but it was a "sac-ri-rice" that I had to have. We gotSukiyaki-thinly sliced beef-emphasis on the thin. There was barely any meat on it. Good flavoring though. Tsukune- chicken meatball patty- added an egg- this was my favorite out of the two. Both had too much rice and not enough filling. It's a little rice patty that costs 7-9$! Should be no more than 4-5$. What a rip. The wait for this tiny little burger is also ridiculous. There was no line when I ordered and it still took them about 15min to prepare my order. It is a fairly new and unique concept, so you have people that are on it like "white on rice."
P L.}Brooklyn, NY}2}194}172}-1}3}2/17/2017}A novel take on fast casual onigiri.  The rice burgers are a bit small for the price and could use a bit more taste.  The fries with flavored salt are very very good.  The shishito peppers were a bit flat compared to the fried.  The Yuzu ice tea was bomb.Service is friendly, everything is made to order; overall a bit pricy for the quantity.
Christina W.}Queens, NY}0}9}13}-1}3}1/18/2017}I found the stand to be cute and creative. However, the food was overpriced. It came up to almost $9 and it did not taste as what I had expected. I honestly think rice burger was a good idea but the rice and ingredients in the burger taste better alone.
Daphne M.}ASTORIA, NY}66}247}97}-1}2}1/9/2017}No! Just no! In what world is a 3" diameter rice slider worth nearly $9? Not this one! My use of exclamation points indicates I am upset!The staff is friendly, but that does not make up for the fact that you are literally getting a palm sized slider with a very tiny pile of meat. You can finish this in four bites. Five if you have a small mouth. Are the flavors there? Sure. Does the rice bun miraculously hold together? Yeah, weirdly enough. Is it worth literally $2 per bite? No. And don't encourage this.There was a great foodie article that indicated the price you pay for food at a restaurant is not just for the food, but for the rent of the place, the utilities, the workers' wages, etc. At Yonekichi, you don't get a seat unless you snag one at the single bench on the curb because part of the allure here is the hole-in-the-wall walk-up window. If these are the flavors you want, you can literally get a heaping portion of it as a sit-down meal at any other restaurant in the area. After ordering the (tiny) sukiyaki, I realized I could have just ordered a bowl of gyuudon around the corner instead. The taste is fine, but unreasonable in value. I will give credit to the very high quality packaging, but I'd rather take it on a brown paper towel for $3 less.Complaincomplaindisappointement.
Simon Z.}Manhattan, NY}417}74}64}-1}3}1/3/2017}Certainly seems very gimmicky for very small portioned rice burger for almost $10. Tsukune (chicken meatball) and salmon are most recommended when I asked. I ordered the chicken
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}3}1/3/2017}While the rice burgers are a good concept and the unique patty options are delicious, I can't say that Yonekichi is a place I'd frequent often. The portions are too small and the prices are a little steep for what it should be worth.
Emi B.}Manhattan, NY}144}276}960}18}3}12/10/2016}I come here once in a while when I'm craving for rice burger, because I love the ones in my country. I have tried all the rice burger here, and loved all their taste. The only thing I would suggest is to make the rice bun slightly bigger. The rice is unable to cover/hold the rest of the food and always ended up very messy (also their packaging problem) Also the portion is quite small. The prep time Kaveri long, always a very long long wait after placing order.
Michael Y.}New York, NY}2}4}10}-1}3}11/21/2016}Rice burger is unique and good to eat. If you just want to be trendy and to experience I will recommend but if you truly hungry it is better to find a sushi place.
Cynthia L.}Manhattan, NY}192}746}1300}-1}2}10/15/2016}There's no seating area/table area except for a small bench outside this place. The food here is less than mediocre and is quite pricy. I got the eel rice burger with avocado and runny egg (+$1.50 runny egg). The rice burger was $9. Might I also add, there was tax as well. The total came out close to $11 in change and my my, I expected close to a filling meal but instead got 1/10 of that. The rice patties were so miniscule! Yes, they were adorable - but NO, I was not satisfied ! Also, the eel had a lot of sharp bones in it, which meant it wasn't prepared properly. What I did like about this experience was the close to $2 I spent on this kitty drink that was Apple gingerale (as described by the man behind the shack). It was a pretty good carbonated drink and aesthetically cute.
Ricky D.}Cambridge, MA}0}34}33}-1}2}10/3/2016}Small portion. Not terrible, but also not very flavorful. Credit card limit. Overpriced. There are many much better places to eat nearby- Cha An for instance is absolutely delicious
Peter K.}New York, NY}69}963}46}18}4}9/19/2016}Cool little rice burger "food stall" place in the Japantown section of Manhattan Lower East Side. Just a food stand so no seating. I had the Ginger Mugifuji and buckwheat tea, both good. A little messy if you've never had a rice burger, but normal. Small portions and kinda expensive.
Susan R.}Washington, DC}100}23}26}-1}5}9/6/2016}Love love love! My salmon rice burger was flavorful, juicy, perfectly balanced and portioned. It left me satisfied but not in food coma like most burgers do. I just want more. I'm also a big fan of yuzu flavor so the fries with yuzu salt hit the spot.
Fiona H.}Saugus, MA}27}80}55}-1}3}9/6/2016}I had really high expectations for this place after I saw it being advertised online but it came out to be mediocre. I was traveling New York during busy commuting hours so I decided to walk to this location instead. It was a really far walk but there was no line so I was excited about that. The menu is very small so there aren't too many options. Only 2 people run the shop (it's a very very small shop so having more than 2 would be too much) therefore the food takes a while to be made. There are also no seating besides a bench right in front. The sandwiches are small-portioned too /: The workers are extremely nice but I probably won't walk so far for this place next time.
Pomme W.}Honolulu, HI}0}38}70}-1}2}9/1/2016}Rice Burger!!! It is the name of the food if you wanna try. It is located close to NYU. I ordered 3 items which are Tsukune (chicken meatball), Ginger mugifuji (ginger pork) and yuzu ginger drink. For the first one, once I looked at it, it was pretty dry.  it is not that tasty at all. I guess they forgot to put the sauce. For the ginger pork, the taste is better. For the drink, it was given with food and it took like more than 20 minutes for me to get it. All the ice was melt. The taste was gone bad.
Priscilla C.}Sacramento, CA}169}302}1553}18}3}7/23/2016}Passed by this place many many times and for some reason only decided to try this tonight since I just felt like having a snack. This place is just a shack with an outside bench for you to sit on to eat after you get your order. The outside of the shack is attractive and cute with lanterns hanging, brightly lit in the dark during the evening. So each type of burger is $8 and you can add $4 for combo which includes fries (choice of 4 diff seasonings) and a drink. You can also add a fried egg to your sandwich for $1.25. Burger choices include chicken, pork shoulder, salmon, eel, and a couple of others which I'll post pictures of. We ordered the pork shoulder (sandwich only) and the chicken combo with fries and ginger yuzu lemonade. The pork shoulder meat was really good, tender, flavorful, full of sauce. The rice patty was also really soft which I did not expect (good surprise), but I think it was lacking flavor. Might have been nice if they possibly seasoned the rice even though rice is usually not seasoned. Something was missing about these burgers, but I can't put my hands on what still. I would try another burger again, but maybe if I passed by and felt like having a snack at that moment. I wouldn't come back on purpose just to eat it though. Also, it was pretty pricey for what they were. I feel like $6 for this burger is the max I would pay, but I understand the rent here on this block is probably not cheap. The wrapping of the burger was also very fancy and nice. Maybe they could use a cheaper wrapper and decrease the price for the burgers lol. The fries with the Kombu salt was really good though. Very fresh flavorful fries. That was kind of the best part of the meal. The ginger yuzu lemonade was different and I really enjoyed that too. Can't really describe the flavor because it is really different, but a good different.
Gauri L.}Manhattan, NY}55}73}103}18}4}7/16/2016}Hole in the wall rice burger stand. The Tsukune rice burger was delicious! Very flavorful. I have to admit, it was my first time having a rice burger and I would be interested in trying their other flavors as well. It was a little messy to eat but I think that's expected for all rice buns. Their portions are quite small, so one burger definitely won't fill you up. Also it did seem a bit overpriced ($8.75) for a tiny bun but it seems like they charge for the "concept" more than the food.Important to note that this place has a $15 credit card minimum so having some cash on hand will be helpful. Also there is no seating...Pros: Friendly staff, great food.Cons: Long waits, no seating, slightly overpriced
Shoshanna F.}New York, NY}1}92}0}-1}3}7/16/2016}Neat concept and cute little stand, but just not that outstanding.  The burgers are just rice shaped into a burger bun stuffed with Asian flavored meats and veggies, but they fall apart pretty quickly.  You might as well just get a rice bowl from somewhere else and pay less.  But I do think it's a neat idea with good flavors.  The furi furi fries were just regular potato wedge fries with different flavored salts.  I like the place, but it didn't blow my socks off.  Worth a try, but it's not a regular place to go to when there are so many other food places in the area.
Tom G.}Rutherford, NJ}164}217}2217}-1}4}7/3/2016}Since now I can practically walk Midtown East with my eyes closed I needed new walking grounds to Yelp on, literally. I check my Yelp bookmarks and see Otafuku and Nohohon Tea Room.So I hop on the subway to Astor Place and little did I know the part of town is littered with small shops and restaurants many catering to fast food for people on the go and many of them Japanese.  I felt like I was on a side street in Tokyo.  While walking to Otafuku I see a whole in the wall place called Yonekichi and it only has a bench in front to sit down and eat no table or counter.So I'm looking at the menu and see pictures and these descriptions for Yone Burgers;Sukiyaki - thinly-sliced beef, onion, lettuce, togarashi threadsUnagi - bbq eel, avocado, tempura flakes, shredded egg crepeSaikyo Salmon - kyoto-style miso salmon, pickled daikon radish, shiso, sakura-misoKakiage - onion-kale-carrot mixed tempura, shiso, Akoh saltKinpira - sautéed lotus root, carrot, sesame seed, togarashi threadsGinger Mugifuji - thinly-sliced premium pork shoulder, ginger soy sauce, cabbageTsukune - chicken meatball patty, shishito pepper, Tokyo scallionI got problems speaking English so you can imagine my Japanese but I ask for the Ginger Mugifuji and it sounds like Ginger Muga Fu$^&ker, but the girl at the counter said I pronounce it correctly, OK then it was about $7.Now I made a few other stops and went back to the office and I take a look at what I got from Yonekichi and I see that this burger doesn't have bread buns but buns made of pressed grilled rice.I then realize I didn't catch the word Rice on the menu only the Burger.  I take a bite and its delicious, with these thin slices of meat with a little ginger soy sauce, oh man I clumped it down. Being half Puerto Rican I have steak and rice all the time so this is up my ally. The rice burger was small I would need two or something else with it to call it lunch.Why didn't I eat it before, I would have skipped all the other places and got more goodies from here.  The unplanned part of my trip was the best part, I am definitely going back soon to try not just this burger again but the other ones too with a fired egg and those Furi Fries with Wasbi Salt, Oh...... I can't wait.
Angel N.}Los Angeles, CA}91}220}10}-1}4}7/1/2016}Great quick snack. I don't like how the salmon comes with pickled radish I think it would be much better just with a great sauce. My favorite is the Tsukune -- very flavorful and get with sunny side up egg! The Unagi one kind of falls apart everywhere.
David C.}New York, NY}45}142}62}-1}4}6/21/2016}More of a 3.5 star than a 4 star for me. I got the signature combo and got the unagi rice burger. Got the fries also which had Wasabi flakes sprinkled on them.Overall  I enjoyed the burger, the fries were great.I also came a second time and got the Ginger Mugifuji which is sliced pork with Ginger sauce.  For the price, there just not enough to make you really full, kind of just makes you craving for more!  Just wish the portion sizes were bigger.  Overall enjoyed the food though
Betty J.}Manhattan, NY}0}23}3}-1}4}5/24/2016}This tiny restaurant in east village is perfect for a quick bite . The rice burgers here are great for a quick snack. I do find it a little pricey but overall great experience!
Margo A.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}4}5/23/2016}I have only had the fried potatoes, which are amazing.   Best fries j have had so far in the city.  Wasabi salt is very strong, but very good.  Yuzu is my personal favorite flavor however.  Plain sea salt is fine, but sad compared to the other choices.
Wah X.}Flushing, NY}7}7}1}-1}4}5/21/2016}We ordered one unagi and yukisaki burgers and the wasabi fries. They tasted good, but not exceptional. Fill up our stomachs fast.
Tracy N.}New York, NY}395}32}41}-1}5}5/20/2016}Love shishito peppers! And rice burgers. Tried the beef and salmon so far, will probably be back to try the others :) A great takeaway option.
Emily C.}New York, NY}126}47}2}-1}4}5/20/2016}Always my favorite burger, love the fries with yuzu flavor and my family loves the pickle dog, and now they are accepting credit cards~! Love MOS burger, but Yonekichi is the only place make rice burger in NYC~!
Chris C.}New York, NY}0}19}0}-1}4}5/8/2016}The staff here was very friendly and I liked the burger -- for the price I might expect a little bit more food and flavor.  However, I would certainly eat here again. Ownership should consider adding some fry sauce in the side or a creamy wasabi sauce as an add on to the burger.
Jeff M.}New York, NY}22}14}0}-1}4}5/2/2016}It's delicious. Some people rate this 3 stars cuz they were expecting an actual burger, which is ridiculous. I don't give it 5 stars cuz it's a little expensive for essentially street food. The fries are great but if you don't like a lot of salt, ask for half salt.
Juliana T.}Manhattan, NY}163}207}304}18}3}4/29/2016}Sandwiches with "buns" made of rice; not much of a stretch from the ramen burger. But as a self-proclaimed food fad aficionado, I had to give Yonekichi a try.Firstly, note that Yonekichi is not a sit-down restaurant. Their storefront is an ordering window which opens onto the sidewalk, with one small wooden bench out front. Definitely a grab-and-go joint. That said, their service is pretty slow so you won't be going anywhere too quickly.When I came on a Sunday mid-afternoon, there were a couple people waiting for their orders. I stood at the window for a while before either of the only 2 employees acknowledged me as they were busy chatting with each other (maybe that explains the slow service). When they did notice me, however, they were very friendly and helpful. They even gave me an extra couple of stamps on my newly acquired frequent buyer card.I tried their signature Tsukune (pronounced soo-KOO-nay), the Unagi, and the Kasu soup. The Tsukune was good; chicken was juicy and had great flavors. The Unagi was like a deconstructed eel roll, key word: deconstructed; the saucy eel caused the rice bun to fall apart. By the end of the "burger," I was just eating rice and eel with a spoon out of a bag. And the Kasu soup was just a miso with some added veggies and other Japanese fixins; not great.Overall, cute concept. Worth a try once, but probably not more than that. Anyone want my frequent buyer card?
Primo P.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}4/28/2016}They had out door seating. I'm not a big rice burger aficionado but they're ginger Pork burger and Tsukune is really good! Those furi furi are bomb too. A must go.
Chakhay S.}Clinton Township, NJ}311}35}52}-1}4}4/23/2016}+1 service is very friendly. It had rained and we wanted to sit on the bench but it was wet. The staff came out and wiped it dry for us+1 very clean looking establishment +1 very authentic Japanese flavor in the meat and ingredients+1 not overly filling. A great appetizer place-1 overpriced for the amount of food. I get that it's  authentic and Japanese but if it's a takeout only place the prices is a little high.
Danny T.}Syosset, NY}187}8}5}-1}5}4/9/2016}I had unagi burger and salmon burger. Unagi was tender, sweet, moist. Salmon was soft, flavorful. My favorite is definitely the unagi one cuz i love unagi.
Claire H.}Manhattan, NY}571}101}40}-1}5}4/6/2016}Yonekichi is (literally) a hole in the wall spot near St. Marks Place. There are no tables or anything (just a park bench across the window) so don't visit intending to have a full-on restaurant experience. It's more akin to a food truck or booth if anything. They're also CASH ONLY, so hit up an ATM beforehand. My favorite rice burger is the Tsukune with an egg. It always hits the spot and though it's on the pricier side, I'm always willing to fork over the cash because it's just that good. Plus, it's the only place I know of right now where I can fulfill my craving of a good rice burger. The fries are also really tasty. The salts are SO interesting and unique - I highly recommend at least giving them a try. I went to Asia a few months ago and tried MOS Burger, a Japanese franchise, while I was there. It's pretty similar to Yonekichi (in fact it was probably the inspiration). Food-wise, Yonekichi feels/tastes fresher and I personally think it's better. Price-wise, MOS Burger definitely wins, but when you've got good food in NYC, there's always going to be a bit of a premium.Anyway, go check it out. I think it's worth it.
Anna T.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}2/29/2016}One of my favorite inconspicuous spots in the east village. Their rice burgers are amazing! Get the sukiyaki (beef. hands down, the best one.) And get the fries, with Yuzu salt. You will not be disappointed. If you like spicy roe, get the side of sauce and dip the fries into it. So good! And the lunch special during the week is unbeatable for the price. Around $8 for the rice burger and fries, depending on the type of rice burger. The burger tastes really delicious, the rice is warm and packed into the form of a patty and the meat has so much flavor and juice that you'll be licking the wrapper it comes in when it's over. They have vegetarian and vegan option burgers too; those come with veggies.
Sarah L.}Falls Church, VA}145}443}530}-1}4}2/27/2016}I make rice burgers at home from time to time and they can be tricky to make. You have to use the right kind of rice, shape the bun just-so, and the binder is just potato starch. I also cheat and wrap mine in lettuce or seaweed to maintain its shape. I've never tried another rice burger other than my own, until today. It was bitter cold out and the surrounding restaurants were busy. While waiting for our table at Cha An, we ordered and cosumed the rice burgers at the takeout window. The burgers were hot and piping, but man, did they hit the spot! I had the Ginger Mujifuji and my boyfriend ordered the Saikyo Salmon, which is gluten free. The Furi Furi Fries were potato wedges with your choice of gourmet salt.  They were crispy and deliciously creamy with each bite. While the price point is not ideal, they have a frequent punch card for loyal customers. Let's be real--rice burgers are never going to be the next taco but they are nice and filling and more varied than eating onigiri (rice balls). Unlike rice balls they can be messy to eat. Since my boyfriend is gluten and yeast sensitive, sometimes he can't have a gluten free bun without feeling sick, and lettuce wraps get old. Rice burgers provide more options. Glad we were able to give this place a try!
Mary H.}Brooklyn, NY}10}8}8}-1}3}2/23/2016}Wait was a bit long considering, 1. it looks like a quick grab and go sort of joint, 2. there was no line. Overall the burger was tasty but kind of difficult to eat as it kind of came apart between the rice and the large piece of lettuce and meat that doesn't tear out of a sandwich well.
Sab Y.}Staten Island, NY}1}15}2}-1}4}2/23/2016}Can get a little messy, but overall great taste and unique!!! It's definitely worth a try so if you're ever in the area, give it a shot!
Thomas M.}Brooklyn, NY}102}315}135}-1}3}2/2/2016}I want to love t his more. I love rice, and I love burgers. But Yonekichi doesn't quite serve either. Yes by the most basic definition it is a burger: meat in between two buns. But the rice portion isn't quite solid (begins to fall apart towards the end of your meal) and the beef burger didn't quite have enough meat.Checking in at $8+ per burger, the expectations are high and unfortunately I would have to say that the burgers are just a novelty. What I did really really enjoy was the Tatsuta fried chicken skewer. Well fried chunks of dark meat generously seasoned with red pepper powder that even gave me a kick. Buyer beware : the spicy is more than "a little spicy" as the guy claims. It's very, very spicy. But man was that chicken skewer good.
Kenneth R.}North Chicago, IL}106}8}13}-1}4}1/31/2016}I was in the area and the storefront caught my eye, so I decided see what they had to offer.  They specialize in rice burgers and since I had never had one I thought it would be worth a try.  I got the salmon rice burger.  The sticky rice complimented the juiciness of the salmon perfectly.  It is a little small, so if your looking for a complete meal this might not be the place.  If you want a unique food item and are looking for a light snack to keep you satisfied then this is the place to go to.
Zi L.}Staten Island, NY}16}5}1}-1}2}1/4/2016}This is my very objective opinion. Take it as you will, since everybody has different taste. But keep in mind I am an Asian food loverThe pros. - This is the only rice burger joint in nyc- the fries are good. The cons. -Even tho there was no line, they took nearly 20 minutes to prepare our food. -the only seating area is a small bench-it gets very cold having to wait for the food in the winter-very small portions, pretty expensive - the rice burger was a let down. It lacked flavor and was far too small for something that costed 10$- the soup was downright nasty.
Vicky F.}Tampa Bay, FL}136}455}284}18}3}12/14/2015}Wouldn't go back again- the price is way too high: burger is small and flavorless. Two burgers average of $8/ burger. I had the pork and didn't taste much out of it and my friend's chicken burger had the same feedback. The wait time for the burger to be done is around 10min with no line....Note that this is a window-shop that does not provide indoor seating.
Heide K.}San Francisco, CA}4}6}3}-1}5}11/14/2015}The rice burgers are delicious; buns are sticky rice that's just the right degree of crumbly. And the filling is hot and savory! My fav is the Kinpira, which has lotus root in it. My friend got sukiyaki and that was also great. It takes about 5-10 minutes before your order is ready so be prepared to stand around and wait a bit! Five stars. Definitely coming back if I'm in the area!
Mr F G And Ms M S.}Flushing, NY}668}1041}4009}-1}3}11/14/2015}Unagi burger, that's what we ordered. It was good, for sure. The unagi were soft & flavorful but well, it's a $9 snack. The burger is very small. It's not a burger you want to eat when you're hungry. It's really just good for a snack. The staff here were polite & the food came out pretty quickly.
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}4}11/11/2015}I really want to support innovative places, and I like this concept a lot more than ramen burger. I got the pork with ginger and the yuzu fries and ir eally thought it was super tasty! It was a bit pricey for somewhere that doesn't have seating, but really it hit the spot so i can't complain. Although the rice burger did not hold as well as I thought it would. If it were more panfried, it would've been more delicious. This is a hole in the wall and they ahve a bench outside so I think they re trying to start off like otafuku. They have punch cards and give double stamps for rainy days! It takes a while for hte order to complete since there was only 1 person there manning the station..a little understaffed in my opinion. Would definitely come back and try the other options fi I'm in the area.
Maximillian M.}San Francisco, CA}186}2204}1}-1}3}11/5/2015}The unagi is pretty delicious, if you're in the mood for a $9 snack.
Yi F.}Manhattan, NY}78}28}14}-1}5}10/2/2015}Love it a lot! It used to be the window for takoyaki. Now the takoyaki moved to a bigger restaurant next door. And this one, gives the same best experience of having「street food」on the chair by the street. The sticky rice, soft marinated beef, eggs and the way they wrapped the rice burger, all are very comforting!
Trent M.}Aptos, CA}17}46}19}-1}4}9/30/2015}We practically tripped over this place while traipsing around Greenwich, and we were HUNGRY! Both my wife and I got the ginger pork burger thingy (thinly sliced BBQ pork in a ginger teriyaki sauce between two white rice 'buns').It was so delicious, but the wait was a little long - about 10 minutes of standing there waiting, but worth it.
Kenny M.}Brooklyn, NY}178}39}228}-1}2}9/1/2015}I passed by this place many times before and I always found the idea of rice burgers to be fun & interesting. I finally found a night when I was neither too full to turn it down nor too hungry to opt for something more substantial. One of its kind, Yonekichi has a great burger concept. Their sandwiches made of pressed rice -- not very different from the rice you find at the bottom of old rice cookers. That said, the rice gives the burgers a strange, unique texture; an almost crunchy, sticky sensation on the palate and teeth. The rice bun was a little too sticky on the teeth for my tastes, but otherwise the burger experience was novel, creative and palatable. The Yuzu fries, to my disappointment, tasted a bit dull. The Yuzu salt, though very subtle, almost slipped past my taste buds completely. The fries were super starchy and they  don't offer ketchup with your order, so the meal can get real dry ... real fast. I highly recommend grabbing a drink to help wash down the burger + fries combo. Overall, I felt that my visit was straddling between pleasant and underwhelming. In an era where our phone cameras eat before we do, Yonekichi will satisfy your Instagram feed more than your palate. I would recommend Yonekichi if you're feeling adventurous ... but as for me, a second adventure seems unlikely.
Minto S.}Richmond Hill, NY}147}274}10}-1}3}8/31/2015}I wandered into this place randomly the other day, I love Japanese food so I was excited to try their veggie burger type options.  I ordered the Kaki-age, surprisingly the order took a while.  It cost about $8.44 for what seemed like a small breakfast muffin type item, so the cost did not justify what I got.  The tastiest part of the meal was the spicy sauce that you can get for 50 cents, the kaki-age was pretty bland.  this place really deserves 2 and half stars since their other items look really good and I do want to go back to try them.
Priscilla T.}Manhattan, NY}104}580}8}18}4}8/31/2015}I can't speak about their hero product (the rice burger) but I will tell you that this little shack has chicken on a stick worth talking about. I ordered the Negipon (crispy chicken skewer with scallions and ponzu sauce) and the Fire Togarashi (same crispy chicken except covered in 7-spice shichimi togarashi and garlic). Be warned, the Fire is SPICY but it was all so good that I sat on a bench by myself and ate everything in 5 minutes.Cons: $6 per skewer is pretty outrageous, cash only.
Philippe A.}Munich, Germany}0}1}0}-1}1}8/30/2015}Really surprised about all these good reviews. Unagi and salmon Burgers were flavorless and tiiiiny. With very creative pricing though, at 9 bucks per "burger" ? Wait was longer than 15 minutes at a pick up only fast food shack, this is silly! Definitely never coming back.
Mandy L.}New York, NY}115}623}1591}-1}4}8/18/2015}These little rice burgers are pretty expensive (averaging around $8), but they're so yummy, I wouldn't mind having one as a treat once in awhile.  Clearly, the chef experimented in the kitchen quite some bit because the combo of ingredients for each of the burgers is spot on.  I liked to saikyo salmon which had a shiso leaf in it.  The tsukune burger with a runny egg on top was good too.  The rice has the perfect crunch on the outside and chewy rice underneath.  They make each one to order so it's piping hot when you get it.  But that also means you should only go if you have some time to spare.
Wing L.}Germantown, MD}8}13}5}-1}3}8/14/2015}I had the Unagi burger and didn't like it at all.  Mushy rice and flavorless. They should make the rice more crisper or thinner. Yuzu fries are good tho.
Sanjana L.}Hoboken, NJ}0}3}0}-1}4}7/27/2015}We were on our way to superiority burgers when my husbands ever wandering eyes(only for food!) landed on this little hole in the wall. We decided to sample the kakiage yone burger which was delightful! A little on the oily side (tempura duh) but weloved it.. Will definitely be back soon!
Laura D.}New Providence, NJ}59}16}11}-1}5}7/18/2015}I love this stand.  Food made fresh... find a seat on the bench,  don't worry,  you're going to eat fast.  Though the piping hot grilled rice patty bun may slow you Down a little,  there's no guarantee you'll control yourself.  I don't think one dollar sign is enough... I would add 2. But don't let that stop you. This is a unique find
Tom C.}New York, NY}102}216}291}18}3}6/28/2015}Small hole in the wall Japanese rice burger joint. Love their tsukune topped with egg. They are made to order so it takes a some time. A little pricey for what it is.
Bing R.}New York, NY}133}457}2665}18}3}6/24/2015}Good concept.Instead of a bun, or bread, they made patties out of rice and fried it and put the chicken or pork or salmon between it. Kinda like a giant round Onigiri without the seaweed and more filling in it.I wish it was better seasoned.  The pork and the salmon had more flavor.  A bit pricey for a flat chicken "meatball".  Although the chicken did have a good ginger flavor.  Maybe it ought to have more sauce to too not with.
Al S.}Houston, TX}9}12}1}-1}5}6/18/2015}The two most popular dishes, and recommended by the chef himself - who is Japanese, are the Tsukune and the Salmon rice burgers. The Salmon burger was a bit salty from the overloaded miso topping, but I do have a sensitive tongue compared to others. The Kimpira burger was really good in my opinion. It's a unique experience, albeit the price leaning on the expensive side and its cash only restriction, but it's a must try! It seems like a new establishment and I hope it gains traction!
Amir M.}Greenwich, CT}0}5}0}-1}4}5/26/2015}Excellent rice patty sandwiches that I would recommend for on the go when you want a tasty bite for under 15 bucks.
Chrissy M.}Brooklyn, NY}18}53}348}18}4}5/26/2015}Loved the staff and the food was great! I went during lunch time and the wait time was over 15 minutes, a little pricey but was worth it. FYI CASH ONLY !!
Sora A.}Flushing, NY}266}93}175}-1}3}5/20/2015}Passed by this place many times before and thought it was interested so decided to take some home one night. Maybe because I didn't eat it right away, it wasn't all that great. Got the original chicken patty burger, pork shoulder, and the beef but they were all just blegh. Too much rice, not that much meat or veggies. And it was also pretty expensive considering it to be street food. Don't recommend
Jason T.}New York, NY}602}14}1}-1}5}5/15/2015Updatedreview}I have now been going here occasionally for the past 6 months and am upping my rating to 5 stars. I love this place. Its super Japanese with tons of  Japanese flavors and touches. Yuzu or plum salted fries are an example. And nice details in everything that Japenese are known for from way your food is packaged to the consistency of the slightly crisp rice bun. This place is best when you eat it straight off the grill since the rice bun has a slightly crisp texture, but I also like to order for delivery sometimes. Everything tastes clean and simple and it makes for a good neighborhood staple. My favorite burger is the Beef Sukiyaki Yonekichi burger with Furi Furi fries. The new Tatsua chicken skewers are great too. I tried the Fire Togarashi which was super amazing with lime on it. And for a vegetarian option the Kakiage burger is amazing. And not sure why people in the reviews are having such a hard time eating it. You just hold it in its paper and you will do fine!
Alvaro C.}Brooklyn, NY}2}10}2}-1}4}5/9/2015}My girlfriend and I were wandering around St. Marks, still heartbroken over the loss of Japadog last year, when we ran into this place.It's a nice little place with great Japanese sgyle rice cake hamburgers. I had the chiken meatball patty with fries. It was very flavorful, the chicken patty, well cooked and seasoned. I also had the fries with a type of salt that gave it a kind of a lemon flavor, I can't quite recall the salt type, but it was delicious. All the flavors complimented each other and was surprisingly filling for it's price.There are only three things that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. 1- It's a bit pricey.2- A relatively long waiting time.3- Just a nitpick, but it's cash only.All in all, it's a great little place you can get some good and different food.
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}4}5/9/2015}Can tell this is really a hot place given the long line outside waiting for their order. Definitely gonna try it the next time, when I'm still hungry!
Debby T.}Manhattan, NY}0}55}18}-1}2}5/8/2015}I hate to give this two stars....I love the idea of yakigiri with anything.  I had the salmon, which was tasty, but for $9.80?!?!  NOT worth it at all!  It's actually a crime how much Yonekichi is charging, but then again, we know how rent is too damn high in NYC. For $10, I could have gone to Eons and gotten dinner for tonight and tomorrow.  Disappointing.
Nathan C.}Elmhurst, NY}30}215}72}18}2}4/28/2015}Disappointed. Can't even compare with Mos Burger.
marie h.}San Francisco, CA}1}79}89}-1}1}4/26/2015Updatedreview}We got the salmon and it was ok and nothing to get again.  But they were also rude.  We weren't offered a frequent punch card and the japanese way of handling money on a tray was not the service we received.  Both services provided to the person who ordered after us.  No need to go back to a place that does not treat customers equally.  And I'll be sure to spread the news.
George C.}New York, NY}0}7757}14306}-1}3}4/23/2015}Ordered pickup via Grubhub of an Atkins-killing order - Furi Furi Combo (Ginger Mugifuji Burger, Plum Kombu-Cha Salt and Sansho Pepper Furi Furi) for $10+tax. Nice guy working the place, but the only staffer, a recipe for frustration for the other 10 people waiting with no sign of their orders even being taken, let alone cooked. Satisfying enough meal (all fries should be dusted like that), but don't see a reason to return, especially if there's a wait even if you order ahead...more gimmick than craveable.
Rhea R.}Manhattan, NY}23}15}39}-1}4}4/8/2015}SO GOOD, I got the eel one and it tastes like eel over rice in bite size. The portion is small, it's about a half of a McDonald burger. You need to order two if you are really hungry, which makes it kinda expensive(9 for one burger). It definitely tastes good tho.
YuQuan T.}Brooklyn, NY}165}51}44}-1}3}12/20/2014}the burgers wasn't bad.  the price were decent. my problem was that I took it back to the office to eat it. the burger being wrapped up for a while made it soggy and fell apart very easily.  it's really meant to be eaten on the spot.
Maciek M.}New York, NY}48}43}15}-1}2}12/18/2014}Sorry, but friendliness and cleanliness can't quite compensate for the gimmickness of this enterprise.Too much rice (it's a bun), too little stuffing.It's just a gimmick, a fad, a cronut of a burger.But then again it's New York and fads and gimmicks are what propels this city.
Jorge O.}México, D.F., Mexico}117}182}220}-1}4}11/11/2014}It's hard to be surprised by randomly stumbled-upon food hole-in-the-walls in New York City after 5 years of roaming this specific area (both by foot and online) in search for the ultimate lunch spot. Yonekichi surprised me.Disclaimer: the place is SMALL. It's just a counter on the wall, actually. May be unsuitable if the whether isn't good bc/ you have to eat out. CASH ONLYI'm happy with the food. Very happy. Lightly toasted rice buns? Yes please. Vegetarian tempura patty? With a sunny-side-egg? Hell yeah! That tasted great :) Wait, there's more! Yuzu-salted fries (called "furi furi" potato wedges) -- interesting and good.Ok, not sure if it would fit, but perhaps some sort of veggie toppings and/or some sauces could potentially improve these sandwiches. At least people would get to customize them more. But don't get me wrong, I think they're great as they are.I do wish they had MORE vegetarian options though. Another weird thing was that my amount to pay was $10.07. Really, 7 cents? I hate when that happens because I don't like carrying coin change except quarters some times.Price-wise, I think they're on point, but don't expect particularly large portions. Last, I noted the staff may be a bit inexperienced, at least the cashier was a little slow, but I suspect they're new, hopefully they'll get more acclimmated soon.
Diana T.}LITTLE NECK, NY}65}149}50}-1}2}11/11/2014}I love the concept- cute little Japanese food stand serving up something unique- rice burgers. Perfect for a late night snack. I guess I'm just not so crazy about the tasteless rice patties that are too soft and don't hold together. We tried the tsukune burger, and the Ginger mugifuji, with yuzu salted fries. While the fillings tasted lovely, I'd much rather have it over a nice bowl of rice. The yuzu salt might work better on shoestring fries instead of the wedges. The burgers are also rather small for the stated prices. Overall, underwhelming.
Alice W.}San Francisco, CA}277}84}7}-1}4}11/3/2014}I'd give them a 4.5 if I could. I think the only drawback is the wait, but the food is frigging delicious.
Cynthia D.}Queens, NY}454}803}5869}18}3}11/1/2014}Overall, the rice burgers here are pretty tasty but certainly not worth the price you will be paying for them.I got the Unagi Rice Burger and Sukiyaki Beef Rice Burger to share with my friend. Unagi Rice Burger was a bit of a disappointment. It does that have sweet-smokey eel flavor, which even packaged eel has but no complaints about that because I do not mind. The mix of avocado and shreds of egg crepes (tasted gingery) really did not work out for me. Sukiyaki Beef was actually pretty good. It is very well marinated, saucy, and flavorful. The rice patties really did not have that crunchy taste I would like it to have. The burger fell apart very easily because it was way too soft. For the price range of $6.50 to $9.00 a burger, I felt that the burgers should have been a lot bigger and with more ingredients included. The burger was not well put together, hence, falling apart after each bite. I think a fork would be useful, in this case. There is no seating except for the public bench just directly outside of this spot. From ordering to picking up your food, it takes a while. Lastly, it is cash only.Mehhh.
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}3}10/31/2014}I think this place has potential, but is so far off the mark.  The ratio of rice to filling is just way too high, especially at the prices they're charging.  C'mon, just give us a little more meat in there and I'll be happy.  With that being said, I do like the texture of the rice, I feel like I'm eating the best parts of bibimbap...
WenQi T.}Flushing, NY}17}43}243}-1}4}10/27/2014}A cute and cozy store in St. Marks. There's only a bench outside for customer only. I've been waiting to try out this rice burger for month. They only make your order after you pay so this is good which guarantee the freshness of your own little rice burger. Did a little research before today, really want to try their chicken meatball sake miso soup thing, but was unfortunately sold out.    We only ordered one chicken meatball rice burger and the pickle cucumber. Only an extra dollar for the pickle cucumber in this combo set. Sold for 1.75 each if separate. The wait time was a little long but if they make it fresh for you, there shouldn't be any reason for complain.      The rice burger came out so hot and smelling amazing. I couldn't take a full bite because it was really hot. The rice burger itself was kinda loose and moist which made it falls apart pretty easily if you just try to get a full bite and squished the whole thing. The chicken meatball was DELICIOUS. So juicy, tender, flavorful! I would just buy the meatball itself if they decide to sell them alone! Please do that~~~ This shisito pepper is not supposed to be spicy but the ones in my rice burger was spicy and I don't really eat spicy food. It came as a surprise to my mouth and I got no choice but to spit it back out.     The pickle cucumber was packaged nicely in a clear plastic bag. But be careful with the packaging since there might still be liquid in the bag and get drip on you which almost happened. It was truly a Japanese style pickle. Not sour if that's what you think when you hear the word pickle. The cucumber was really crunchy, savory, slightly sweet and refreshing (and smoking - bf's impression). Love it! A great way to kill any heavy or oily feeling from the burger. Plus, it's seasonal and only 30 of them for each day - so be sure to get it early!
Anastasia W.}San Diego, CA}121}396}90}-1}2}10/27/2014}This a little grab and go counter that has a bunch of different rice burgers to choose from.  We went during the middle of the afternoon and there wasn't a wait, but I can see if you did have to wait, it would be frustrating as you'd have to stand outside (just a small vestibule area big enough for 2 ppl max).  Tried the ginger pork rice burger. The flavor was similar to a tonkatsu sauce, or japanese bbq sauce with some ginger.  My only complaints:1.  It was much smaller than expected (especially for the price)2.  It was falling apart - there was too much sauce, which was soaking into the rice, everything sliding all about, the rice started to come apart on the sandwich.  I really didn't get to take time to enjoy the sandwich because it was so messy i had to scarf it down or risk losing half on the street. It was ok, but I don't think I'll go back unless there are no other options in the area. For that price, I could go down the street to a place where I could sit inside and have a substantial meal that fills me up.Also, CASH ONLY (as of this writing)
Alexia B.}Paris, France}2}15}13}-1}5}10/26/2014}* * A M A Z I N G * * So unusual & surprising... But in a good way! I took the Salmon Burger, it's marinated in a delicious sauce... And for $10, there is a lot of salmon, and the products they use are very good quality products. It's so good, it's like eating Japanese Teriyaki on rice, but in a funny way!Just one advice: I was curious so I wanted to try the fries too, but it doesn't go well with it... It would be like eating Teriyaki with potatoes... Useless! The burger is so amazing, you don't need more!And the people are nice, small kitchen you can chat with the cooks : One word then: you have to try it!
Takuya S.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}10/25/2014}I love Yonekichi!!Off course I like thier rice burgers,but my favorite is thier french fries.(Furi Furi potato)I guess they use very clear and good oilfor fries.When I usually eat french fries in any other place,most of it is greasy and heavy.but I don't feel it about Yonekichi'sone.I also recommend their side soup.It is tasty and hearty soup in cold season.
Yoshinobu S.}Manhattan, NY}14}3}0}-1}5}10/22/2014}I really love Yonekichi!I tried everything on menu but all of them were really good! but little bit pricey. My favorite is Kakiage! But if you order with Unagi sause instead of just sea salt. Ask them to put Unagi sause!! It's so much better!!! I'm gonna have some rice burgers tonight too!! haha
Bunny B.}New York, NY}92}95}296}-1}4}10/20/2014}After waiting 30 minutes (yes I checked the time printed on my receipt, I waited 32 minutes to be served), I was super hungry. It was frustrating to see only one person in the back kitchen assembling the burgers as the friendly lady in the front took orders. That aside, my saikyo salmon burger was on point with an interesting and balanced miso glaze and punchy whole shiso leaf. They serve a quality piece of salmon cooked through perfectly on the med-rare side and my added egg topping was just the right level of runny goodness. The rice bun could have been roasted a bit more, it was similar to the crusty bottom of bibimbop and did a fair job absorbing runny yolk. Grab napkins, you will want to carefully scarf this stuff down on the spot outside. Would I invest 32 minutes and $11 to repeat the experience? Yep! Though I hope they work out the kinks to improve efficiency soon.
Nuna C.}Manhattan, NY}117}165}162}-1}3}10/12/2014}I wanted to like this place badly but it's really just construct a rice bowl into a sandwich which is a novel idea but the taste profile isn't there.  Too much generic Asian sauce that completely coated and overwhelmed the "sammy".  Couldn't even really taste the pork within.  Unfortunately I wouldn't revisit but it MIGHT be good as an anonymous salty piece of food after a night of boozing.
Susan V.}New York, NY}6}151}10}-1}4}10/5/2014}The chicken meatball burger was so tender and juicy. Delicious. I was for some reason never a fan of sushi rice and chicken. Don't ask, it makes not sense but the combo to me was off putting. This made me reconsider.
Jin H.}Manhattan, NY}2}56}0}-1}5}10/5/2014}I always complain about how come a mighty city like NY has no Mos Burger, which is a Japanese fast food chain known for their rice burgers. Finally, we got Yonekichi. If you miss Mos Burger, you should definitely go to Yonekichi: their sukiyaki burger tastes just like the one at Mos!
Nilsa L.}Brooklyn, NY}56}262}285}18}5}9/27/2014}I heard about the opening of Yonekichi on UrbanDaddy and have been looking forward to try it out. I didn't realize looking at this address that this is the same spot as the old Otafuku! I guess it's so new that they have a small sign that instructs people to walk down the block for Otafuku. While waiting for my order, people would walk up asking about the "balls" and the cashier would direct them to walk down. It looks like a very clean and simple spot. I like the fact that they cook things fresh on the spot instead of just pre-cook everything and then assemble them when ordered. Yes, it does mean a longer wait, but it just taste so much better considering also the ingredients used. Who wants re-heated salmon, eel, and rice?I decided for my first try to get the salmon rice burger and fries. I LOVE salmon, so there was no way I would skip that one. Now that I've tried it, I may never move on to the next one. The salmon is marinated in miso and it also has a dollop of miso sauce with a slice of daikon radish. I love miso marinated salmon and cod, so this was right up my alley. I had to take out the daikon. Never into pickled vegetables. The burger was cooked very well. It was really flavorful and a good piece of salmon. The rice burger was soft enough but at the same time it's not mushy like it's over cooked rice. It still maintained its individual grains. The top was slightly seared but it wasn't too chewy where the rice was stick in your teeth or create an uncomfortable crunch with the rest of the ingredients. But as a salmon lover, I love this burger too much. I really may not be able to move on to try the others. Along with the burger, I also got a small order of the furi furi fries with yuzu salt. This reminds me of the "shake shake fries" I used to get in Hong Kong's McDonald's but only better quality fries. I liked the yuzu salt. It wasn't too over powering. I would be back to try the other flavors. The only gripe I would have is about the price. It is somewhat steep to charge the salmon burger for $9 and a small fries for $3. But this would definitely be a treat once in a while when I'm in the neighborhood!
Seven T.}San Diego, CA}77}724}338}-1}4}9/26/2014}Yea imma fan....should be $7 though, not $10 for the 'sandwich'. 10's a bit much for what it is, but it is in fact NYC! Is it the best thing ever? No. Is it some good, quick eats on the go in the city? Absolutely! That salmon was on point! Ill hit em again, but its not gunna be one a those 'must-dos'...
Zuzzi E.}New York, NY}188}551}17}-1}4}9/21/2014}I always stop by here for a hearty (but not necessarily healthy) snack. My go-to is the salmon rice burger which is rich and full of flavor. The pickle dog is a great side and something to munch on while you wait (10-15 minutes) for your food.There's no seating and only one bench outside so prepare appropriately for the adventure!
Yvonne W.}Brooklyn, NY}2}21}18}-1}4}9/18/2014}got the ginger mugifugi (pork shoulder) - loved it, perfectly seasoned, def a cute quick bite.
T T.}Manhattan, NY}0}35}4}-1}2}9/15/2014}Rice burger is decent but pricey for what it is - it should not be more than $5!  This is a small take out window with only one bench to sit on and while the people are nice it is clear that don't really seem to have their system down.  It took the 4 people inside this tiny spot an inordinate amount of time to get your food out.  While it was alright it is no Mos burger and I won't be going back.
P C.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}1}9/13/2014}I was looking forward to the rice burger weeks before the grand opening, but I am hugely disappointed. I ordered a tsukune (chicken meatball patty) burger, which came out to be $8.44. While the chicken patty was tasty, it was definitely not worth it for the price. There was nothing special about the rice bun, not even crispy as I would have expected. In fact, it tasted more like an ordinary onigiri with chicken patty filling, which is something anyone can make at home easily. Don't waste your money on the rice burger. You're better off spending your money on okonomiyaki or takoyaki a few doors down the block!
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}3}9/10/2014}I was excited about this place, but they still have a lot to work on. Rice is barely grilled -- I'm used to the MOS burgers in Japan where the rice is so grilled it's crispy and gets stuck in your teeth a little. The lady recommended the salmon burger, which was $9. It was tasty, but the salmon was sooo small I practically finished it in two bites. Was definitely still hungry afterwards.I'd probably try a different one if I go back -- the sukiyaki burger looked a bit meatier and more filling.
Daniel L.}New York, NY}6}17}1}-1}3}9/6/2014}Had the pork burger and the chicken burger.... It tastes the same as eating rice and chicken on the side.  I was expecting something better than ramen burger.
Terri S.}New York, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}9/1/2014}The food was so good, I shutter at the idea of interrupting my meal to take photos of my food. (no, I did not misspell shudder. I was trying to open with a pun, hehehe). The smell and smiling faces of the young kids behind the counter transported me back to the tropic islands of Japan with the ring of a register drawer. What an amazing concept for Japanese Style Burgers as to place the protein and/or veg in between two fried sticky rice "buns". I also appreciate the fact that they have more than one veggie option to choose from and their daily, limited specials are extremely interesting. And what's a burger without the fries? I wouldn't know but it becomes something of the Devine when their potato wedges, too boot!!  The kombucha spiced fries were lovely and offered a sweetness to the tangy lotus root... Umami indeed!!The place is a walk-up window nestled in between The Cloisters and is a welcomed addition to the Japanese family of restaurants on this block so you know it's authentic. Especially since the cashier bestowed a barrage of thank yous in native tongue as I walked away with my bag-o-steamy goodness. It's a good thing there's no seating other than a bench on the sidewalk as this meal is best enjoyed after letting it cool as you embark on a journey to claim a serene spot in either Thompkins or Washington Sq Parks. Just a suggestion as it's too good not to sit and savor away from traffic.  Luckily this spot is nestled equally in between the two. After all, who wants to chase their burger with gawking, hungry eyes and a side of exhaust?
Paul N.}New York, NY}0}9}8}-1}2}9/1/2014}I was really excited to try this place, but left disappointed.  I got the Unagi (bbq eel, avocado, tempura flakes, shredded egg crepe) and the pickle dog.  The pickle dog was actually delicious, though $1.75 seemed a little steep for a pickle.  I love bbq eel, but the Unagi burger was lacking.  It tasted and smelled overly fishy, it looked unappetizing, and the rice buns/patties were very bland.  I might try Yonekichi one more time to give one of the other options a taste, but sadly I don't have high hopes.
CC Y.}Allegany, NY}6}2}1}-1}3}8/29/2014}Great, friendly service.  We got the signature Yone Burger with egg, which came out to about $8.50.I seemed to taste more of the rice than the meat and toppings which made the burger a little disappointing in general.They just opened, so they may still be tweaking the composition.
Stephanie P.}Astoria, Queens, NY}949}1030}25292}18}5}8/28/2014}I believe this fantastic hole-in-the-wall  spot been has open for a few weeks now and they're known for their "rice bun" burgers.Their "rice buns" are basically grilled disc like buns made out of white rice - NOT to be confused with a "rice cake", the rice is more like onigiri style then it is rice cake.Burger options include grilled salmon, veggie patty, chicken, beef and eel burgers which all come with a splash of soy sauce on the rice bun when you're ready to consume it.They're pure awesomeness and I have to return again soon when my phone's battery is able to take more photos, yumm! :D
Christine T.}San Francisco, CA}846}803}1042}-1}3}8/27/2014}New hole in the wall rice burger spot. I had the salmon burger which was good, what I really enjoyed was the wasabi salt fries. This place is cash only, no seats so be prepared to eat your food standing or go find a seat somewhere close by. Not sure if I'm into this rice burger fad.
L D.}New York, NY}0}42}0}-1}2}8/21/2014}Okay so I heard about this place serving what was billed as a rice burger opening up in the east village and wanted to try it.   Luckily there was only one person ahead of me when I got there and I was able to order fairly immediately.  I got the Kinpira which cost 6.50 (7.08 with tax).  The wait for it was not long and it came in a reasonably sized cardboard box.  When I looked inside I was immediately disappointed.  It wasn't so much of a burger as a slider I'd say.  The thing couldn't have been more than about 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches or suffice to say it wasn't the size of a regular burger (so why the moniker rice burgers I don't know) and it definitely wasn't a size worth 6.50.  It wasn't too bad taste-wise but not near enough of a delicacy to pay that kind of money for it particularly when there are so many other places in the east village that give you much better value for your money.
Mike C.}Forest Hills, NY}5000}1535}58887}18}3}8/20/2014}I think the hype over these Rice Burgers lasted about one night.I bought into it and was all ready to go ASAP, which was two days after their soft opening. Earlier in the day, I read a very unflattering post from the Daily News, which mentioned 20-30 minute waits for these new rice burgers.I had no idea what to expect, but I was happy to see no line at all when I showed up at around 6 PM. It's a small walk-up window with a bench out front to sit on while you wait (too long) for your little rice burgers.I am sad to say I agree with most of the early negative reviews. There were a lot of things wrong with this meal and not many good things to say.We tried the Tsukune Rice Burger ($7.75) with a soft-boiled egg (+ $1.25), which is a chicken meatball patty with special sauce and shishito peppers. The misshapen rice patties were pretty tiny on this one, with a lot of the patty hanging over the sides. The top bun was closer to an oval, and very mismatched with the bottom one, which made for a very messy time. The peppers also completely fell out once I picked it up. As for the egg, I wouldn't bother adding it - it was a fully cooked yolk, which was chalky and didn't add much to the flavor of the burger. The patty had a pretty good taste, but the patty itself was quite bland.We also tried the Unagi Burger ($9), which was made with eel, avocado, tempura flakes and shredded eggs. This was akin to shoving an overly ricey Dragon Roll in your face and trying to eat it all before it fell apart. The few tiny strips of eel were a little depressing, and were overpowered by the massive chunks of avocado.Lastly, we of course got the side of Furi Furi Fries, with the Wasabi Salt Seasoning. You can get a small for $3 or a regular for $6, or just add them along with a drink for $4. They came in a comically small portion in a comically huge bag that you practically needed to stick your arm into up to your elbow to retrieve some. Even worse, they were the lowest form of fries possible, the potato wedges. They were soft and soggy, and were slightly saved by having an interesting and different taste from the wasabi seasoning.What a shame. We definitely do not have the next Ramen Burger on our hands with this flash in the pan trend that doesn't seem like it will make it. Hopefully they will improve over time once they are done with the soft opening mode, and maybe add more menu items and improve on the existing ones. I was wavering on 2 stars, but the staff was so nice and friendly, and a few bites of the messy burgers were pretty tasty. Perhaps I'll return in a few months to see if things have improved if they are still around.
Crisanto D.}Jamaica, NY}13}74}0}-1}1}8/20/2014}Seriously dude?  I am not impressed with this dish.  Two rice in a form of a patty,  with a piece of meat and a not so spicy chili, and a hard boiled poached egg.  If I want something like this, I could have made this myself at home.  This invention is so uninspiring.
Anna K.}New York, NY}607}174}865}18}4}8/19/2014}Actually passed by on my way to a meeting and noticed the buzz. There so many burger creations these days. This one is rice burgers, like ramen patties instead of bread, but rice and noddles.......The fries are "ricey" and they're fried in rice-bran oil with wasabi saltWorth a try, definitely an adventure for foodies.
Martin W.}Brooklyn, NY}173}591}431}18}5}8/18/2014}Awesome new Japanese spot on 9th street. Ordered the Pork-Shuga & Furi-Furi which is small fries.The rice burger was quite delish and very hot with yummy pork. The french fries are nice wedges hot and seasoned perfectly. Order the Furi-Furi with Ume Konbu for real!The counter girls are real cute, I love that Japanese accent. Oh man such good Japanese fast food.

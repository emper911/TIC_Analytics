Zev L.}New York, NY}165}94}36}18}4}5/6/2018}Soba-Ya was a very delicious experience. I have lived above it as long as I can remember, but this was my first time eating here. I got a combo that came with a chicken don bowl, and a bowl of soba. For my first soba bowl i thought this was great! Very flavorful but not overwhelming broth. The Don was also delicious, as the egg made the rice so creamy. The portion seemed small, but I left stuffed. Prices were a tiny bit high, but I still think well worth it.
Jenny L.}Boston, MA}3}51}19}-1}3}5/5/2018}Wouldn't come back. The soba is very so so , it is something you can buy at the supermarket. The best thing was the sweet potato side. The eel didn't have enough sauce. Very sad for the price that we paid for everything.
Ashley P.}New York, NY}97}88}42}18}3}5/4/2018}I wish I could say that Soba-ya is Soba-yasss, but it's pretty average as far as soba goes. Not amazing but not bad either. I had the Kamo Nanban (sauteed duck and green onion). The broth is light yet flavorful, but the duck was a little overcooked. The interior of the restaurant is decorated tastefully (nothing too heavy handed with the Japanese theme). The prices are a little expensive though. I probably won't be coming back any time soon.
Sammy T.}New York, NY}181}30}100}-1}4}4/26/2018}This place serves great hot and cold udon/soba noodles. We order a mushroom hot soba noodles and a cold uni soba, both tasted delicious even though the coldness of the noodles might be weird for some people. The staffs and the environment is very nice and has an authentic Japanese touch to it. However, the matcha creme brulee was not as tasty as we expected as the top sugar layer was too burned. Overall, it's a good lunch place and have a super cute entrance to take some Instagram-worthy photos.
Chloe C.}Springfield Township, NJ}240}19}27}-1}5}4/25/2018}I LOVE this restaurant, one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in NYC. The lunch box sets are a must try! Only 25 are made per day so make sure to get here early because they WILL run out fast. The lunch box set comes with your choice of hot or cold soba, tempura, rice w/egg and ikura, salad, perfectly grilled salmon, cucumber, radish & carrot, and a daily vegetable. Not to mention...a creamy strawberry dessert at the end! The staff is attentive and the food is wonderful. This restaurant is casual but nothing about it is short of high quality.
Teresa L.}New York, NY}46}235}1270}18}4}4/22/2018}Was walking around for a brunch place and came across this Soba place in East Village. Place is medium sized with many small tables and booths. Got seated right away around 1:30pm on a Sunday for a table of two.Since this is a Soba/Udon place, we figured we had to order the noodles. The lunch set was awesome which included soba, green salad, tempura, salmon, rice, and some veggies. The Kitsune udon was very good and soup was very flavorful. The highlight was the dessert. We had the ice cream assortments and we decided on black sesame, green tea and honey wasabi. Glad we tried the honey wasabi which was interesting and had a kick to it. If you are suffering seasonal allergies, it'll definitely clear your sinuses. The milk tofu was delicious!
Kathy X.}Queens, NY}660}329}3207}18}4}4/21/2018}​Upon entering, there is a rock garden with flowing water and a tree with little blossoms of pink, which was lovely. The interior was mostly wooden brown with orange-y lighting, making for a warm and inviting environment. ​I came here with a friend for an early dinner so that we could partake in the Early Bird Dinner Special, which consists of assorted appetizers, tempura, plain soba or udon, inari sushi and vanilla ice cream... All for $22! We were given 4 different mini appetizers to try (in order of my favorite to least favorite): Pickled vegetable with edamame and sesame seeds, sweet potato with black sesame seeds, pumpkin and water chestnut. I enjoyed all of these, except the water chestnut, which I have never been a fan of. The pickled vegetable had a tasty seasoning to it and the sweet potato was light and fresh. For our main course, we were served shrimp and vegetable tempura, rice wrapped in tofu pockets and had the choice between hot or cold soba, or udon, which was presented in a beautiful and clean manner. Since the restaurant's namesake is Soba and it is homemade, I chose the cold soba, which came with some sauce. The soba by itself was quite bland, but the sauce helped with making it more flavorful and I also dipped the tempura in the sauce. I really enjoyed the shrimp tempura, which was extremely crispy and yummy. The vegetable tempura was also good - Veggies tasted very fresh!  The sushi was great as well. The rice was perfectly cooked with the right, slightly sticky consistency and the outer shell was full of flavor. The dessert was vanilla ice cream with strawberry sauce on top. My strawberry was shaped like a heart and was super cute. The ice cream was just okay - I am not the biggest fan of vanilla flavor, but there were no substitutions allowed. I would have liked to try to black sesame ice cream though. The service was wonderful and everything came out seamlessly, one after the other. The menu is extensive so I would definitely consider coming back.
Jenny C.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}52}71}158}18}4}4/19/2018}I love the soup base that is served with the soba here. It's so warm and comforting and light at the same time. This quaint little place is snug but not tight enough to make me uncomfortable. I got the nabeyaki udon this time around and I was pleased with the flavors. The one down side is that the chicken had sunk to the bottom of the pot so I didn't even realize it was there until I was alarmist done with my meal. The egg on top was so luscious and rich- packed with the flavors of the broth. I've been here multiple times but this place never disappoints me. I do ave to say that it is slightly pricier that the average soba/ ramen places in NYCHA but it's well worth the money.
Shikai L.}Chicago, IL}193}173}18}-1}1}4/18/2018}The WORST noodle I have ever had in a restaurant during my 25 years of life. For the noodle, the soup, the chicken, I cannot image anything worse. I prefer instant noodles than this one, even if overpriced as 18 dollars w/o taxes/tips.
Brandon Z.}ASTORIA, NY}0}8}1}-1}1}4/11/2018}Found a piece of metal in my overpriced udon. There's definitely better places around and definitely better value can be found in the neighborhood.
JP C.}New Haven, CT}0}2}1}-1}5}4/2/2018}Decent Japanese food place with fantastic services. Came at 12:15pm on Sunday and there was no line. Ordered the mini lunch set and it was very fulfilling that you can get both soba (or Udon) noodles and a rice bowl. Though it was "mini", the portion was still quite large for girls. Would definitely come again
Yejin P.}Boston, MA}122}5}3}-1}3}4/1/2018}good vibe. great for small gatherings! my friends tried plain zaru soba and it was really good!I ordered uni soba and tbh it was a disappointment... They put two types of uni in my bowl, and although I doubt that they served uni that is not fresh, one of them really really didn't taste right and I got stomachache after the meal. maybe it was a coincidence, however I would recommend fellow uni lovers to order something else on the menu because it wasn't a great experience! Totally would go back for other menus tho.
Freefinder N.}Manhattan, NY}2}25}3}-1}5}3/27/2018}my favorite soba restaurant in the city!!! everything tastes spectacular here! the food tastes just same w the food I had in Japan for 3 weeks- amazing chef!!!!
E H.}Manhattan, NY}0}21}15}-1}5}3/27/2018}YES! The lunch sets of small soba (hot or cold) + small rice (your choice of tuna, salmon, eel, tempura, etc) for ~$20. We got the small tempura appetizer, eel combo, and salmon combo. Everything was so fresh - the salmon especially melted in my mouth. FYI, with the cold soba, at the end, they give you a small pot with hot water that is left from boiling the soba noodles (pasta water). You pour that into your cup of soba dipping sauce and sip it to end your meal. They don't take reservations, but we went on a Saturday at 12:30p and only waited 10 mins. I would definitely go back.
Viviann L.}Manhattan, NY}176}756}2481}-1}3}3/23/2018}Good food and decent price. A bit on the pricier side but it's alright. Good quality sashimi and nice service and decent speed. You can choose between small, regular, or larger portion but it's really not too much of a different and it's usually the noodles and rice that's different. Decent location and not too hard to find, and pretty convenient with a couple bus stops and the subway stations at walking distances. 5 mins do 6 and 8-10mins to L. Quite a lot of options and it's a decent restaurant. Quite busy and usually always a line. A few different seats but still very packed and crowded and loud.
Ivy H.}Seattle, WA}140}3}0}-1}3}3/22/2018}The food are good! But the checking experience was very  unpleasant! I gave 11% of the tips and the waiters returned back and told me they have a minimum 15% of tips. We only had 4 people which is not a large group. This is my first experience get requested by a waiter for a certain amount of tips. Tips should be decided by me based on your service. Decent food. Horrible experience.
Essie L.}Jersey City, NJ}14}68}9}-1}4}3/21/2018}I would say it's a good place for a date or a small gathering.Food is fine and price is okay. Came in at 7 on a Saturday night, no wait.
Howard M.}New York, NY}1}24}5}-1}3}3/18/2018}Sunday late lunch, came over to soba-ya, busy busy- but the wait times were minimal at 230pm.here's the splitWhat went well:-Japanese staff and authentic food items prepared to good standard- food prep as relatively quick and everything tasted legit, slighty overly salty.- they give you hot soba water to turn your soba dipping sauce into a hot soupy finish to your meal.- soba dipping condiments, the negi was sliced super thinly..just the way it should be.What didnt't go so well:- portion sizes were not a good ratio to what they charge on the lunch sets.  i expected 25% more soba for the mini donburi combos- the rice they used was medium grain.  i suspect they are using cali crop rice...need the short grain, high gloss, sticky but chewy Japanese grain...for what they were charging, about 20 bucks a set, you should be getting at least Cali crop short grain rice- everything was a touch salty, the tempura tare, the soba dipping, the unagi tare...id say they could reduce the sodium by 10% and hit the sweet spot.The soba is legit here, for a restaurant that specializes in soba, the taste, texture, and the way its served hits the right spots.  shame they couldn't own this meal by being better at the side dishes and little things...
Xue Er Cher L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}38}2}0}-1}5}3/13/2018}I love, love, love, LOVE this place! It's close to my campus and it's my favorite spot to get lunch even when there are so many more affordable places around. I always get the mini box lunch set because you get to try a little of everything, the rice with seafood, and their signature soba noodle.
Alex G.}Forest Hills, NY}0}42}0}-1}5}3/10/2018}Everything here is fantastic.  Take friends here, go with my wife on special occasions.  It's all good!  It gets crowded and there are no reservations, so avoid rush times.
Amy K.}Brooklyn, NY}80}26}13}-1}4}3/9/2018}I had a solid meal here. The seaweed salad is surprisingly very tasty and the dressing itself has a lot of great flavor. The trio of vegetables was fun to get to try a variety of different flavors, but the portions are relatively small and allow for just a few bites. The sweet potatoes were were my favorite.For my main I had the tempura soba. The broth was very flavorful and you could tell that the bodies were made in house. I got a large, which was a satisfying portion without being overly filling. I would have liked the option to add some spice to the dish. They offer a chili powder but it wasn't quite spicy enough.They don't take reservations and there is typically a long line, so arrival before 7 is key. There is also a special menu available for dinner before 7. I thought the meal overall was pretty good but I wouldn't be willing to wait on a long line for it.
Mykel B.}New York, NY}343}454}39}-1}4}3/4/2018}$50 a person for soba? Ouch! We did have a few beers and some deserts... everything was very good... still the bill was a surprise. I had the mushroom soba: just wonderful! Also had the "Japanese infused Belgian Beer." (You get a choice of Rouge or Blanc.) I've never seen it anywhere else and it too was delicious. They don't take reservations, so expect to wait a bit. It's worth it... if you have enough space on your credit card.
Danielle M.}New York, NY}365}486}41}18}4}2/21/2018}The BF & I arrived for an early dinner this past Saturday night - there was a 20 minute wait around 7PM.  As we waited, we watched videos of how they make their Soba noodles in-house and I salivated watching everyone else in the restaurant eat.  We started with an order of their Shrimp Shumai which was so so good.  We then shared the Stamina (fried chicken Soba) and the Nebayaki Udon.  We were expecting a side of cold Soba noodles with dipping sauce but the Stamina was more like a noodle soup... still very yummy!  The Udon was pretty good but I think the main event here is the Soba.  For dessert we had the green tea creme brulee.  If we were to do it all over again we would get the Shumai, their colossal side of shrimp tempura, and different Soba noodle dishes.  It is pricey but we enjoyed our meal and would come back!
Dan S.}Fair Lawn, NJ}84}3}0}-1}4}2/15/2018}Delicious and authentic soba dishes. The food and decor are true to its origins. One star removed for the very high prices.
Ruby C.}North Conway, NH}2}130}59}-1}5}2/14/2018}Yum yum!I tried their shrimp tempura hot soba noodles, which was delicious! It came with 3 pieces of shrimp tempura. The soba noodles were cooked just right. The broth was delicious (in my opinion)- it's very clear, and slightly tangy, broth. I also got some broccoli and eggplant tempura, and loved the dipping sauce!We came here on a weekday for dinner, and while it was quite busy, there was no wait! I'm not a huge fan of their desserts. There were 4 of us sharing 4 different desserts, and none of them were that good. In general, nothing was sweet enough, which probably some ppl would prefer! But I get dessert for the sugar. I got the green tea creme brulee, and the green tea part just wasn't very good. Overall, I highly recommend the place and can't wait to go back!
Chu J.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}24}1}2}-1}4}2/9/2018}If you are looking for a good undo or noddles, this is one is nice option for you. They have the lunch special that has small undo with other many options like with Grilled chicken, eggs over rice. This is a good place should check it out.
Kristyn K.}Manhattan, NY}27}79}20}-1}4}2/6/2018}My husband loves this place and tries to convince me every weekend to go for a lunch set. I'd give it 3 stars, he's give it 5. There are some hurdles for me that I just can't get over, mainly the sides that come with the soba. In my experience, that's a personal issue and the sides here are great. There's just something about cold cooked vegetables and unknown fish that I struggle with. I still go once every couple months to learn, but the husband goes every time I'm out of town!
Viviann L.}Brooklyn, NY}152}2}0}-1}4}2/4/2018}Not a huge fan of dipping soba in the soup base. Mostly cuz I'm too lazy, but this place was pretty good.
Julius Y.}New York, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}2/2/2018}Really enjoyed my cold tuna soba. Tempuras are flaky and crunchy. Nice decor and friendly environment. Can't wait to try their dons and udon
Lindsey E.}Manhattan, NY}20}77}35}18}5}2/1/2018}If you wanna switch it up from your usual ramen or pho, this place is a good in between. They have an extensive udon and soba menu where you can get fish roe, Uni, sick and an assortment of other options! We started with the chicken karage and the pork belly in broth, both were top notch. My friend had the udon with duck, which was phenomenal (I kinda started wishing I got this instead) and I had the raw tuna with soba. This place makes it's one soba so I def wanted to try that, but the broth is so tasty that it would've been perfect for a good day. This place is a bit pricey but def worth it for the food you get.
Dana S.}Houston, TX}0}9}11}-1}5}1/27/2018}Pretty good soba! Visited here on a Saturday night and had a decent 20 minute wait. The soba was tasty and a good texture. They have options for hot/cold soba as well. Top that off with a green tea brûlée for dessert and it's a perfect meal.
Skye P.}Washington, DC}1053}86}768}18}4}1/24/2018}authentic japanese soba spot, sunday lunch date (around 3PM) for three. + check for the hours as they have a closing break between lunch and dinner! (lunch ends at 3PM) + we walked in and only had to wait about 15 minutes + they have an extensive menu list for both cold and hot soba noodles and bento lunch boxes + each noodle dish comes in a REGULAR and LARGE size. personally, i thought the regular was just fine in terms of portions. what we order: + COLD uni soba noodles -- possibly the most popular menu item and if you're a fan of uni, you don't even need to hesitate ordering this, since it comes with an abundance of uni (i've never seen so much served at once). my friend thought she was sacrificing hot soup for cold noodles, but at the very end of the meal, they actually pour hot broth into cold soba bowls as a finishing touch. + HOT chirashi soba noodles -- i chose the semi-fish/vegetarian hot bowl mainly because it came with an array of ingredients. it had mushrooms, fried veggies, the naruto fish cake, etc. it was a lot of food even as the regular sized. + LUNCHBOX with unagi over rice and regular hot soba noodles -- my friend wanted best of both worlds and she thoroughly enjoyed having both rice and noodle soup. we were too full by this point, but next time we'd really like to try the green tea creme brulee. the bathrooms also have cleaning toilets where they shoot water up your :)
Stephanie D.}New York, NY}726}276}44}18}3}1/24/2018}The soba is REALLY GOOD. But is it worth $30?? Nah. My bill was $42 with a large soba and one plum wine. Would have rather gone to NYC restaurant week for dinner than come here for that cost.
Jessica K.}New York, NY}333}1054}586}18}3}1/22/2018}really good spot for soba noodles. all the noodles are pretty good so I can't say I have a favorite however I do like to start with the  tempura and tatsuta age.
Danielle O.}Bowie, MD}397}23}44}-1}5}1/22/2018}While my boyfriend and I were visiting East Village, I was set on eating soba noodles. My boyfriend is Japanese, so he has pretty high standards for what he considers to be "good Japanese food," but we were both pretty pleased with the food. It ended up being one of my favorite places that we ate at during our weekend visit.Atmosphere:The restaurant looks unassuming from the outside, but it's very modern and nice on the inside. Simple and sophisticated. There were plenty of tables filled, so I'm glad that we were able to drop by and get seated right away.Service:The service here was pretty excellent. They were very attentive, fast, and friendly. It was a stress-free dining experience.Food:We decided to share one of their lunch sets with the pork katsu don and cold soba noodles. Lotus root and marinated pumpkin were also served on the side. $19 was a little expensive for the amount of food that you get, but it would still be decently filling for one person.My boyfriend really enjoyed the pork kastu don (even more than the soba noodles). It was meaty and packed with flavor all soaked up into the egg and rice. The shredded nori on the top was also crispy and a nice touch.Because the noodles are housemade, they were unique to other places. They were somehow firm but also still chewy at the same time. It was good mix. The tsuyu (dipping sauce for soba noodles) was savory and complimented the noodles well, especially with the green onions added into it. They also provide you with wasabi if you're into that, but I'm personally not a fan. Overall, Soba-ya definitely satisfied my soba noodle craving, and I would visit again for a more proper dinner.
Usti H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}10}94}100}18}3}1/22/2018}I love the concept- hand made soba noodles in a cute and modern Japanese resto. But tbh, who would pay $20-25+ for a bowl of soba? Not me lol- wayyyy too overpriced for what you get. The noodles didn't seem hand made to me, and the portions were SO small. I had karage along with my soba and I was still hungry by the end of it :(
Louise H.}Boston, MA}174}15}5}-1}5}1/20/2018}The atmosphere and decor in Soba-ya is very nice and inviting. In the waiting area there's an iPad that plays a loop of videos on the restaurant and on how to properly eat the noodles. We waited on a Sunday night around fifteen minutes for a table. When you give your name they ask for your number so you can leave the restaurant while waiting if it'll be a long wait. I ordered a basic soba with spinach and a fish cake and added salmon roe and crab meat. For a drink I ordered the peach fizz, which was very good and refreshing!The broth of the soba was amazing and had lots of flavor. After adding the salmon roe and crab meat it was perfect! The waitstaff is very kind and friendly and helped me with the menu when I got a bit confused. For dessert we had the green tea creme brûlée which was also very good! I wish it had been a bit bigger, but for the price it was reasonably sized. I would definitely come back and recommend Soba-Ya to friends.
Daniel D.}Manhattan, New York, NY}778}185}167}18}5}1/15/2018}The lunch soba set is a really good deal. The soba set includes a bento box of small items and some rice followed with a soba noodle. Be prepared for a long wait, but the food is oh so excellent and well worth the time.
Shirley G.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}345}269}493}18}3}1/15/2018}I am pretty disappointed with this place mainly because it is unreasonably overpriced. I got the uni cold soba with grated yam. Service was great and inside was very cozy. I had a party of 4 and it took only 30 min to be seated during the prime hours of dinner time. The uni soba was good, but not amazing. I liked the texture of the soba. I wasn't a big fan of the yam though. I've had uni cold soba before and it was often flavorful and buttery (sometimes it becomes overwhelming). The uni here was unusually bland. I ended up settling with a small which was a hefty $26.25..... the sizes offered depends on how much noodles you want. They don't give much. I was slightly hungry when I entered and left slightly satisfied. The rest of my party were not that pleased with what they had, mainly because of the pricing. There are PLENTY of soba places in Manhattan that would give the same stuff without breaking the bank. Don't get me wrong. Food wasn't bad, but it didn't justify the prices at all. Otherwise, I found it very cool how all the soba noodles are hand made at the restaurant. While you're waiting, there's a tablet that displays how they make it. It's pretty amazing!
Zoe P.}New York, NY}8}20}39}-1}4}1/10/2018}Soba-ya is a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner in the East Village. We came on the snowy Saturday of Santa-con to try and avoid the crowds and dodge some drunk people. The dining room is so calm and serene, it was a perfect place for such a lunch. I got the cold soba and tuna combo lunch set, which was great but instantly regretted not getting hot soba on such a cold day. We had lots of refills of green tea and were thoroughly warmed up by the end of lunch. I will definitely keep Soba-ya in mind when I'm in the area if I want a warm, casual spot for noodles and soup.
Rapas C.}New York, NY}212}70}194}18}4}1/7/2018}The definition of comfort food in all possible ways.I love coming here for their lunch set, which my go-to is the mini pork katsudon and cold soba. Great value and you get with the noodle and the meat, the hot and the cold.I have also had their tempura and it was nice, not as crispy as I the way I love my tempura. It was not greasy and was enjoyable. I tried my friend's curry udon and it was really good, I just think it would probably be way too heavy for me if I had to finish the whole bowl myself. Another dish I tried was the soba with uni, it's my friend's personal favorite but I think it was not quite worth the price, I don't know if I went on an off day but their uni didn't taste that good, which is the whole point of the dish.The service is great and I like the warmth interior of it.
Jarod Y.}Manhattan, NY}2}15}38}-1}5}1/6/2018}Sobaya is a Japanese  #soba place in #EastVillage. I'm not such of a soba person so I can't judge. I think it was good. However, I want to rave about their desserts & excellent service.I was really hungry that day so the #LunchBoxSet  fully satiated me & more! It was massive & included a variety of the best items available at the restaurant. You'll get #ShrimpTempura  & a bowl of hot/cold soba/udon with the #chirashi #salad  #SeasonalVegetables & #BroiledSalmon  On Wednesdays, they have 50% off #desserts. Don't think, just go! The desserts are worth braving the subzero blizzard  bomb  happening outside. We had #MilkPudding with strawberry, #Manju with #RedBean filling + #MatchaIceCream, & the star  of the show, the #Anmitsu (#agar + #RedBeanPaste + #BlackSesameIceCream + #strawberry + #GlutinousBalls).
Yuki U.}New York, NY}0}43}0}-1}5}12/28/2017}Wow!! I felt like I was in Japan!! The foods, the service and the atmosphere were amazing. Everything which I tried was excellent!! I highly recommend people who really miss Japan or are interested in Japanese culture.
Gab G.}New York, NY}185}1326}3675}18}4}12/27/2017}Had an excellent dinner on a weeknight here. Walked in without a res at 6:30ish and waited about 10 mins. My boyfriend and I shared a trio of vegetables to start (the Japanese pumpkin was my favorite), followed by tempura and duck soba. We weren't overly full, which is nice, but next time I'd probably get a second entree!
Wolfman A.}Manhattan, NY}40}11}2}-1}2}12/25/2017}Returning after several years, I found Soba-ya to have "engineered" the menu and the portions to "encourage" purchasing additional dishes.One comes here for ....soba noodles, which are sadly in short supply in the soup.   As another reviewer commented, the quality / recipe is extremely average and can be easily duplicated after a short trip to an Asian supermarket.We ordered a large Sashimi appetizer which was a bit overpriced for what it was and had inedible crayfish - unclear if it was intended as decoration or to be eaten.Soba-ya remains extremely popular due to its location and very good service but I'd probably not return as I feel there are better nearby options
Emily C.}Queens, NY}556}45}223}18}5}12/24/2017}Came here to try some Soba since I was recommended by a couple of friends to come here. First off, the exterior of the restaurant was really cute and Japanese-y. When I walked inside the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were both greeted with a warm welcome in Japanese, immediately, I thought the atmosphere was super friendly. The waitress that served us was really patient and since it was our first time, she helped us out and recommended us the popular choices among the many options on the menu. I ordered the Kinoko hot soba noodles and my boyfriend ordered the Tuna Avocado Don. We also ordered the tofu & seasoned peppers from their seasonal appetizers menu. The soba was warm and super satisfying for the cold weather and his Tuna Avocado Don was fresh and delicious as well. Staffs were really friendly and the menu was self explanatory. I definitely want to come back and try their lunch sets for next time!
Kathy G.}Laguna Niguel, CA}237}157}592}-1}4}12/22/2017}Not bad! I was satisfied with my lunch, but the soba was too salty for some of us, so this can be improved a little bit,m. The dessert we had was not bad, I liked the jelly with fruits as a light dessert after the meal.
Monica L.}Manhattan, NY}26}149}226}18}5}12/19/2017Updatedreview}Lunch box is amazing!!!!!!Variety and quality food! Everything so so yummy!!! Best deal ever for lunch!
Annabelle L.}New York, NY}67}76}208}-1}3}12/18/2017}To be honest, rating for this restaurant is very hard because their cold and hot soba quality vary a lot.I LOVE the cold Uni soba w grated mountain yum. It's so smooth and rich with their homemade soba noodles. However, their hot soba and appetizers are really mediocre. I'd definitely go to ISE to have hot soba since the overall quality is much better at ISE.
Rebecca M.}Philadelphia, PA}0}18}0}-1}5}12/11/2017}This place consistently delivers tasty soba noodle soup and service without compromising on price.
Julianne G.}Manhattan, NY}31}225}456}18}4}12/11/2017}A group of 8 of us came here for dinner last night at about 7:30pm. We called first to see if we could get a reservation but they said we should just come over and should be fine. When we got there they told us 10min wait. After about 15min they said 5 more min. About half an hour of waiting and they were able to seat us. So, take their wait times with a grain of salt.// ServiceService was good and pretty quick. The only thing they got wrong was my nabeyaki. The waitress told me she wrote down "regular tempura" for my order. But when I reminded her I asked for the egg on the side and the tempura soba doesn't come with the egg, she realized she just wrote the wrong thing down and stopped trying to convince me I ordered tempura.// FoodThe food was delicious! The soba noodles were perfect and the soup was rich and flavorful. The soup for both the soba and udon were the same but the udon was slightly richer due to the mushrooms, fish cake, etc in the soup. Also the udon came extremely hot - it was still boiling when they put it down in front of me so be careful!
Holland C.}Brooklyn, NY}142}32}0}-1}5}12/11/2017}This place has quickly become one of my favorite noodle joints in NYC.I've been to Tokyo a few times, and this is pretty much the closest and authentic Japanese noodle shop I've encountered in NYC. With the exception of the size (it's pretty big for a noodle shop in Tokyo) the food is spot on.The service is great. The place is clean. The noodles are fantastic and they have many different combinations from udon, to soba, both hot and cold options. In addition to that, the lunch specials can come with either seared tuna, or tempura, all that stuff. It's fantastic!If there was one drawback is it's not that cheap, but considering that it's one of the best (in my opinion) it's worth spending a few extra bucks for good noodles.Go here!!
DandM S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}22}2}-1}5}12/6/2017}Soba-ya makes very authentic Japanese food. (I'm Japanese.) If I could afford it and if I lived closer to East Village, my husband and I would frequent this restaurant. The flavors, particularly of the broths (dashi), are rich and Kanto-esque (on the sweeter side), unlike the more refined Kansai flavors that I'm accustomed to (being from Kansai myself).In any case... YUM! For sure one of the best most authentic Japanese restaurants in the US.
Fifi C.}Charlotte, NC}10}97}156}18}5}12/4/2017}I ordered the rice with slice tuna and cold soba bento lunch. The rice bowl with tuna is very tasty and the soba is great quality and is cooked perfectly
Michelle L.}New York, NY}0}13}8}-1}4}11/30/2017}Been here 3 times and ordered the same items every time: shrimp tempura cold udon noodles. Was not disappointed so I can comfortably say that it is consistent in quality. The udon is thinner than other restaurants in NYC but it's still chewy. Friendly service.
Fiona B.}State College, PA}1}20}15}-1}5}11/29/2017}Although it is a soba place, their salmon tartare don with avocado and chilli flakes is so good I come here at least once a month. Other notable menu items include the uni mountain yam appetizer, duck warm soba and tempura cold soba. I've brought friends from out of town to this place on numerous occasions and everybody loves it :) Post meal, cross the street for some awesome takoyaki too. (Cash only)
Yvonne T.}Baltimore, MD}255}34}4}-1}5}11/28/2017}We've been here many times, both for lunch and dinner. Food is consistently good and satisfying. The hot udons or sobas particularly hit the spot on cold days. The texture of the noodles are really on point here. We really enjoy the the lunch sets.... our favorites are the tempura and the unagi. Tofu appetizers are great. Also love their green tea creme brulee. Overall quality of food and ambiance of this place is on par with similar no-frill restaurants in Japan.
Kathy S.}Austin, TX}0}4}0}-1}5}11/26/2017}Delicious Japanese food, the people and environment are like Japan ! Most definitely recommended for everyone ! Go and enjoy like you are in japan !
YiHsin C.}Flushing, NY}67}8}2}-1}4}11/26/2017}Waiters were very nice and courtesy. The atmosphere was very friendly. I ordered Kake udon. The udon was so chewy! Very fresh and slippery. But the soup was tad bit salty. Portion size was perfect. Not too much and not too little. Though if you drink the soup then it might be too filing.
Angela B.}New York, NY}82}13}2}-1}4}11/26/2017}Pretty solid place for good, cheap noodles. Went on a Sunday night and waited 15 minutes for a table. I got the tanuki soba in the small size, and my boyfriend got the same in the medium size (which he had trouble finishing). Great service and great food.
Fiona W.}Pottstown, PA}0}6}0}-1}2}11/22/2017}Overrated. The service was kind of disappointing, the meal was ok and there's a line I don't even understand why.
Vickie Z.}San Francisco, CA}804}112}320}18}2}11/20/2017}Overpriced and disappointing. Not sure why this place is so popular. For $50 for two regular soba entrees, I was shocked how dissatisfied I was after. Presentation was deceivingly large. The soba noodles were spread across a large plate, but it was probably only the portion of a small bowl. Nothing memorable in taste so I won't comment there, but needless to say, we left hungry and dissatisfied.. and found ourselves eating some Japanese curry instead.
Michael L.}New York, NY}86}121}625}18}5}11/18/2017}Home-made soba and perhaps the best soba you can get in all of NY. I usually have the tempura soba and has never disappointed. The food is filling, service is friendly and fast. Pros: home-made soba, offers tempura soba and is authentic Japanese.Cons: there are no cons, but the price might be high for some.
Mindy S.}Long Island City, NY}4}42}8}-1}2}11/17/2017}I'm not sure why this place is so popular. I had tanuki hot soba and it was very salty and mediocre.
Kyle S.}Severna Park, MD}1}7}0}-1}5}11/15/2017}Wonderful authentic soba restaurant. The soba here is fantastic and they do a great job of making it feel like a real japanese soba shop. My favorite is the tenzaru - cold soba with shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura is the best tempura I've had in NYC, and it goes excellently with the refreshing soba. I haven't had many other items on the menu, but for good, authentic cold soba, this place is amazing.
Thy L.}Brooklyn, NY}67}284}340}18}3}11/13/2017}This place must have changed owners since 2009 or something. The first timeI came the menu was small and I had a tasty bowl of udon. Now menu is triple what it was and there's twenty some choices of soup for soba or udon and even more toppings. I got the mushroom broth with udon and duck to top it off. They forgot my duck and had to check if I ordered it so I got 3 pieces of thin sliced greasy duck. Hubby got the nabayaki which he thought was mediocre. Tempura ap was perfectly fried and served with individual sauces. The man making soba in the "soba tank" is cool to watch and the toilet seat is fully equipped Japanese. The heated seat was nice on a cold night!Many other places for Japanese noodles
Jolene H.}New York, NY}34}91}75}-1}3}11/13/2017}Highly raved.... used to. At leastThe home made sobas and tuna steak don (double the sauce) used to beckon us. Then it just became okay...It it always too crowded, with rushed services but most importantly the food quality has just slipped. Soba-ya is now just mediocre and for be price, there definitely are better places in the city (hi, ise lunch sets) Thanks for the memories, Soba-ya!
Christina T.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}11/3/2017}Love this place..  the only downside is the wait..  but - that just means they are doing something right!  Nothing bad to say.  Great food, friendly staff, cool vibe.
Haim G.}Brooklyn, NY}0}13}0}-1}1}11/3/2017}We are clients who had been coming there for years. Our baby was sleeping in the stroller and despite the fact that they could accommodate us without risking the traffic and service they refused.  We walked 2 blocks on 3rd Ave and we bump into Ise.  It is a great find. Way better soba and fish and much cleaner and friendlier, highly recommended.
Philip Y.}Princeton, NJ}0}10}0}-1}2}10/22/2017}Not sure why this place has such high rating. Been here a few times been consistently mediocre with bad service.Sobakoh used to be my choice but since they closed down I started to goto Soba-ya again and it just disappoints me every time. I'm done with this restaurant.
Lin C.}New York, NY}348}156}481}-1}2}10/21/2017}this USED to be my favorite soba spot... i have been bringing friends from out of town to soba-ya for years and also introducing this place to many local friends. i'm not one to write negative reviews, but last night my experience was so strange. i've been eating at soba-ya since 2014 or so and never had a bad experience...until last night. i went with a group of four other friends. we each ordered our own entree, a whole 720ml bottle of sake and a green tea brûlée. the bill came out to be nearly $200. on the check, there is a suggestion for gratuity starting at 18%. a friend put down $50 in cash and the rest of us split the check with our cards. we each tipped about 18% and left the restaurant. a few seconds after we left, the waitress came running after us to say that we didn't tip enough... and that we were supposed to tip exactly 18% each. first of all, tip is pretty much optional. and secondly, 15% is the standard tip amount. apparently, we were $2 off what they were expecting. actually, i had tipped a little more than 16% from my split total because i like my totals to be whole dollars. the 16% was only 17 cents off from the suggested total. she kept asking us to fix the amount, and we were flabbergasted. i told her that she had no right to ask us for more tip and that it was illegal. she seemed confused and didn't say anything, so we just went about our night. what a strange experience at one of my favorite restaurants in nyc. to say the least, i probably will search for a new favorite soba spot!
Chadsworth E.}New York, NY}1}36}0}-1}5}10/18/2017}A NYC GEMa beautiful atmosphere, top notch service and perfect soba handmade in the restaurant day in and day out Great for lunchGreat for dinner very fast, somewhat cheap and very consistent
Xinyi S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}194}3}13}-1}5}10/17/2017}I had the eel rice and some desserts. Very affordable, decent Japanese food. The location is low key hard to find, but what can I say, I'm willingly to travel the world for their matcha crème brûlée.
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}4}10/14/2017}Small place with good food. Been here many times and food has been great each time. Love their tofu pudding!
Peter H.}New York, NY}354}144}33}18}5}10/11/2017}The lunch special is truly special. To nab one of the 25 servings each day, aim to arrive within half an hour of opening. It is a lot of food, by the way. The soba itself -- obviously -- is delicious with its dipping sauce or light broth. The special features all the wonderful rarer Japanese flavors I now associate naively as "mountainous," like the yam and pickles and stuff. AND you get a hunk of fish and rice prettily dotted with black sesame.
Carmen W.}Brooklyn, NY}214}274}220}18}2}10/10/2017}soba-ya? more like soba-naa. soba is okay, but the price doesn't quite match the taste. I ordered the cold duck soba, and they were certainly more generous with pieces of duck than I had thought where I was able to spoon out 5 slices out my broth. However, the broth was too salty and I didn't like the notes of orange peel they had in it. my friend had the cold dipping soba which was extremely refreshing since it came with grated ginger and scallion, but when i come in for a meal i expect it to be something i can't do at home. the tempura that came with it looked lightly fried and healthy. overall, a healthy meal and worth 3 stars, but i took down 1 for the extremely SASSY host. the sassy host: upon entering, i gave him my phone number to be put on the wait list. when i came back, my best friend thought she saw him gesture us to come towards the table, but when we advanced he snappily told us that he will call us when the table was ready as it was still not yet there. when we were eating and sitting, my legs were crossed and my leg stuck out of the table and upon his passing he pointed to my foot and said excuse me. i'm okay with sassy, but when it's not entertaining and borderline rude, maybe you shouldn't put them up front where customer service matters the most.P.S. go to cocoron instead
Major L.}Washington, DC}14}30}100}18}5}10/7/2017}The foods here are just delicious. The decor in the restaurant is really warm and with the authentic Japanese style interior design. It's not a huge restaurant, so I won't recommend to have a big group of people to come here at the same time. I ordered a  lunch special, which was a combo of rice bowl and soba. Worth every penny deal. I got the eel rice bowl and hot udon. The eel rice bowl was perfect, I love it. Eel was very well sauced, which wasn't salty or greasy at all, and the rice was very soft, which goes with eel perfectly. About the udon, the texture of the noodle was very chewy and the soup was very light, so you can clean your taste buds after the meal. The combo also comes with little vege dishes, which give you a taste of spicy, sweet, and salty. Good combo. Overall, this is a good restaurant with good atmosphere and foods!
Linan C.}Manhattan, NY}1}94}67}-1}5}10/6/2017}Authentic setting and food. They give you a pot of broth at the end of the meal so you could turn soba dressing into soup, like how it's traditionally done in Japan. I had cold soba with some veggies which was great. Although the food was great, I find it extremely pricy - most of the soba dishes are over $20. Good for rich diners or once-in-while splurges for us poorer folks.
Jamie M.}Nutley, NJ}212}56}79}18}5}10/1/2017Updatedreview}Ever since my review on 4/14 the service has been impeccable. Their staff has gotten a grip on how to organize their reservations properly. The food quality has been consistent, so I have no updates in that department! Re-reading my review I saw how negative my tone sounded, and I have to emphasize that that particularly day the service was horrible. But I genuinely love my experience here, and it is my favorite restaurant in NYC. Please come to Soba-ya, I can assure you will not regret it!
Mel Z.}Fullerton, CA}72}198}0}18}5}10/1/2017}All I have to say is.. their homemade udon and soba are delicious! Fresh noodles really elevate each dish. It's a small restaurant and can get busy during dinner, but we went towards the latter half of dinner service on a weekday and we were able to get seated right away. Next time I visit NYC, I'll be sure to go back and try more dishes!
Lisa T.}South El Monte, CA}5}24}12}-1}5}9/26/2017}A bit pricy, but worth it for the delicious soba. I got the sake oyakodon lunch set and the salmon over rice was so good. Got there right at noon on a Monday and the place filled up quickly.
Jenn E.}Seattle, WA}241}327}114}18}4}9/25/2017}Adorable soba spot with super efficient service and great food.  Came here on a Sunday night and it was crowded but not packed and we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving.We opted for a delightful cloudy sake - the Jozen Aged Junmai Ginjo (in a red bottle) that was being promoted on our table. It was light, sweet and not very strong tasting and super easy to drink.  The bottle easily had 6 servings in it as well so for the price it was a stealAfter much deliberation I got the special vegetarian cold soba which had ginger, spices, Japanese radish, carrots, and shallots. It was served with fresh wasabi (big win) and scallions on the side.  The dipping sauce was perfectly flavored and not too salty and complimented the buckwheat well.  We also had the cold tofu appetizer which I thought was good but on the smaller side. The only downside of our night was that T got the okra and mushroom cold soba special which I thought was ok but not my favorite.  The texture was WAY too slimy for my liking.Otherwise, great, and I'll definitely be back!!
Kat B.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}7}-1}5}9/24/2017}This restaurant is a lovely and authentic place to get Japanese noodles. We arrived around 8pm and waited only 15 minutes. My boyfriend and I tried the hot chirashi (soba) and teriyaki (udon). Both dishes were delicious. We also shared uni tororo, which was incredibly fresh and tasty. For dessert, we had the green tea brulee, which was light and not too sweet. We're definitely coming back to sample the rest of the menu. The service is good and the place is not too loud, so it's great for dates or dinner with friends.
Joy M.}Chicago, IL}1}49}121}-1}5}9/21/2017}Super authentic soba and udon noodles. We were able to get able with no wait, even scored the early bird dinner special. Tried the hot udon and soba and both were really great. Will definitely return and try the other things on menu...as we we eyeing every dish that arrived next table.
Loa H.}Oslo, Norway}0}4}0}-1}1}9/16/2017}Unfortunately we never got to try their food, since we were "greeted" by quite rude staff. If good service and nice waiters is important to your dining experience, I would suggest you try another place.
Ben L.}Manhattan, NY}8}28}141}-1}2}9/11/2017}The curry udon was a huge broth with a flavorful curry and 4 pieces of chicken & lemongrass floating in it, literally.Disappointing even if affordable.
Peter M.}Fort Lee, NJ}241}366}809}18}4}9/10/2017}pretty busy for a saturday night. we were in the mood for some noodles since it was a cool evening. waited for about half an hour and got seated at the bar. our server at the bar was very pleasant. she gave us some hot towels to start which was a nice touch. nice selection of small plates/appetizers and they have cold and hot sobas which come in different sizes (small, regular and large). we tried the tomago (japanese omelette) which was tasty even without any soy sauce and I had a regular size seasonal hot aged tofu soba noodle. the broth was savory and the regular was filling enough. I enjoyed eating here.
Ching T.}Los Angeles, CA}0}4}0}-1}5}9/10/2017}The rice of unaju is very well-cooked. And the sauce is quite nice as well. Must try their cold soba.
Stephanie C.}Flushing, NY}47}61}43}18}5}9/3/2017}The most consistent authentic Japanese soba experience in all of NYC! Ceviche seasonal appetizer: great chunks of white fish paired with avocados, tomatoes, purple onions, cilantro, and radish. Great citrus soy sauce that coats the ceviche mix which gives this appetizer the tart and savory flavors that pair well with each other!Tuna don mini: portion is good enough for your small average eater who isn't in the mood for something with broth and heavy. Fresh cut tuna with a light soy marination, topped with seaweed and sesame seeds. Great overall traditional rice dish.Nebeyaki: udon noodle soup that comes with ALOT of toppings! Chicken, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green onions, seasonal greens, shrimp tempura, and carrot tempura. Ask for the tempuras on the side so they don't get soggy! Great dish for someone whose really hungry. Great soy broth that's flavorful yet light in bounce so you can go through the whole bowl and actually finish the soup! Stamina: Great intro to the soba world! Hot broth to dunk your noodles in! Now since you dunk your noodles into the broth; the broth is a bit salty. It's not a broth you sip and drink. It's simply made to coat your noodles and slurp up with. The fried garlic chicken is tender and delectable! If your new to the soba dipping experience I highly recommend this dish.Service is great, friendly, and extremely respectable. But don't get upset if you have to park your ass outside and wait for about 45 mins during high peak hours for dinner. It doesn't take away from their service nor their extreme consistency to pump out authentic food!
Vivian Y.}New York, NY}14}62}139}18}4}9/2/2017}This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York! I usually just get soba but upon my last visit I discovered two new appetizers - tuna and chicken. Already craving to go back.
Jane C.}New York, NY}1}25}75}-1}4}8/31/2017}Cute little place on the street. I got the lunch box not knowing they only make 25 of them everyday. The server said they usually run out of it by 1pm, but today was slow so they still had 10 or so at 1pm. The only bad thing was that I was seated at the bar and the servers kept running into my chair. But the milk pudding with the strawberry on top (included in the lunch box set) was pretty special. It wasn't too sweet or too heavy, just the lightly sweetened flavor of pure milk. I'd come back just for the milk pudding! It completely satiated my craving for sugar after lunch so now i won't go get another bubble tea and save 500 calories. If you are trying to eat not a lot, i wouldn't get the set, because it's just giant amount of food. I thought the box itself was it but it also came with a side of tempura and a giant soba (not pictured) and ended up having a ton of leftovers. Other reviewers say the ramen is good as well so i'd have to come back and try.P.S - they have the most amazing bathroom! Heated toilet seat and they have an ACTUAL INCENSE burning in the bathroom. It made me feel like I was in japan again. Kudos.
George Z.}Manhattan, NY}109}44}71}18}4}8/30/2017}My friend and I been talking about trying soba noodles for some time now and she found this place so we went to check it out! Always count me in with food!  We came on a Monday afternoon and it was still pretty packed but we managed to get a table right away! The inside of the place looked nice, very old fashion looking (in a good way)  Looking through the menu is a little overwhelming as I am not too familiar with traditional japanese food. We both knew we wanted to try soba but somehow both ended up ordering udon instead...Guess we both wimped out and got what we knew is good. Oh well, there's always next time! I ordered the Chicken Katsu Don and my friend got the Lunch Box Set. Chicken Katsu Don: Presentation was on point. Everything was brought out on a large tray. There was the Chicken Katsu on the left and the hot Udon soup on the right. It also came with some side dishes (lotus roots, seaweed, pickles, tempura bites, and extra scallions) Everything was overall pretty good, the udon broth was a little stronger than I would have liked but still enjoyable. Lunch Box Set: They only make 25 orders an day so just keep that in mind! My friend was very glad she was able to still order it at the time we got there. The Lunch Box Set is basically a big bento box with a bunch of items in it. Tempura, House Salad, Salmon, and of the Udon. There was 2 more items but can't seem to remember them. She enjoyed everything as there was nothing left at the end of the meal. By the end, we were both stuffed and couldn't move. The waitress brought out this little dessert after our meal. It seems like it was some kind of strawberry rice pudding? Not too sure so don't quote me on it but it was a nice end to all the food! Only thing I would mention is that prices are a little higher than I would have thought but we were satisfied so we didn't mind paying what we did.
Ingrid H.}New York, NY}56}67}45}-1}4}8/26/2017}Finally found a good soba place! Been craving cold soba noodles since coming back from Japan and this place is pretty good! Of course prices are what you expect from New York but the food quality was excellent.I got the lunch bento combo which included soba noodles, tempura, and a bunch of small dishes and rice. It came out to $21. I think they have a better lunch special/deal on the week days as well as a different menu for dinner (my friend who been there said so). They also gave us this free strawberry pudding dessert thing which was good. Service was attentive and decor was nice. We went around 1PM on a Saturday and there was no wait. However, by the time we left, the place was packed!
Joyce B.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}151}18}-1}3}8/26/2017}I have nothing to complain about the service but not a big fan for the food. I had the duck soba. It was bland. And the broth was like water and soy sauce oil combined together. I don't recommend at all. We were a party of three. My friends ordered two different hot soba which I don't remember. They didn't like theirs either. We also shared the seaweed salad that we actually all liked and some kind of fried salmon appetizer, which was okay.
Tiffany H.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}0}-1}4}8/22/2017}Wow. This place was amazing. The food was really authentic, as far as I know (I came with someone who lived in Japan for over a decade and is well-versed in Japanese cuisine). The seasonal noodles I had with tofu and yuzu were unexpectedly light. I don't think I'd ever had this combination of flavors before. The tempuru is also very well-made.
Risa H.}Brooklyn, NY}169}158}210}18}5}8/22/2017}I like finding homey Japanese restaurants because I grew up in a Japanese household.  Soba-ya is one of the best Japanese restaurants in the area - I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon for $23.50, and although the price is a bit high, the food is yummy.  The Nabeyaki Udon comes hot in a pot with chicken, egg, fish cake, mushroom and shrimp tempura.  I would want to come back to try the Ten Don (mini-$21.50, regular-$24.50, set-$27.50) sometime - I only wish the prices were lower!
Jessica L.}Brooklyn, NY}57}6}7}-1}2}8/21/2017}The extrior was pretty neat, the inside was somewhat a wide but close space. They give you towels to "wash" your hands, so you don't need to go to the restroom.The host was pretty awkward and not as friendly (? Lol)He would refill your water and the second time he did, he kind of slammed the glass on the table hard and I was abit frazzeled. The server was okay, he just didnt seem to get my question about the serving sizes which was weird, he kept saying it was only this much bigger as if I came here before... The people who worked there were walking around a lot in a  closed space, and it was prerry awkward...The duck soba was at least $21.75The soba had small cut pieces in the serving basket(?) Like leftover small ones. It was greasy and you couldnt bite it into two pieces, its a little bit of a big piece and the broth was alright... My friend got the regular soba and her broth was like soy sauce and water... Lol....The green tea cream brulee was unforunately the only good thing there
Qiyu J.}Manhattan, NY}18}16}27}-1}2}8/20/2017}This restaurant is crowd and I went there just as it opened at noon. The Kano nanban soba consists of 5 slices of toast duck which is not tender, and some onions. The left is just noodles. I believe it is over charged. The broth is almost water.Maybe this is an authentic soba restaurant, but I will not go there not time. Ramen is much more delicious than soba.
Peter J.}Manhattan, New York, NY}26}229}107}18}5}8/17/2017}Décor of the place was nice. I liked the entrance.Went there with friends and girlfriend. I was able to order in time to get their happy hour special. They had a small plate of vegetables.vegetable tempura and hot/cold soba noodles. I got the hot soba noodles. They were good. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. It was a fun time.I would go back if in the area.
Steve L.}Oakland, CA}0}27}0}-1}4}8/13/2017}This is THE place to go for soba and udon in New York. Everything I've tried here is good but their udon keeps me going back. Growing up in America I used to think udon was boring until I had the real thing in Japan. Soba-ya makes it just like they do in Nippon. The smoky dashi broth is super pure. In other Asian restaurants I usually don't consume much of the noodle broth because they tend to be greasy or contain MSG. But this broth is just made of high quality konbu plus bonito -- nothing more, nothing less, as it should be. The noodles are cooked just right and whatever condiments are included are finely made too. This is my idea of real comfort food.
Hannah V.}Flushing, NY}185}185}486}18}2}8/12/2017}I'm sorry but soba just isn't my thing. The broth is just plain bland. I had the duck hot soba and the broth was just weirdly sour soy sauce. Plus the duck slices were so so greasy. My bf had the chilled soba with fried baby sardines and that was even weirder. The sauce was exactly the same thing as mine except it was cold. And hello since when sardines became tangled up veggies thingy not fish?? Can somebody educate me on this cause I really can't understand soba. p/s: just found out they have matcha creme brulee, maybe I'll come back just for that.
Liz S.}New York, NY}636}530}1003}18}4}8/7/2017}Came around 7 pm on a Sunday night with a friend. The place was hopping, with crowds waiting in the entryway and on the sidewalk, though the room itself was peaceful. It's decorated in a typical Japanese style, with light wood and traditional scroll paintings, and a pond up front. It ended up only being about a ten minute wait despite being told half an hour. Lucky us!Although this restaurant may have soba in its name and at the heart of its menu, you would be remiss to skip the back page full of fish-on-rice bowls. I went for the salmon oyako don bowl ($22), and my friend had a veggie tempura one ($15.50). We also had some uni to start; unfortunately, they were out of the special uni with jellyfish, so we had to settle for uni with mountain yam ($12).The uni came out first about ten minutes later. Good quality uni, buttery and salty-sweet, but reminded me of how much I hate mountain yam. Any foam that turns to slime should not be trusted.Our bowls came out ten minutes after. Mine had gorgeous, large chunks of salmon and a reasonable helping of round, red roe. It wasn't the most amazing quality salmon I've had, but the rice was soft and the portion was generous. His was festooned with panko-crusted lotus root, carrots, and other goodies.Service is polite and the pace is appropriate; the volume level is also good for catching up with friends. However, many of the entrees are above $20, and I wouldn't say that anything we had was incredible. Overall, I would say that this is a good place to get a reliable Japanese meal, but it's a touch pricy for what you get.
Gaby B.}New York, NY}42}6}0}-1}5}8/7/2017}I love this place, the Kinoko Ramen is just perfect! really good appetizers as well, great service! Is nice to seat at the bar.
Yu Chuan C.}Pittsburgh, PA}179}2}7}-1}4}8/7/2017}This is my first time having soba in New York City.The dining environment is good; not so crowded.I ordered mini lunch set with salmon sashimi don and cold soba.If the white rice is cold with vinegar will be better.The salmon sashimi and salmon roe are really fresh.The dipping soy sauce for soba is not too salty.After finishing the meal, they will give you a pot of hot soup.Just mix the soy sauce for soba with the soup.The taste of the soup will blow your mind.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends.
Denay W.}New York, NY}275}205}616}18}4}8/4/2017}What a great spot for some authentic soba! Visited on a Friday evening and luckily didn't have to wait because we chose to sit at the bar. The restaurant itself has a very simple and traditional style Japanese decor with ample amounts of seating by NYC standards. Started off our meal with a regular sized sake, which is a good choice if you want to share with another person... or just want a lot of sake for yourself. As an appetizer we selected the Ika-Meshi and it was a different type of food choice for us, but so worth it! It's simmered squid stuffed with sticky rice. Because the restaurant is known for their soba, I went with their regular sized cold soba dish called Chirashi. The entree comes with a sauce to dump over it and I chose to add a little wasabi for some extra zing. Absolutely enjoyed the texture of their soba and the Japanese omelette that was in it.  Finished things off with the manju with green tea icecream. Very delightful and it definitely ended our visit on a high note.
Big B.}New York, NY}248}662}16}-1}2}8/4/2017}Tried their lunch set. Their soba is ok and the dipping sauce is great. However, their salmon mini oyaka don has too much ginger in it. In addition, there is no proper sauce or ratio of meat and rice of the don. The pricing is on the higher side.
乃馨}New York, NY}48}74}304}-1}5}8/2/2017}This is my favorite soba place. I have probably been here more than 10 times and I still enjoy it a lot. This is my first choice whenever I dine alone. I love the food and the atmosphere in the room - it mars me safe. I extremely recommend the cold soba, as it's just so appetizing all the time. Some people complain about the portion but here's a story: so once I went by myself and 2 gentlemen were sitting next to me. We all ordered the lunch set. We basically started at the same time, and one of the gentleman finished almost the same time as me. When he finished, his friend offered him his sides and said "I've never seen anybody finished the whole thing...if you are still hungry eat mine". Hearing that, I looked at my super clean bento box...and went speechless :/Anyways, a very good place for friends, as well as for a loner.
Nora T.}Staten Island, NY}405}35}23}-1}5}7/31/2017}I love this place! First time but definitely not the last. The waiters were all very friendly and the food was very authentic. I got the lunch box set with cold udon and chicken katsu which was amazing and very well worth the 21$ i paid. My only hesitation to give this 5 stars was that the chicken katsu was not what i expected in that instead of crispy panko covered chicken, it was cooked with egg so it was quite soggy over the rice. It was different, but still good!
Jody L.}Brooklyn, NY}181}34}10}-1}5}7/29/2017}Ordered the cold uni soba. It was pretty good and expensive lol $28 for the regular size. the place is nice and clean. The uni was fresh. The dessert is super cute & taste pretty good. I didn't feel fat at all eating the soba + dessert. (or maybe i'm just lying to myself) Anyways, it was a hot summer day and cold soba makes my stomach happy :)
Kara Y.}New York, NY}14}76}167}18}3}7/28/2017}I've got to say that I was quite disappointed with the food here! I ordered the duck soba, the soup tasted like it was just chicken stock mixed with soy sauce.. I am comparing my experience here to Cocoron as they both offer soba noodles, I feel Cocoron's soup/broth is so much better and their menu has more flavor options. My bf ordered the fried chicken garlic soba, and the broth tasted the same as mine, except that it was a little sweeter. It costs almost $20 for a bowl of noodles with protein, but the vegan options were cheaper. The shrimp tempura had way too much batter crumbs (almost double the size of the actual shrimp) and was just flavorless. The portion wasn't that huge, if we hadn't had a snack beforehand, I would've left here still hungry. The restaurant was beautiful and service was good, but I will not be returning.
Cree P.}Jamaica, NY}125}121}291}18}4}7/23/2017}I never had soba before, until I came here. I'm glad this was my first place to try it because it was delicious. Their lunch set is a pretty sweet deal for the price. For the sample price of $21 you get: A piece of fish, some salad, vegetables, other stuff I don't remember, annddd that soba (your choice of hot or cold! I got cold because it's hot out lol) also to top it off you get a cute little dessert after! Overall everything was pretty good and even though it's a lot you it's not heavy, so you don't feel like a cow after the meal. However, you can definitely share the lunch set with a friend, but I don't blame you for you don't want to... I didn't. Also I like the Decour of this place, it's very nice and traditional looking. It is a little small though, so sometimes it feels a little cramped. And because this place can get busy it can be a little challenging getting a hold of your waiter, or any waiter because everyone so fast to walk away  However because the food is so good it's not too upsetting. I would definitely come back!
Naoki S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}77}18}81}-1}3}7/18/2017}*3.3- Taste 3.0- Cost Performance 3.0- Service 4.0- Cleanness 3.5- Vibe 3.0A good casual soba place. (Japanese noodles) Not exceptionally good but cheap enough and good enough if you want to eat soba. The soba is actually great, but the food beyond that is not so good. Tempura, chawanmushi, yuba...etc is not up to my expectations. Service is great and soba is great, so I will recommend just eating soba there.
Carolyn Z.}San Jose, CA}62}15}2}-1}3}7/18/2017}A bit pricey for what's offered - at least for my dish, which was just plain soba noodles with like 4 cubes of tofu (came out to like $17). The warm towels they give you to wipe your hands with is a nice touch though. So is the free pudding/flan dessert.
Charlie P.}Folsom, CA}0}5}1}-1}5}7/16/2017}Amazing food! Fun Japanese atmosphere with very friendly, happy staff. Quick service and very clean!
Naill B.}Mineola, NY}60}90}7}18}5}7/12/2017}Tastes like actual Japanese Junwari Soba. Probably the only place in New York City where you can get the real stuff. My go to place for Soba when I need it. This is not cheap watery Japanese street Soba, which can be horrible. This is the real deal that would cost far more in Tokyo than at Sobaya. Take advantage of the Soba here. You don't need to go to Tokyo.
Sunny H.}New York, NY}0}12}12}-1}3}7/10/2017}I usually enjoy Soba-ya but there was way too much sauce in my Una Ju tonight. I mixed in a bowl of rice and it was still drenched in sauce, very salty (see pics). The service wasn't great either, the girl at the back was also impatient and dismissive when I told her about it, and tried to tell me that's how it's "supposed to be". I've been here quite a number of times, I know how it's supposed to be. Service here is almost always great, but today's experience and dining was a little disappointing.
Zainab K.}Queens Village, NY}93}5}1}-1}5}7/8/2017}Had my first soba experience here! I sat at the bar and we ordered plain cold soba noodles and since I had an odd craving for tomogo we got that as well. We ordered green tea creme brulee for desert on whim. The tomogo was perfect; fluffy, slightly sweet, almost melts in your mouth. The text of the soba was perfect. Although it's my first time, I know the noodles were well made. They're chewy (but not over cooked) and soft. The dipping sauce was a good balance. The wasabi they use is the most mild. I was able to eat is plain without the burnI liked the green tea creme brulee. The pudding texture was amazing and the sweetness was the perfect level.I came here Saturday night, but I urge anyone to come here during their lunch and dinner special. Dinner is from 5:30-7:30 (Mon-thurs). We spent about $20/ person for the 3 dishes and an order of pickled plum. This easily couldve been half if we came during the dinner.  Me and my cousin split an order of regular soba, so I'm sure the sets can fill two people.
Stella D.}Seattle, WA}367}262}496}18}5}7/8/2017}Best soba place I have ever been in. I got the mountain yum soba. It is definitely not cheap but it is so tasty and refreshing. I am not usually a big soba fan because the noodles always taste either too bland or too stiff. Theirs is just salty and soft enough. The service is excellent. The girl at the counter always provides the service at the time needed most with a big smile. This place is not cheap though. Come 5:30-7 for their early bird special will be ideal. U can also come with a friend and order a big soba together.
Julie C.}ELMHURST, NY}233}74}3}18}2}7/4/2017}Came back after a few years and I didn't think that the food was worth the price. For soba that is minimum $20, I expected it to be handmade or come with more items. I think I can just buy a pack of soba from the supermarket, cook it al-dente and make it myself. The soup was also too salty. My sister ordered the soba with different types of mushroom and it came missing a mushroom and the other person in our party also didn't have an ingredient in their soba. In conclusion, for the amount of money we spent here, I would rather go to Raku to eat a bowl of piping handmade udon noodles.
Chi T.}New York, NY}108}26}90}-1}4}6/30/2017}Good soba that comes with a hefty price tag. The medium bowl is too much for me but the small one is just too small (lol). Tempura is amazing. I liked the  hot soba a lot.
Orange P.}New York, NY}7}83}143}-1}4}6/30/2017}I really like this place. They have authentic soba noodles and their tempura batter is perfectly light and crispy. I tried their uni soba and their sea bass tempura along with their dinner special. The special is around $25 and includes soba, 2 shrimp tempura, side vegetables like pumpkin and two inari-sweet tofu skin with sushi rice stuffed in it. And also strawberry ice cream. It's very clean and quiet environment.
You Z.}New York, NY}9}51}72}-1}3}6/26/2017Updatedreview}Not my best dinning experience. It was a long wait. The soba was of good quality, but nothing special. And it's way overpriced. The cold soba with uni on top (forgot the name..) didn't have fresh uni. It was a disappointment.
Tseten S.}Queens, Queens, NY}102}73}141}18}4}6/25/2017}We came here on a Saturday around 6 pm. There was still plenty of seats open at this time. We were seated quickly and given hot towels to cleanse our hands. I liked the service here. They were attentive without being too overbearing. I knew I wanted to order their hot soba noodles so I got their Yasai hot noodle dish which came with mixed vegetables and mushrooms. You can pick either udon or soba for the noodle option. I had mine with soba. I particularly enjoyed that my dish came with different types of mushrooms. I'm usually not a fan of mushrooms but in this dish I really didn't mind it. There was also edamame, scallions, onions, cilantro and a few other vegetables that I can't recall. I really liked the soup base of my dish. It was light and had the right amount of salt to accentuate all the other components. I ordered my dish in size small but there are also regular and large sizes. For me this size was perfect. I wish there was a little bit more soba noodles with my dish though. I was left eating more veggies without any noodles left. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!
Ms. F.}New York, NY}0}91}0}-1}4}6/22/2017}Really nice place with very traditional (and fairly long) Japanese menu. I had the cold soba, which was great in this hot weather. The server was very, very friendly and helped me choose my order. Yes, it is not a cheap $10 lunch special kind of place - this is an authentic Japanese restaurant, unlike most in this city. But the quality of the food and service are there. I will certainly return!
Jacqueline Z.}New York, NY}226}6}49}-1}5}6/18/2017}I came here with two other friends on a hot summers day, and all three of us had different kinds of the cold soba. It was some of the best soba I've had. I had the smallest size, because when I had asked the waitress, she said if I wasn't extremely hungry the smallest would probably be enough. Wish I had gotten a larger size, because it was so good that I just kept eating, and was sad when I no longer had any soba left to eat! Haha.My friends had the soba which came with the grated Japanese mountain yam and other things, which was also very tasty according to them. Overall our dishes were cool and refreshing, perfect for the season. We didn't try any other of the dishes outside of the soba, so I can't say much about them. All I can say is the soba is delicious.When your noodles are finished, the waitress comes along with some hot water so you can dilute your dipping sauce and have it as a soup!Towards the end of the meal, I did feel a little urgency to clear the table for waiting customers, but it's understandable because the place was very busy and many people were waiting for our table.If you come in the evening, I would say you're most likely going to expect to have to wait a while, because the place is quite busy and so every time I've come here there's always been a wait. But, the wait is well worth it.
Linda R.}Brooklyn, NY}3}15}37}-1}5}6/17/2017}Food was great.  Hot soba was very rich in flavor and the ambiance was nice.  Reminded me of restaurants I ate at when I was in Tokyo.  Staff was very friendly and specifically our waiter Pete.  Avg dish was approx $15.  I ordered the chicken & garlic hot soba and my fiancé ordered the duck soba.  Both delicious .
Sara C.}Seattle, WA}751}581}809}18}5}6/8/2017}Soba-ya is the absolute real deal!!! Yes, Yelper, it is expensive. But this is honestly the most authentic experience you'll get for soba, stateside.I decided to go all out and ordered the uni tororo as well as the ikura oroshi soba. The uni tororo was super fresh. Plenty of uni in the portion. I was plenty full after the soba dish - the ikura giving way to a perfect balance of saltiness. The service was obnoxiously polite - which I found charming and a bit silly at the same time. Staff is attentive to any needs you may have, and it's clear that the owner runs a tight establishment.
Irene L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}146}119}77}-1}5}6/6/2017}I've been here for lunches and dinners during the week and weekend over the course of several years. The quality has remained consistent (excellent)! Of course I'd recommend ordering the soba. It's what this place is known for! I think the best value is the lunch specials. You can get hot or cold soba with a mini rice bowl and Japanese sides for less than $20! The handmade soba noodles and quality ingredients are hard to beat at that price.There's almost always a wait for dinner times, even on weekdays. Definitely worth the wait, but even better if you come during an off-peak lunch hour and sit down immediately.
Emily C.}New York, NY}637}95}17}18}3}6/5/2017}Got the Sake Oyako Don because I really needed my raw salmon fix (I know what you're thinking...why come to a soba place to get a donburi bowl, but when the cravings hit you do what you can). While the regular portions are a good size, the prices are little high. My bowl was $22, but my friend's Uni soba was $28!! Which I think is ridiculous for what you get, considering that it's soba with a little bit of uni and mountain yam on it.
Yue L.}Northfield, MN}88}116}36}-1}5}6/4/2017}My favorite place so far! I ordered the broiled eel over rice with hot soba and the matcha ice cream, both were super good. Highly recommend this place!
Dorothy Y.}Brooklyn, NY}1}31}58}-1}3}6/3/2017Updatedreview}Friday 1pm. They still had the lunch boxes so we got that. Well like I said last time I was meh about it but I decided to give it a second chance and I still don't like it. Sorry the 3 stars is for the lunch box. I still like the soba and udon. Salad - I don't like the dressing Sweet potato - the other time they had pumpkin, both soft and sweet (y)Marinated lotus root - it's very strong in flavor. I was ok with it the first time but this second time I have to admit I don't like it. Chirashi - the rice cube, the rice is dry and flavorless Salmon - yay for big piece of fish If I only ever tried the lunch box I probably wouldn't go back. At least I know I like their soba and udon. Maybe I'll try the lunch set next time.
Michelle L.}NY, NY}145}48}227}-1}4}5/28/2017}Came here pretty early around 6 on a Friday, and there wasn't much of a wait. When you're seated, you're handed a hot towel to clean your hands - which I thought was nice. The staff is attentive and quick to answer any questions you may have. We tried the squid wrapped rice, I thought the squid was a little overcooked and the rice inside was drowned in sauce so it was soggy and fell out of the squid ring. We also ordered the unaju don (eel over rice) and the stamina seiro. The unaju don still had a lot of small bones in it, but they're edible so that's ok. The portions were kinda small even though I got a regular. The stamina seiro was a soba with a hot dipping sauce of fried chicken and garlic. I thought the fried chicken would be on the side, but it was in the dipping which also made it really soggy. So if you get the stamina seiro, be sure to ask for the chicken on the side. All in all it was pretty good. But it wasn't super filling. So order sets and other side dishes if you have a big appetite!
Kate C.}Boston, MA}0}19}32}-1}2}5/26/2017}Way over-rated, don't understand why this restaurant get such high ratings.  Excited to try this soba restaurant, but very disappointed.   Very over priced for the quality and amount of food you get.  I was still very hungry after dinner, and I don't usually eat a lot.  The soba served hot was probably like 1 oz, I could almost count how many soba.  The soup was like plain water with soy sauce, tasteless.  3 stars are for service and presentation, food is 1 star.  But the most important of a restaurant is food.
Dawn H.}Queens, NY}18}90}332}18}3}5/19/2017}Overpriced Japanese food! Tables were so close the people next to you can join your conversations. They gave use hot towels to clean the hands right after we sat down. Ordered the curry fried pork chop udon, assorted fried appetizer and a tuna rice set. The sauce for the tuna rice was too sweet, nothing but sweetness... tuna was quite fishy, wasn't fresh. The appetizer had good batter, I think it's panko mixed? Curry udon was ok, wasn't bad but not worth the price. Wouldn't come back because there's better options.
Maggie S.}Manhattan, NY}0}13}20}-1}1}5/18/2017}So my friend was really hungry last night and wanted to eat at this place, I had dinner before our meeting but didn't mind to company her. The waitress was rushing us to order, she came to rush us to order maybe like 3-4 times within the first 10 mins. Took a look at the menu, looked good but still not hungry. My friend ordered the Tororo noodle ($18.75), waitress asked me what I wanted and I said I actually didn't want anything and she said "PLEASE ORDER SOMETHING!", I repeated myself telling her that I didn't want anything, she repeated herself with attitude, "WOULD YOU PLEASE AT LEAST ORDER SOMETHING SMALL!". To be honest, I was quite shocked with her BAD manner. Fine, I ordered the Oyako Don out of politeness just to make my friend feel more comfortable. My friend's noodle arrived, and the waitress gave me some sauce and letting me know that it was for my Sake Oyako Don ($11.50), I told her that I didn't order salmon. So on top of being so rude, she was also incompetent (oh no!). My food arrived, I had two bites, the food was decent but I was still in shock of how rude and impolite this waitress was, more surprisingly was that according to her name tag, she is Japanese! I have never met a Japanese person that rude in my the past and I lived in JP for a few years. Would I go back? The food was actually not bad but the answer is "NO!". There are many good spots for authentic JP food in the city, so I don't mind to skip this one :) Be sure that you go hungry if you don't want to get treated poorly. If I could, I I wouldn't tip her!
L L.}New York, NY}25}723}643}-1}2}5/17/2017}The services were good, the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the  menu was adequate and the food was good..    The only problem was the value.   It was expensive for what we got and the portion was very small.   We ordered a rice on the side (costed $3.5 each) and the portion was so small that we were not full afterward.   For over $35 per person, we had to go to another joint afterward (the Belgium fries place in the village) to get full.   I don't think that I will come back.
Daniel C.}New York, NY}287}73}102}-1}4}5/15/2017}I came here with 2 friends on a Wednesday night and when we arrived, the restaurant was packed. The host told us that the wait would be 15 minutes so we sat down and looked at the menu. True to his word, the host called our party and we were seated immediately as the first table of 4 was available. The menu was a bit overwhelming but our server was kind enough to go over the menu with us. After much deliberation, I decided on the Ten Zaru with the regular size soba noodles (150g). The Ten Zaru includes shrimp, shiso, and shisito tempura. The soba was amazing but the highlight of my dinner was definitely the shrimp tempura. These are lightly battered, fried to perfection, and are deliciously flaky. The only downfall is that everything on the menu is a bit pricey, as other Yelpers have mentioned, and is not quite filling for the price you pay.All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and hope to try the hot soba the next time I visit!
Linda T.}Manhattan, NY}26}208}157}-1}2}5/14/2017}Hmmm so what should I say ... I thought the food was just okay. Nothing to rave about. I can't remember anything about my meal except how bland it kind of was. I got the charashi with soba noodles, cold. The sauce that comes with it was extremely bland. The hot soba noodles looked better than any of the cold noodles, so I suggest opting for hot over cold. Mom got the uni soba cold and she didn't enjoy the noodles either. She only ate the uni. Don't think I'd return as nothing was memorable. I probably enjoy soba noodles at the noodle shop on kenmare better.
Jim B.}Richmond Hill, Canada}2}22}1}-1}3}5/4/2017}Service was fantastic but the downside was the food. I thought it was over priced for the regular dinner menu. The special sets they have was definetely worth it. The service was great with the warm moist towel to wipe our hands. But the seating was very tight even as I was tucked all the way in the chair behind me was pushed against mine. The portion was a bit small for the price and not filling at all. It was nice seeing that the noodles were freshly made in house.
Jocelyn K.}Jersey City, NJ}443}810}4544}18}4}5/2/2017}My friend tells me this is one of the oldest spots in East Village still standing, opening in 1998. I knew someone who used to work here as a hostess and she said she met quite a lot of celebrities while working at Soba-ya (to list some: Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, Jonah Hill). That's not the reason why I came, but I wouldn't have minded a celebrity spotting :P.  I came with my group right at 5:30pm when they open on a Thursday, so we were able to get a table immediately. To start, I ordered the Santen-Mori where I could choose three kinds of vegetables. I chose the Kimpira-Gobo Pan Sautéed Mountain Burdock, Satsuma-Imo Glacéed, and Kabocha to Shiitake. The burdock was my favorite of the three because of the cruncy texture. The Japanese sweet potatoes weren't as sweet as I thought. I'd probably skip choosing that next time. I would get the kabocha again.I chose to get a small 100g cold Zaru Soba with nori that comes with a dipping broth with scallions and wasabi. Very simple, but the soba noodles had great texture. They also give you hot water afterwards to pour into the dipping sauce to turn into a soup. The small is actually quite a lot of noodles. I wasn't too full at the end, but I was satisfied. This is a good place to get a healthy meal. If you want to eat a lot, this might not be a good place to go as everything is on the pricey end. I think the lunch specials are a better deal, so I'll have to me back for lunch sometime.
Joey L.}Manhattan, NY}0}11}0}-1}5}4/29/2017}Love this place for authentic Japanese soba and udon. Their lunch set is a great bargain and very filling! Love the tempura soba and salmon don. Service is classic Japanese hospitality, with warm towels and hot tea. Interiors are clean and well run. Will return!
Sara M.}New York, NY}562}64}25}18}2}4/28/2017}The service and atmosphere was ok but the food was just bleh. The hot soba was waaaay too salty. The dipped soba was better but it to was kind of too much. I got the pork Katsu too and that was probably the best thing we got but it was just ok. The part that annoyed me was that they made us wait but I could see empty seats. Personally I wouldn't be back.
Shivangi K.}New York, NY}283}146}53}18}4}4/26/2017}Don't know if I'll be back, but my friend and I stopped in for a Sunday night dinner after the line at Ippudo was awful. Still craving noodles, we looked up our options and stumbled upon the beautifully elegant entrance of Soba-ya. From both an exterior and interior design perspective, Soba-ya's owners knew what they were doing. Food and service-wise, they did well, too. I'd never had Soba before, and, given the name of the restaurant, I figured this was the place to try. That was definitely a good choice! I ordered the Curry Nanban Chicken & Tokyo Negi in Curry Soup which runs $15.75 for the small size (only a few dollars difference between the small, medium, and large). Some of the reviews said the portions were small, but mine was more than enough. The curry was thick and delicious, the noodles were perfectly cooked, as were the chunks of chicken. My only complaint: though high quality, there wasn't much chicken. For my sad, student wallet, I'm not likely to come back too often, but if I do crave Soba, I'll be back at Soba-ya before going anywhere else.
Patrick M.}New York, NY}4}42}181}-1}5}4/22/2017}Great taste. Great soba!   Price is right for the Japanese food. It's good to come for lunch special manual in order to pay less and enjoy more.
James K.}La Palma, CA}2}4}1}-1}4}4/20/2017}Good food, but I do feel the price can be a little bit on the higher end. Very great service, their uni cold soba is my favorite. Their lunch specials are pretty dang good too.
Iceman T.}Haymarket, VA}2}27}1}-1}3}4/16/2017}The place is pretty pricy and service isn't like stellar either. Can't understand what people are raving about.... Food was actually good but not something I would give 5 stars for the price I have paid.
Alice L.}Los Angeles, CA}273}5}8}-1}4}4/15/2017}Food was good & service was good. But the food portions were a lot smaller than I expected and it's pretty pricey for the quantity they give. I loved how they gave us a warm moist towel to wipe our hands before eating. I don't know if that's just Japanese style or just the restaurant but it was pretty convenient that I didn't have to get up to go to the restroom to wash my hands.
Tim R.}Portland, OR}1193}1198}633}18}3}4/13/2017}Solid stuffHad dinner here with my wife and friends. We got to try a few different things. I enjoyed the salmon don, wish I had more. The brulee for dessert was also great. The Tempura Hot Soba and Uni Cold Soba was just ok. Not a fan of cold noodles and the flavor of the sauce. Want to come back for more don though.
Tung D.}New York, NY}337}302}523}18}3}4/10/2017}I thought the food was ok, but it was much more expensive that it deserved. I had the medium-sized Chirashi hot udon with 2 tamgo pieces, some fish cakes, and veggies (no meat/fish in the bowl at all!) for over $20 before tips Besides the overly expensive price, the taste was decent. The udon noodles were fresh, and the texture was just right. Not too chewy or too soft. The tamagos and veggies were kinda sweet. Broth was ok. We also ordered the Uni with yam, the Uni didn't have any flavor, while the yam texture was kinda weird. It was like congee, but it was sticky, drooly, not grainy like congee, and was cold. Just quite weird.
Liz T.}New York, NY}456}151}103}18}2}4/9/2017}I had a pretty disappointing meal here. I got the chicken curry soba and my boyfriend got the kitsune soba. Considering this place has soba in their name, the noodles should be perfectly cooked and their soup should be on point. Unfortunately that was not the case. The noodles were totally overcooked and the broths were bland. The chicken in my soup was rubbery because it was cooked too long. To top it off, each bowl set us back around $23. Definitely not worth it:
Raymond F.}Brooklyn, NY}14}125}0}18}2}4/8/2017}Food is good. Price point is a little high. Service is bad. Ordered Age Tofu Udon* and girlfriend had Chicken Curry Soba. Both tasted good, the soba was especially good. Soup bases were alright, the curry was a little bit bland and the chicken inside was tough and plain. Ordered a seasonal Uni appetizer which was tasty. Also had this with some sake.Overall this place was way too expensive for how their food tasted and what their service was like. Given the food tasted good, it was not worth 20$ for that small a quantity of noodle. The broth itself was decent, but then again you can get that anywhere. The main dishes came out scattered from each other, and we were rushed in finishing our appetizer. If this was a normal place, this would all be fine, BUT for the prices we were paying, that is ridiculous. These two noodles, an appetizer, and the alcohol totaled out to be $87.The only pleasant aspect of this place was the homemade noodles. Everything else was not up to par.
Raph L.}Closter, NJ}0}8}1}-1}2}4/5/2017}The Zaru which is just the noodles with dipping sauce and seaweed was ok. Tasted average maybe a bit bland. It's not really worth the $10 Regular which isn't very filling. The shrimp shumai was delicious 5/5. But soba was eh
Rhea L.}Irvine, CA}3}4}0}-1}1}4/2/2017}I was rushed out by the server during the dinner, they came here so many times trying to take my plate away when I was eating. And I am a fast  eater. What more unbelievable is, when I finished sign my bill the server came and said I must pay AT LEAST 15% tips. I paid about 12%, ($85 in total, I paid $10 tips) because my dinner was so rushed, I didn't feel comfortable the whole process. But eventually I paid what they asked for. I thought the amount of tips is depend on the service customers received, and they should earn the tip by their action. May be I was wrong
Laura O.}Queens, NY}288}499}23}18}4}4/2/2017}Walked by Soba-ya on my way to Veselka a few days ago, bookmarked it, and ended up here last night!This is the kind of place that has the perfect atmosphere, at least in our experience: A nearly full, bustling dining room, that just so happens to have one or two unbooked tables so you can just walk right in. It may not be like this every Saturday evening, but it worked for us.It took a little while for us to place our orders, but once we did, the food came out pretty quickly. I am normally more of an udon person, but when in a restaurant that has "soba" in the name... gotta try it. So I had a small bowl of the hot soba Tanuki (tempura flakes and I think kale?). Although the toppings were few and far between, the flavors were excellent enough to compensate. The soy-infused broth was rich, and the soba noodles were pleasantly al dente. The kale added some crunchiness. Tempura flakes are always a good idea, and I maintain that they added some deliciousness to the broth, but the speed in which they become soggy is rather annoying.I will say that the broth is super salty: Pleasantly so at first, but toward the end of the meal, it got to be a little much. I'd give the soup 4 stars at the beginning of the meal and 3 toward the end. 3.5 stars would be my preferred score, but Yelp forces you to make decisions in life.I also ordered a soba beer (actually called Buckwheat Ale, but called soba beer on the menu), which was actually a bit citrusy. Interesting thing to pair with your noodles, if you want to go for the full buckwheat experience.
Anna C.}Manhattan, NY}278}48}94}-1}5}3/30/2017}Spectacular flavor and generous servings. I have ordered the Zen Taru as well as several other cold soba dishes in the past and highly recommend. The don looks great as well, although I haven't tried. While Soba-ya is usually pricey, the weekday lunch special is well worth stopping by on a slow day.
Tom H.}Great Neck, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}3/27/2017}The service was good, ordered the mushroom hot soba, a bit salty but overall i was satisfied.
Victoria S.}Brooklyn, NY}77}9}1}-1}3}3/17/2017}One impression of soba-ya is that its very crowded and expensive. Ive been several times and i will still go back though. My most recent visit I got the hot soba with tempura. And some uni, grated yam appetizer.The uni grated yam appetizer is something i would not order again.The uni was fresh, sweet, creamy and the yam was what you expect yam to be. The taste was good but the texture i do not like. The yam was gooey and foamy added with uni was a tad weird. If you order this, be sure to use soy sauce. Ties the flavors in better, well gives it flavor.The hot soba was good. Came out steaming hot. The soup was very tasty and a tad salty but not in a way thats bothersome. Has a bit of a roasted flavor to it. The noodle was chewy but also soft.Tempura - comes with 3 shrimps, 1 shiso leaf, 1 shishito pepper. The coating was very light and crispy. One bite and the flakes go everywhere. Yum! The shrimp was bouncy. Leaf was crunchy. Other times  ive been, I've ordered the lunch set. I do not remember much of it except for the dessert, which was really good.I dont remember the name of the dessert, but it was basically  milk pudding with a strawberry (or raspberry, forgot what berry) on top. So good. Very smooth and milky tasting and the tartness of the berry adds a very good flavor. The set came with a small, dainty sized dessert. Ive ordered the full order before and find that i appreciated the small one more. Why? I do not know. Maybe its one of those too much of something good may be bad things...Tl;dr Good, but expensive.
Ara K.}Staten Island, NY}41}20}100}-1}1}3/16/2017}Don't go in night time! Rude service for sure! Rush you to the death! Their kind of service at night: Sit, order, just drop the whole thing in ur mouth as the way they serve you, pay cash, Get out of here! They basically take ur water before u ask for check! Wtf? I sat down by 9pm and leave by 9:23pm. 21mins of diner time! Fast eater EVER! Hurray and they can't even wait until I finish typing! HAHA
Sunny L.}Manhattan, NY}239}30}7}-1}2}3/14/2017}Had the curried chicken udon (nanban). While the ambiance is nice, the food is only okay. The soup was far to salty and the 5 bite size pieces of chicken had no flavor at all! It was very disappointing. In top of that, it's really not worth the price you pay for it. If I could come again, I wouldn't.  It looked like a great place, but I was utterly disappointed.
Khoa N.}New York, NY}83}171}314}18}3}3/11/2017}I did not like it here after my first try a couple years ago, but since the reviews are great I decided to give it another shot. Still, I found the food mediocre for the expensive pricetag that came with it. The soba/udon wasn't bad. It just wasn't exceptional. I'm not sure what the hype is about​ but paying $20 per person for lunch for a bowl of noodles isn't worth it. Especially when I was still hungry afterward. If you want a satisfying bowl of hot noodles for a decent price, this isn't the place for you.
Kathy C.}Philadelphia, PA}0}14}6}-1}2}3/7/2017}Come here for the noodles and prompt service, stay away from the rest of the menu. We ordered some appetizers with the thought that they would be large enough to share--seeing as most were around ~$11-13. The apps were barely enough for 2 people, and we ended up paying $35+ per person for less than spectacular bites of food that were not even enough to fill anyone up! I'd be ok with expensive, small portions if the dishes themselves tasted great. Unfortunately, this was just not the case here.
Karen C.}New York, NY}219}59}291}18}4}3/5/2017}I have come many times but the one thing I get most often is their limited $21 lunch box that comes with a bento box of sushi rice with shredded egg/ikura, broiled fish (usually salmon), various seasonal japanese vegetables, salad with cold tofu, pickles, choice of soba or udon (hot or cold), and veg or shrimp tempura. The meal ends with a small milk pudding/panna cotta dessert with a piece of preserved strawberry. I never really cared for this dessert every time I've come and gotten the lunch box, the strawberry always tasted off. It would be much better if they gave a slice of fresh strawberry instead. Anyway, the lunch box is such a steal!My friend got the hot duck soba and felt so salty when I kept getting dish after dish HAHA. He didn't really enjoy the duck and I tried a piece, it seems like it was coated with some flour? Not a very satisfying bowl. Definitely go for the bento lunch box or their soba + donburi lunch sets :) My friend ended his meal with the green tea crème brulée and it was delicious! Not too sweet, strong matcha taste. I have also tried their maguro don, super fresh tuna! I do like that they make their soba in house but they don't have my favorite soba noodles. I've tried many throughout the city since soba is my all time favorite kind of noodles (I am a self proclaimed soba connaisseur). I like my soba to have a chewy consistency because that's what makes them so addicting when dipped into the cold tsuyu, but I found soba-ya's noodles lacking. I love soba-ya because they have a variety of dishes and you can get donburi/soba sets, but I don't come for their soba alone, which is why I can't give this restaurant full stars!
P L.}Brooklyn, NY}2}194}172}-1}2}3/3/2017}This is a really expensive for an ok meal.  We came on Friday just before 6pm.  By 630, it was packed.  Service is good, but nothing to write home about.  We ordered two different bowls of soba and the mix tempura.  Everything is prepared well and presented in very elegant manner, but the taste is just ok.  Nothing wow or knocks your socks off.  For this price point, I can get tastier soba a few blocks away.  Maybe the location warrants it, but I've had the same quality, if not better, Japanese food for half the price.We won't be back very soon.
Jenny L.}Manhattan, NY}461}68}46}-1}2}3/3/2017}This 2 stars is NOT for the food. The food is solid and the tempura is probably the best I've had. Food is awesome, lunch box special is a great deal. FOOD GETS SOLID 5 STARS.The service is what prompted me to write this review. I went for lunch and when the bill came, I paid and tipped 15%. A few minutes later, one of the employees came up to me and said "was the service okay?", and then went away. And then a minute later, the same person came up again and said "an 18% tip is required", pointing to the portion of the receipt that said "Suggested Gratuity". It was a $1 difference, so that's not what bothered me. The issue was that I was told I was REQUIRED to give a certain amount of gratuity. I paid the difference because a dollar wasn't worth the argument, so I guess here I am on Yelp expressing my discontentment about it instead. So yeah, the service was fine until I was confronted about having to pay a required amount for tip. I have never been told that before, and having been a waitress myself, think that is kinda rude and weird to be demanding a certain amount of tips from a customer.
Jackie Z.}Manhattan, NY}64}8}2}-1}3}2/24/2017}I tried the vegetable soba after research on so many good reviews about it. It is way below my expectation.It has a lot of vegetables, but the soup is too plain. Double checked with the waiter and he confirmed that it's a bonito based soup. But I can hardly taste any and no flavor of scallion. If I didn't order the soft-boiled egg, this dish would taste like noodle in soy sauce water. I'd recommend the soba restaurant near MOMA, where they know how to cook an authentic full flavor soba broth. The problem with that store is there is not many topping like Sobaya.
Buo Z.}New York, NY}490}921}703}-1}4}2/16/2017}Uni soba was delicious with extra sweet uni and the soba soup with the flakes was delicious. The ankimo was good too. Green tea ice cream here isn't that great - kind of chalky.
Nian Z.}Brooklyn, NY}1}46}5}-1}2}2/14/2017}If this is what soba tastes like, then apparently I'm not a fan of soba! Severely disappointed by the sour broth, just wasn't expecting that and it didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Soba isn't supposed to be slightly bitter, is it? At least, not the kind I've had in the past . . . I had the tempura soba ($25) and the tempura was freaking amazing though. Ridiculously crunchy and flavorful, and surprisingly not tooooo greasy, I had so much fun eating this that I left my soba pretty much untouched and feeling quite hungry after paying a ridiculous bill :( Friend ordered the stamina soba ($20) and I'd say bad choice because it's pieces of fried chicken in your bowl of noodles, which means the fried breaded chicken becomes lumpy and tasteless. Probably doesn't belong in a soba, or at least could've been served on the side, like the tempura?Seating is super tight, I almost knocked over my neighbor's bowls when I tried exiting from an inside seat and trust me, I ain't that fat!
Julie C.}Brooklyn, NY}180}97}217}18}4}2/13/2017}This is a small Japanese restaurant and not meant for large groups. Luckily, I did my Yelp research prior to suggesting it to my friends. My party of 3 got seated after 20mins of wait. We asked right away if the lunch box special was still available and was surprise to find out at 2pm, we can still order it. It was a good variety of food for the set price of $21 and also includes a small dessert. The set comes with shrimp tempura, hot or cold soba or udon, broiled salmon just to name a few. Both the food and portion is decent. I chose hot udon and don't regret not getting soba. The noodle texture was just right, not soggy which is normally the problem I have at other udon spots. The broiled salmon was season perfectly, not too salty and I balanced it with the mini chirashi rice it came with. Unexpectedly, it came with a small strawberry milk tofu pudding and that was the highlight of my lunch! It was delicious, refreshing and just the perfect way to end our meal.Overall, the food and the value of the lunch box was good. I would like to go back to try other items on the menu as well. Until next time Soba-ya!
Little Miss L.}Manhattan, NY}19}171}5}-1}4}2/12/2017}Great service, awesome food! They only have soba and udon as their options, no ramen. I was craving for ramen but soba did the trick. Their small bowl is actually enough for one unless you're really really hungry. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.
Christy D.}Manhattan, New York, NY}188}6}4}-1}5}2/11/2017}The best Ramen I've had in a very long time and I must say that they have out done themselves ! The customer service is great and the food is beyond wonderful !
Reema H.}Washington, DC}32}125}179}-1}5}2/10/2017}Smaller groups get seated quicker! Keep it to 2-3 max. That being said, I've always found a seat after waiting at most 20 minutes. It's definitely worth the wait. I used to go here all the time and bring friends and everyone always enjoyed the authentic ambiance and good quality noodles. We even got to see them being made fresh by a master! It was mesmerizing and so laborious, which equals = amazing noodles. I have never had anything that wasn't good. I would recommend cold soba to be adventurous and if you are a newbie to Japanese food. I love their hot udon with the variety of mushrooms. And their vegetables tempura is also really good. I haven't gotten their sushi before but this place is known for their noodles and it would be blasphemous not to order one dish of noodles. This is my go-to spot for a sit down enjoyable noodle experience. You're missing out if you don't eat here, says a major food snob.
Solah H.}New York, NY}39}89}287}18}4}2/5/2017}as a big fan of soba, i wud love to go back. i had tororo which is cold soba with yam. it was very good since i love yam. the noodle was very fresh and chewy. my friends had curry udon tuna avocado don. they were good too! for appetizer, we had the tofu ($7). the size portion wise you prob want to get regular size. the small wud be too small. we arrived around 6 on friday night, and soon after we got the table it was packed!
Lillian Z.}San Francisco, CA}694}173}56}18}3}2/5/2017}I had been meaning to try Soba-ya for a while. Although it is (as its name indicates) known for its soba, I actually had a bowl of udon when I came for a late dinner Friday night (no wait!). A warm bowl of udon is great on a cold winter night, but this was nothing particularly special. I think that it's a good bowl of udon, but for the price (~$20) I would have expected something a bit more special. Would certainly come again, but my 3 stars is more for the lack of great value. Compared to some of the 4 or 5 star udon places out there, it's just average. Can't speak on the soba though -- I'll need to come back again for that!
Judy N.}Brooklyn, NY}307}93}290}-1}4}2/4/2017}Who would have thought it would be so hard to find a restaurant to eat at in New York City? Well, that was our dilemma on January 2nd. We have learned our lesson that Jan 2nd is still considered part of New Year's and to call ahead to make sure the restaurant is open. Luckily Soba-ya came to the rescue! It was around 1pm and we were starving - the restaurant was packed and I was told it would be around a 45 minute wait. You gave them your phone # and they text you when your table was ready (love technology). We wanted to try the lunch box special ($21 and only 25 servings a day) but since they were open for over an hour, we didn't have high hopes. We asked anyway and got lucky! What the lunch box comes with: TempuraSoba (Hot or Cold, I got cold)Small SaladSalmon Yuuan-YakiMini ChirashiAssorted vegetablesThe box was perfect to try and have a little bit of everything. However, I was disappointed with the "mini chirashi" because I was expecting a little more than a cube of solid rice. Not mentioned was the small dessert it came with! We had, what I think was, pickled strawberry and tofu/panna cotta in a cute little jar. Overall, it was a lot of food and very tasty. Maybe I was really hungry, but I finished everything in the lunch box!
Jenna M.}Brooklyn, NY}95}7}19}-1}5}1/29/2017}One of the rare Japanese restaurants that actually serves soba. I love the exterior and interior of this place, it really sends out the authentic Japanese vibe. They serve you green tea upon seating. Their broth was sooo good! It is a little on the pricy side but trust me, it is worth the trip over.
Ada Y.}New York, NY}31}337}38}-1}3}1/26/2017}I've been to many Japanese restaurant and was very disappointed about the  meal here. Spent over $100 for it too. It seems like the idea of homemade noodle was what was appealing. I tried a bunch of things. The broth was just soy sauce in water and the menu did not include info about it or i would not have choose it.There was no noodle show that evening. Notsure if they normally do that in the evening. There was no waiting time since we went early evening but it can packed once we got seated.
Kevin C.}Queens, NY}204}121}1262}18}3}1/24/2017}Not particularly impressed with soba-ya despite how popular it is. I got here on a Wednesday night at 5:30 with my friends because we heard there's usually a long line outside. Much to our surprise there were barely any people, so if anyone is planning to come here you don't have to rush.3 of us got the dinner special, and my friend got the duck soba with the hot dipping sauce. The dinner special comes with a plate of cold veggies, and I enjoyed all of them except for the lotus root. The dinner set comes with fresh soba, choice of hot or cold soup, tempura, and inari sushi. The Inari was great, and so was the tempura. It was lightly battered and crispy golden, perfect! I also got the braised pork belly with a soft boiled egg.However, the biggest disappointment was the soba. It wasn't very bouncy, and it was pretty tasteless. I feel that soba differentiates itself from other noodles by having this nutty flavor that is super unique. However, the soba here lacked that completely, and tasted super plain (just like store bought soba would). For a restaurant that prides itself on the soba I am very disappointed. Even a bit of salt while cooking the noodles would have helped bring out that flavor a bit.The braised pork belly however was very good. It comes in a stone pot with a sweet broth and a soft boiled egg. The pork was perfectly tender, the sauce was great, and the egg was a perfect compliment to the richness of the pork and sauce. This I would recommend.The dinner set also comes with a scoop of ice cream, which was whatever. It's ice cream lolPerhaps even worse than the soba was the waiter. He was so bizarre, kept hovering over our table for some reason. He came to take away some plates when we were done with some of our items, and when I told him I wasn't done yet, he backed off but kept hovering next to our table for 2 minutes. I felt like I was being pressured to finish my food quickly for some reason, but I ignored him and just left my food there. The guy kept walking around like he had nothing to do. The restaurant wasn't even half full at this point, so I have to take off a star for his behavior and service. So weird and uncomfortable. Overall, I think soba-ya is a pass. For the price you are paying (my dinner set and pork belly came over to over $40), the quality of the food and service just doesn't hit the spot. The soba was super disappointing. The other items were good, but the service was poor. I hope he gets Retrained or something.
Kimberly C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}217}11}6}-1}5}1/24/2017}Me and my boyfriend's go-to cold soba shop! We love our experience every time. My favorite rice dishes are the Tuna Steak Don and Sake Oyakodon. Tuna Steak slices are tender and delicious. The sauce they have go great with the dish, and I sometimes even ask for extra. As for the Sake Oyakodon, the salmon slices are super fresh, juicy, and t h i c c. They're also quite generous with the amount of salmon, so that's always good. My favorite cold soba dish is the Yamakake. The grated mountain yam provides a delightful texture and freshness. The cured tuna is super good. Nice, thick, and juicy.As for dessert, the Green Tea Brulée is always good. The matcha they use here is very rich and not too sweet. Their icecream is great too. My personal favorite is the black sesame: just the right amount of sweetness with a nice roasted flavor. The green tea/matcha icecream is good too. Like the brulée, very rich and not too sweet.
Lana L.}Manhattan, NY}79}56}35}-1}3}1/15/2017}Really average. Not bad but not particularly good soba. Avoid the tempura unless you have a deadly Oil Deficiency.
Matt I.}Philadelphia, PA}116}18}5}-1}2}1/8/2017}Overcooked noodles, overpriced dishes, overrated restaurant. I came expecting some authentic soba and udon dishes but left asking myself how so many other reviewers and the Michelin Guide could come to recommend the place. My fiance and I came on a busy Wednesday night and were seated immediately. Perusing the menu, the first thing that caught our eye was the $20-ish price for any bowl of soup, significantly more than what had been posted on Google. Still, if it's Michelin Guide recommended, it must be good, right? We ordered a hot chirashi soba soup and a nabeyaki udon. The soup broth used in both soups was, to my surprise, dull and uninteresting, with each bite consisting of a sour taste that had some hint of woodiness, yet no further depth, smokiness, umami, or richness to keep your interest. For some reason, it tasted as if the soup base for both were the same, even though, in my experience, nabeyaki udon should utilize a fish-based dashi. Perhaps even worse than our problems with the soup broth was the low quality of the noodles. The udon was clearly overcooked: rather than being chewy and flavorful, they were instead mushy and soft, breaking apart easily with every bite. The soba wasn't any better, with no interesting flavor or texture to brag about. The toppings for each soup were equally uninspired with no depth of flavors to keep you coming back for more bites. In the end, we both left a disappointing of the soup broth in our bowls, uninterested in stomaching the remaining sour soup.At the end of the meal, we asked about the 50% off desserts that we saw on pictures the business had posted on Yelp, but they told us that that special was only for Wednesday lunch. That was news to us, seeing as how the photos online do not specify this caveat, but we were frankly happy to leave the restaurant as quickly as possible after throwing down about $60 for some of the worst Japanese soups we had ever had.The decorations and atmosphere may seem authentic, but you shouldn't have to look far to get better food than this.
Amelia T.}Manhattan, NY}9}32}41}-1}2}1/7/2017}More like soba-nah. Honestly don't know what the hype is about. I ordered the curry soba and it was really thick and not very flavorful at all. Also overpriced.
Shawn N.}McLean, VA}0}16}0}-1}4}1/1/2017}Came here for lunch on New Year's Day. Yes it was open.I ordered lunch set and I was very content with the quantity and quality.I got cold soba so I can dip the noodle into the sauce. I was full after the meal and also got free tiny dessert, milk pudding.I highly recommend this place if you are in NYU area.
Chin Chun L.}San Diego, CA}0}1}0}-1}1}1/1/2017}Welcome to the racist restaurant. I do not know why the host seated two white americans first while we already waited in the restaurant for 15 mins. Maybe this is the vibe in new york city and I will have to get used to it.
Willy X.}London, United Kingdom}772}185}74}18}2}1/1/2017}Soboya is just another Japanese restaurant with nothing super special. I got some special lunch bento box that had a vegetable of which they only make 25 servings of a day but idk why they make so little because it kind of just tasted like pickled green veggies. Included in the bento box was also a serving of salmon (not crazy or anything), tempura, and udon.As far as authenticity goes I'd say this probably hits the nail on the head. Not only was the space small and quaint like a Japanese establishment it also offered a lunch special with a rice bowl and a side of noodles! Noods! If my time in Japan was any indication, the amount of carbs really reflevts authentic Japanese cuisine. Alas on a cold winter's day got tea and warm udon were beautiful. Yet still nothing super special.
P L.}King of Prussia, PA}0}2}0}-1}1}12/26/2016}Food poisoning! After leaving Soba-ya and on my way walking back to my car parked in Little Italy, I'm hovering over a toilet from extreme nausea. It's been two hours now and the nausea has not yet subsided, and the stomach cramps has turned even more painful. I like to say that I'm a fairly heathy human being with a pretty good immune system, in fact, I've eaten all over the world (even in holes in the walls and street food in 3rd world countries) and this is the first time I've ever gotten food sickness.This place actually deserves a NEGATIVE ONE STAR.On top of the food poisoning about half an hour after we finished dinner there, other qualities, just as equally bad, contributed to the negative one star review.1. The service: The hostess was attending to the texts on her personal phone more than to the customers walking in. The waiter, although nice, had a heavy accent and more than once did we have to ask again what he said.2.  The food: We ordered Chirashi and Tanuki hot soba noodle soup. The Chirashi lacked flavor and the Tanuki was EXTREMELY SALTY. I'm the type of person that loves to drink all the soup, especially on a cold winter night like tonight, but was truly disappointed that the soup was not palpable at all, it felt like they added heaps of salt without even trying the soup. Never in my life did I have to drink multiple glasses of water after eating a soup dish!3. They charge for soda refills without warning!I don't normally write reviews but this horrible experience at Soba-ya prompted me to warn the food patons of nyc!
Michelle Q.}Oakland Gardens, NY}551}12}0}-1}3}12/18/2016}I came here on a double date with my best friend and her boyfriend. I've been meaning to visit this place from good things I've heard from other friends. We got seated fairly quickly because we came in right when they opened for dinner. Soon after, the restaurant was crowded and it looked like there was a long wait. The restaurant is small and didn't look like there was much room to wait for a table.I decided to get the hot Chirashi udon. At first, I really liked it but the more I had it, it became very bland? It wasn't anything special. It didn't look like anyone else loved their dishes either.I probably won't come again because the place is a bit pricey for mediocre food but if I do, I'll probably try the cold soba instead.
Helen K.}Atlanta, GA}134}480}4569}18}2}12/17/2016}Hate to say it, but I did not like this place at all...Initially went to Rubirosa but with a long long wait time we decided to give Soba-ya a chance.Soba-ya is located in Japan town and is a tiny restaurant that can fit around 50 ppl.Luckily we didn't have a wait when a party of 2 went at 730 and service was fine but we must had high hopes for the uni soba, or soba in general for what its worth.We ordered an appetizer of mixed veggies/shrimp tempera plate which came with 2 gigantic shrimps and about 5 veggies consisted of broccoli, carrot, sesame leaf, eggplant, and shishito pepper.  While bigger than norm, the shrimp didn't have much flavor and temperas overall was overly greasy.Next came our anticipated soba.  I predicted that I wouldn't like the yam paste and I was right but had already coaxed the soba with it.  At first it was edible but after couple bites, the slimy texture was way too overbearing for us to eat.  Not sure what a good soba tastes like but soba itself was nothing special at all either and I would rather eat the prepackaged one where you just boil the noodles.  Only reason that I didn't give a 1 star was the uni quality itself and that's the only thing we fished out from our bowls.  I'm not sure how this place got such good ratings or many reviews but I can make better soba at home.  In the end, I washed down the bad taste with a coke.  I spent $100 on a meal that I hated and started off on a bad note on our first night in NY.
Rosamund P.}Jersey City, NJ}0}22}0}-1}5}12/14/2016}I ordered the Jyako-Ten Baby Sardine & Mitsuba Leaf Tempura, my friend ordered Una Ju Broiled Eel Over Rice.Both super tasty. Highly recommended.Will definitely go back and try their other dishes.
Cece C.}Hackensack, NJ}0}2}1}-1}4}12/13/2016}my friend told me the food is good here，so I try the uni cold soba， I think the hot soba will be better in winter.Lol... the food so fresh!
Danielle S.}Brooklyn, NY}298}29}0}-1}3}12/11/2016}REALLY good soba noodlesI got there a little before 7 and they still let us order the early bird dinner. For $22 this dinner special was a heaping amount of food, but I think next time I'll just get the noodles separately. The appetizers were nice, the tempura was under-seasoned and a little bland. The noodles were definitely the best part.
C S.}New York, NY}0}14}0}-1}1}12/11/2016}Cockroach alert! Visited Soba-ya yesterday at 6.30pm, our party of four was seated at the back corner, last table across from the kitchen. After dessert I noticed something moving up the wall to my left, sure enough it was a roach! Thank goodness I do not have phobia... I grabbed a napkin, grabbed the roach (aka killed it), called over the waitress and told her what happened while handing it over to her. You would think she would tell the manager and that someone will come to apologize right away. But no, they were trying to rush us out after only 45mins of being there so that they can turn tables around quickly (not just us but everyone). The bill came -- full bill, nothing comped even though we had a cockroach at our table-- and we paid. Another waiter, 15 mins later, came over to apologize and asked if we wanted dessert on the house. I told him that the bill was already paid and the manager should have came over 15mins earlier to apologize. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip (and I am a great tipper because I worked in the service field in my early years). We left but stayed in front of the restaurant for a few minutes discussing what the hell just happened. About 3 mins later the waitress comes out asking for her tip. Are you kidding me?! Did you just forget that a cockroach was sitting at dinner with us? Did you forget that you didn't call over the manager? Did you forget that instead of apologizing you were trying to rush us out? The manager should tip you, not me! I told her to get the manager as I waited outside and of course he didn't show himself. Why would he if he didn't have the nerve to come to the table to apologize. There are many great restaurants in this neighborhood, avoid this one. Plus, their food is not that great.
Anita L.}Irvine, CA}1353}4058}3680}18}3}12/9/2016}Was super stoked to come here and arrived early in order to secure a table. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly. We ordered some appetizers: fish cake, tempura, but we were here for the soba noodles.One of us had the soba set while the others had a variation. Duck noodles was one, another was a cold mountain yam and uni soba noodles.I must admit, the soba noodles were really disappointing. Every single one of us got soba that was on the mushy side, even the cold version. I do commend them on the broth though because that was fantastic. I'm not sure I would wait in line for this. I'm glad we came, but gauging from the texture of the soba, I am not in a rush to return.
Bunny B.}Las Vegas, NV}42}40}7}-1}5}11/30/2016}It's been a week since we were here and I am still dreaming about their cold soba. Seriously, it was that good! We visited NYC last week and made sure to stop by this place to try out the soba, and boy were we not disappointed! I got the tempura and cold soba, while hubby got the garlic chicken and hot soba. We also ordered the crispy salmon for our appetizer, and it was delicious. Anyway, back to the soba! The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the dipping sauce/broth for the noodles was simply delectable. Service was great, though we had to wait a while to be seated since it was understandably busy considering it was a Saturday night. We just couldn't get enough of it, so my husband and I decided to have dinner there before going home the next day. This time, we got agedashi tofu, hubby got the duck with hot soba, and I got the tempura and cold soba again (don't judge me :), the crunch of the tempura paired perfectly with the noodles). Our server that night was on top of everything, and like the last time we were there, everything tasted great. I am craving it right now, and I'm sooo sad that there are no good soba places here in Vegas. Highly recommend this place to everyone!
Christine Y.}Manhattan, NY}216}90}251}-1}5}11/27/2016}Get the lunch bento box!! It's so worth it because there's so much food! Within the bento box, I got the hot udon but tbh it was too salty for me. But that's how I feel about Japanese ramen as well so normally I don't drink the broth. I love the vegetables and the salmon. It was cooked perfectly and very well seasoned. What I didn't expect was the tempura. The batter around the tempura was very light and crispy. I didn't mind finishing the whole thing because I felt the oil was clean. Just when we thought we were done, dessert came!! I was super delighted and even though my tummy was bloated, there's always room for dessert hehe :). The restaurant was full around 12:30 (30 mins after they opened for lunch). So come early if you want to get yummy udon of soba!!
Allison B.}Atlanta, GA}27}71}0}-1}3}11/27/2016}It's fine. *shrugs* Kind of underwhelming and overpriced, but that's the neighborhood.
Zhicao F.}Baltimore, MD}61}162}87}18}4}11/25/2016}Had a quick dinner here with my friend. The place was really crowded with people on a Friday evening. We had to wait For me I had an edamame starter, and a duck namban （南蛮）hot soba (thin noodle) soup with a baby sardine tempura. The edamame tasted good, and the flavor was just right, not too salty nor too bland. The duck namban noodle was excellent: rich, hot and clear broth, smooth noodle, and duck slices with perfect balance of fat and red meat. That baby sardine tempura was definitely a plus, fried with crispy skin but refreshing inside. I also had a sake lime cocktail, but that was a bit disappointing. The sour lime and bitter-sweet sake kind of cancelled each other out and the flavor remained ambiguous. Perhaps they did not use the best sake for this cocktail, but I'd expect a better drink. All in all, a very good place for Japanese food near NYU!
Urinka H.}New York, NY}115}62}58}18}4}11/23/2016}Always order the warm duck soba. Normally I don't bother finishing up soup but at this place, I enjoy the very last drop with Soba-Yu. Seen many single eaters at the counter bar too, for those who would rather come and simply enjoy the taste of it, this is the place to come. It'll be perfect if it isn't as noisy as it's been though. (Maybe I'm just being too Japanese.)
Sandii L.}New York, NY}15}15}19}-1}5}11/20/2016}I will definitely come back. Yes. Yess. Yesss. I started off with the seasonal special uni jelly, which was what I personally thought sounded odd, but when I actually tried it, it was definitely an experience. The jelly was savory flavored which was different from what we are all familiar with. Although it was pretty pricey, they gave a generous portion of uni which matched perfectly with the jelly. The appetizer was topped off with FRESH wasabi, which the flavor seemed to override the uni. I ordered a duck cold soba which was deliciousssssssss. The duck broth was warm and flavorful and the duck was on point that evening. I got like 7 pieces of duck (yes I counted, because I'm stingy like that) in it which I thought was plenty enough, but who wouldn't mind more!?My boyfriend ordered a tempura hot soba, which came with a variety of vegetable tempuras and two shrimp tempura. His was great as well. Overall I loved it there, the staff was super nice and friendly and diligent. Always filling our cups. It is around $20 per person if you only order only one entree, so to me it's kind of leaning on the pricier side. BUT GOOD THING IS, during weekdays there's a dinner time special I believe that ends around 7? And that menu ( we went on a weekend) seemed great too! So I'm definitely bringing myself back soon!!!
Anny P.}Brooklyn, NY}11}65}84}-1}4}11/19/2016}Yummy Yummy Soba. If you're in the mood for delicious soba this is a must-try. I enjoyed the uni appetizer... Def try it. The tomago egg was just ok but the soba noodles yes it's so good. I would go for the fried bean curd soba for starters and for a more flavorful broth get the duck. The duck isn't one that I'm used to eating but it was a good complement to the soba. Give this spot a try, come right when it opens and you'll be able to grab a seat rightaway.
Lucy D.}Utopia, Queens, NY}1}16}1}-1}4}11/18/2016}I have been coming here for few years now and I don't know why, but every time I am around St Mark's I end up here. Well, I guess it's because It is really good. I have tried few things on their menu and I do think their cold or hot sobas are very good! But, I love the spicy salmon tartare don!!! If you are looking for an alternative to their sobas or you just want to try something new, please try the salmon tartare don.
Ruby S.}Manhattan, NY}384}173}330}-1}4}11/17/2016}Yum! When a place does one thing, they usually do it really well. And every time I pass this place, it's always poppin'. I finally got in, and omg. No time to waste, let's talk food.Buta-Kakuni A+This is braised pork belly with poached egg in broth. Omg. Omg. I don't know if I have the vocabulary to describe this dish. It's $12.50 but it is worth your hard earned money. The broth is incredibly thick and rich. The fat from the pork adds so much flavor, and the meat is melt in your mouth. The only way to really understand the beauty of this dish is to try it.Wakame ASeaweed, konbu kelp, and sesame seeds. Hot or cold out, I'll eat this any day. The broth was very flavorful but not overpowering at the same time. I would suggest eating the noodles first. After a while, they soak up too much of the soup and become soggy. The noodles were perfectly chewy and the simplicity of the dish really let the ingredients shine.The interior is wood, all wood and more wood. You are served your food in a tray, but the food is really good if you're a noodle fan or noodle soup fan. Soba noodles are gluten free* for my gluten free friends out there. I'd like to hear an excuse not to go.
Kim Hai T.}New York, NY}21}10}0}-1}1}11/12/2016}Food here is horrible .. Not really fresh and the soba is too salty. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Curry we had here was horrible too.
Harlan H.}Brooklyn, NY}17}57}4}-1}1}11/11/2016}My dining companion clearly stated a food allergy, to onions. The waiter indicated that he understood and would ensure that there was none of the offending item in the tempura. However, there was a large piece of onion in the tempura. The manager had to be prompted to comp the dish, and only offered to comp the meal as we were leaving.People with food allergies should not eat here.
Cindy X.}Manhattan, NY}127}236}402}18}4}11/6/2016}Took a friend here for his birthday, not as packed as I thought it would be on a Saturday night. You leave your name and number and they will text you when your table is almost ready. We sat at the bar and I personally like sitting at bars because you have one wait staff taking care of you. The service was really nice. At the start, the waitress gave us hot steamy towels to wipe out hands. I really like their decor. It feels like I'm in Japan.The prices of the soba ain't cheap. It's like $20 for soba and soup but I gotta say the hot soba broth have so much flavor. I actually wanted to try the rice bowls but since this place is known for its handmade soba, I thought I give it a try.I ordered the kinoko soba and my friend ordered the soba with the duck slices. We also ordered a tempura appetizer. The tempura is crunchy but nothing special.  The soba broth tasted very clean and everything tasted delicious but I felt it was a little too plain, like there's only a few pieces of mushrooms. It was good but I don't if it's worth $20 for plain noodles and soup. I felt content after I left the place. I'll try their rice dish next time. This 4 stars is for the food and service but 3 stars for price.
May C.}Manhattan, NY}57}100}100}-1}2}11/4/2016}Service was fantastic. People were nice and took care of you. Hot towels at the start. Didn't like the food, however. Got the regular sized "stamina" soba. The chicken tasted weird and I wasn't a fan of the soup taste. Also got an appetizer (forgot the name) which was just alright. Don't think it's worth the money. Can definitely get cheaper and better soba in the city.
Jay H.}New York, NY}46}162}40}18}4}11/4/2016}Love this place, especially their diva special for lunch or dinner! It's worth the pricy aftermath. Great seating and attention detailed staff. The restaurant is very traditional Japanese and there's always a long line so def come early and come hungry! I had shrimp tempera soba, three course meal with ice cream etc and it was great , I've been a regular since I tried this place many years ago!
Lucy N.}New York, NY}704}308}3503}18}4}11/2/2016}Got here at 6 and it was pretty empty but by 7, this place was 100% packed on a Wednesday night. Their insane early bird dinner special that runs from 5-7 easily brings all the foodies to the yard. Is it just me or do you feel less guilty after inhaling a bowl of soba instead of ramen?Goma Ae ($7) - Boiled spinach mixed w/ sesame sauce. This is one of my favorite Japanese appetizers. Highly recommend to start off your meal.3 course Early Bird Dinner ($22) - You get pickled veggies, shrimp & veggie tempura, 2 inari sushi, choice of cold or hot soba, vanilla ice cream. Every aspect of this meal was delicious. The pickled veggies are so simple yet were probably my favorite part of the meal. They even hook it up with 2 shrimps in the tempura. This is easily the best dinner deal in East Village. If I'm mistaken, please let ya girl now.Curry Nanban Chicken & Tokyo Neg in Curry Soup ($15.75) - We ordered a small but it was still so much food. This is definitely enough for one person. The broth was thick and tasty but the chicken was flavorless and we only had 4 pieces of chicken in the bowl. This was one of those dishes that I would have gotten tired of eating if it was all I ordered. Will def be back to try the other soba options![TIP] Split the 3 course dinner and an additional soba between 2 people to get the best deal and try more of the menu!
Heather L.}New York, NY}244}14}2}-1}4}11/2/2016}Sobaya is so delicious! Their soba here is amazing and I am so glad that I found a place that actually takes pride in making their own soba -- and well at that. The dishes here may be a little pricey but the food is always fresh and tastes so natural and healthy. Amazing!
Eddie R.}Brooklyn, NY}123}11}4}-1}3}10/31/2016}Food and service are both on a really good level, but their prices are ridonculously outrageous. Bowls of noodles start at $12 and comes in three sizes (small, regular, large), however that ONLY includes broth and noodles. You want something that has any type protein for instance? Best serve up at least $18, adding two (slightly overcooked) pieces of duck is a whopping $5. Now, I'm not trying to suggest that a great bowl of noodles wouldn't be worth this price tag, but this bowl is not the one.
Vin K.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}144}3}0}-1}3}10/26/2016}This is my first review ever and I'm sad to review this restaurant because I've been going to sobaya for years and used to love it. However, recently they had a price increase with the quality of food lowered. I think it's attributed to rush hour during the weekend but I'm not sure~ I just felt like the care given with the food before was exceptional and for years the quality was consistent. The price increase was a surprise, but made sense in that I'm sure they're trying to stay in the business, but with that increase nothing changed, in fact I felt like they've neglected the core of what they used to be. Today I sat down and to my surprise, there was a small cockroach on the wall. Yep. They killed it and moved on like nothing had happened. I'm sad to say I won't be coming back for a long while~
Flora T.}Philadelphia, PA}6}23}0}-1}5}10/25/2016}Order the hot soba with tempura. The soba is very fresh and so is the tempura, which tastes great without extra oil.
Laura S.}Manhattan, NY}213}356}630}18}3}10/24/2016}First time having soba despite my obsession with Asian food. Soba is definitely an interesting flavor and like a lighter version of ramen. The flavor seems concentrated with a dark soy sauce or something.I thought the noodles were very well made and delicious. That's what you expect when they make it fresh! I got the fried chicken and garlic cold soba noodles $16. It comes with a hot dipping sauce with the fried chicken already in there. I love love love green onions and garlic, but they put a little too much in the dipping sauce and it was a bit overpowering. The overall flavor was just a little off to me.
J C.}New York, NY}6}117}2}-1}5}10/21/2016Updatedreview}My God, even after all these years, they've managed to surprise me with their broth. My latest visit, I ordered the fried chicken hot soba. The broth was incredible, the yuzu citrus note was strong and lovely. Normally, I get the duck hot soba, but I am so glad I tried something new.Soba-ya keeps proving itself they have what it takes to run a successful restaurant in this town. I will keep eating here.*Mental note to self, early bird dinner specials before 7pm, 3-courses for $22.
Yumi K.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}1}-1}2}10/19/2016}This place used to be so good but has gone downhill. It's too bad because the soba and udon of good quality it they would focus more on making the broth to match. Many appetizers are tasteless. I asked for grated daikon which is normally used in the tempura dipping sauce and they said I had to pay extra! I had to ask for the tempura sauce too. I think they do not realize that people know real Japanese food and they try to get away with a lot.  The lunch set might provide a lot of variety but the food looks better than it tastes.
Jenny P.}Washington, DC}193}652}621}18}3}10/9/2016}On a 7 pm on a Friday night, we luckily got seats at the bar. I ordered the curry udon. The $$ signs here are rather misleading as most of the udon bowls start at $15 for the small. I understand that it is high quality soba + udon noodles, but my udon was way overcooked and lost that plump chewiness. Although I enjoyed the velvety texture of the curry broth, it was rather one note. The curry udon is bare bones, with just Japanese scallions and chicken, which did not offer any textural contrasts. I would think for $15, there would be fish cake for a salty element or fresh bean sprouts for some crunch.We also split an uni appetizer with mountain yam. I thought the uni was absolutely fresh and its delicate texture was complemented very well by the porridge-like mountain yam. This was garnished with seaweed - beautiful to the eyes and and taste buds!
Renana M.}Manhattan, NY}7}14}8}-1}4}10/9/2016}The best Japanese restaurant I have been in East Village.  My husband took the Odon noodles and I took the tempura vegetables with rice,both were excellent
H A.}Manhattan, NY}54}41}38}-1}5}10/9/2016}My favorite Soba place in the city!! They know the right way to serve Japanese Soba. Very authentic! Appetizers are also delicious! My favorite dish is Kamo-Nan Soba with duck or Nameko mushroom Soba. Lunch menu is different from dinner, try both!
Kristy H.}Staten Island, NY}383}5}4}-1}5}9/29/2016}THE FRESHEST UNI EVER. Ate here for dinner, it was pretty good. The wait was about 30 minutes but it was definitely worth it. Price is affordable but it did take a super long time with our entree dish. Portions are a bit small so make sure you order a few extra appetizers.
Stephanie C.}New York, NY}8}26}23}-1}4}9/28/2016}Definitely come here for their lunch special combos. $19 for a small soba or udon + rice bowl of your choice. I ordered the salmon and roe rice bowl (both were fresh). Size of the rice bowl is pretty decent; definitely bigger than I was expecting. Friend got a unadon (eel rice bowl) and it was huge. Soba noodles were slightly chewy how I like it. Portion of it may be small for some, but I thought it was satisfying enough with the rice bowl.Highly recommend the eel tempura - really tender meat and flavorful. Batter is nice and light and crispy. Sweet potato was yummy; seabass was okay (really meaty, but flavor-wise wasn't my favorite).
Anu K.}Manhattan, NY}268}191}389}18}3}9/27/2016}Came for lunch and decided to take advantage of one of their lunch sets. They have 2 to choose from. 1 which is basically the udon noodles with one of their rice bowls along with a few sides, and the other with udon noodles, shrimp tempura, salmon, and other sides which is a better deal.  We chose the first of the two with the grilled chicken/egg rice bowl - which was a mistake.  The udon noodles were great, however the rice bowl was bland, and the chicken was all dark meat (not a fan).  GET the second lunch set!
Kunnie H.}New York, NY}343}40}161}-1}5}9/24/2016}it's one of must go place in St MarkTransitional Japanese Soba restaurant.Price is average.Not cute as cocoron but food were really delicious!!They have special combo for weekday :)
David L.}New York, NY}80}72}43}-1}5}9/24/2016}Definitely one of the best restaurants in all of lower Manhattan. The soba was delightfully light and went really well with the broth~~  The hostess was quick and the waitress was super helpful. Would come again
Ernie K.}Dallas, TX}267}487}66}-1}2}9/23/2016Updatedreview}Used to think this place was awesome but after having traveled to Japan so many times, I realized that they are not that great when it comes to both cold and especially hot soba.  And compared to another soba place in midtown east that's a lot cheaper and more authentic, I must regretfully lower my rating from 5 stars to 2 stars.Won't be coming here again
Tom F.}New York, NY}4}322}64}18}3}9/22/2016}It's a lovely atmosphere, but it's quite expensive. I didn't find the soba to be really exceptional; I'd rather go to a cheaper place and get the same quality food, with perhaps even more flavor.
Victoria M.}New York, NY}2}88}74}-1}4}9/20/2016}Had a lunch special last week. Great unagi rice and nice snacks. A friend had a tempura rice which looks delish as well; another had a salmon rice and that tastes great. The price is a liiiiittle bit high tho, spent 25 dollars per person on lunch.
Missy S.}New York, NY}546}221}143}18}2}9/20/2016}Started with the tuna tartar and it really disappointed. So much so, that we didn't even finish it. The fish didn't taste particularly fresh, and when you pulled a piece of fish off the tower with your chopsticks, this strange saliva-like-pseudo-slime visibly appeared between the fish on my chopsticks and the tower, kind of like those old rom-coms where there is a little saliva that's between two people after they have a strange kiss. It was actually kind of gross. The avocado in there didn't taste fresh either and whatever other ingredients they used didn't make it any better. For my main, I had the spicy salmon rice bowl. It was decent, but the salmon had a smoky flavor to it that I didn't care for. My date had the hot soba duck bowl (a soup) that was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The ambiance was nice, but they delivered our mains prematurely and even though there was half the tuna tower left over at the end of the meal, no one asked if the tuna was alright. I could have sent it back, but didn't want my date to think I was rude. I may have missed the boat on this place but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back to see. Also, for this price range, I expect more.
Jacklyn C.}Brooklyn, NY}25}18}38}-1}4}9/19/2016}Had a craving for uni soba and decided to eat at Soba-Ya after discovering that Soba Totto is not opened for lunch on Sundays. No wait for a two-top at 1pm. Score! Uni soba was on point. At $27.75 for the large portion ($25 for regular), it costs more than that at Soba Totto (only $21!), but it hit the spot, so no real complaints. I realized I'm just writing reviews for uni. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Peng L.}Brooklyn, NY}137}333}1136}18}3}9/18/2016}Service was top notch. Portions are very small. Tuna was fresh and the best part was my side of uni with my cold soba noodles. The milk tofu at the end completed the meal. Flavors were natural to taste. 2 people, $91 with two appetizers, two noodle entree, and one dessert.
Brigitte U.}New York, NY}8}11}0}-1}5}9/14/2016}This is also one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Have been coming for over 4 years and every time is superb. Each dish is meticulously put together with such care and time. Their soba noodles are made in house and fresh. Their lunch and dinner specials are to die for. I love to get their salmon sashimi dish over rice. It is one of the best Chirashi type bowls I have had in New York. The bartenders are all great characters and friendly. All the wait staff is great!
Angela H.}Vaughan, Canada}2}19}13}-1}5}9/12/2016}We always come here whenever we visit New York City and were never disappointed. Came here again last week. It's always very busy, so we got there right before it opened. Once we sat down, the restaurant is already full. We ordered appetizers from their daily special menu. Daily specials are always the best! We then had the Kamo Seiro (hot duck soba), Uni soba and Salmon Tartar Don, all of which are oh so good!Desserts were totally amazing. The wasabi ice cream and tofu pudding may looked humble, but the taste absolutely blew us away. Must try if you come across them while you're here. Service was impeccable as always. Friendly and pay attention to all details. No wonder there's always a line up here.
Daisy C.}New York, NY}31}130}317}18}5}9/11/2016}Came here on sunday at opening to insure we get seats to try their lunch box set that they only make 25 a day. I would definitely recommend trying their lunch box set at least once. It is worth the price! The presentation of the food was very pretty. They look like small portion but it really fills you up. I like the soba better than the udon. I wish I had a 2nd stomach to try all the other food on the menu!
Annie C.}New York, NY}73}81}56}-1}5}9/11/2016}I really like it here. Service was great. Ordered the lunch set on a Sunday. They only make 25 of these daily. They come with a salmon bento box, tempura, soba, and tofu custard dessert. Delicious! $21 for the set. We say down immediately at 12:09.
Angie Y.}Brooklyn, NY}141}28}19}-1}3}9/11/2016}I had this place bookmarked for a while now. Finally I had a chance to try this place with my boyfriend and two other people. The place isn't huge inside and décor is nice. We waited about half an hour for a table. We shared the tatsuta age which is a home style fried marinated chicken. It wasn't what we expected. We expected it to be "marinated" with more flavor. It tasted plain but at least it was juicy inside. We all got a bowl of soba. I had the kamo nanban which is duck soba with green onions. It was just okay. I thought the soba noodles were a bit soggy. The broth was very light in taste. For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee. It looks like a creme brulee but it didn't taste like one. When I broke through the caramelized sugar to get to the inside, the custard inside was very soft and watery. This is not what a creme brulee should be like. It is possible that maybe it was an off day. My boyfriend had the mango pudding. He thought his dessert was okay. Everyone thought their dessert should have been creamer. My favorite soba place is still Cocoron. Their broth is just full of flavor. The soba noodles aren't soggy. Their soba never disappoint.I was disappointed with Soba ya because there were so many good reviews. I like that their broth is light in taste but their dessert just wasn't what we expected. If you come here, I say try their soba but pass on dessert. My boyfriend and I had a stomach ache after dinner. We think it might be the dessert.Overall, not a bad soba place. It could be an off day for the chef. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Also, it is a little pricer than other places I've been to.
Pitila W.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}9/10/2016}Delicious cold soba noodles. Duck was a little bit rich and slightly overpriced. The shrimp tempura was excellent....kid friendly too :)
Lina S.}Houston, TX}0}4}2}-1}1}9/5/2016}The female usher is extremely rude and unrespectful. will not return here.
Sohee C.}New York, NY}7}52}76}-1}5}9/1/2016}Fresh and simple, great place to take your Asian parents who complain that American food can be too salty, too sweet, too everything. I'm not trying to talk about any specific parents ... *coughs in my parents' general direction* but putting that aside, it was the first time my parents actually enjoyed US food and not a single complaint was heard.As a family from Seoul, we love Japanese food that is a bit more simple and traditional, and Soba-ya was a hit for all of us. Luckily I came at a time when the wait wasn't too long and we weren't too hungry--it was a bit rainy at the time so we didn't mind just sitting. I have noticed that the wait can be a bit long in general, unless you come at a really odd time. The first time I was here, it was about 9pm on a weekday, and for one person, there was no wait.What I've gotten:- yamakake soba (my favorite!) ... so fresh and if you like the slimy but slightly crunchy texture of yamakake (grated Japanese mountain yam) with tuna sashimi, I would say GO FOR THIS ONE.- duck soba (my friend has gotten this one and she loves it so much. I believe my dad got this one too, and he was very happy)- matcha creme brulee - I got this with a friend and it was a solid choice. We could crack the hard sugar top and delve into a warm, creamy inside.. if you like creme brulee and want to add some earthiness, get it.
Kim Y.}New York, NY}303}88}680}18}4}8/30/2016}Best Lunch Special in NYC!Where can you get a lunch set for $20 in NYC that includes a rice bowl and noodles!Ordered the TUNA STEAK DON with Cold Soba Noodles and UNAJU (Eel Rice)Searred tuna was okay, the rice had too much soy sauce. The best part of the whole meal was the perfectly cooked soba noodles! Eel rice was a little bit too salty, but the rice was amazing! That soft fluffy Japanese rice paired with eel and teriyaki sauce! The correct way to eat cold soba noodles is to hold the cup of dipping sauce and pick up some soba noodles. Dip it into the cup of chilled dipping sauce (usually a mixture of soup stock, mirin, and water) and slurp quickly. After you finished all your soba noodles, the waiter will bring over the water the soba noodles were cooked and you pour the water into the dipping sauce. Then, you drink the cup of soup/dipping sauce!MUST TRY SOBA NOODLES!
Rebecca H.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}8/29/2016Updatedreview}We have been customers of Sobaya since 2005 but never saw an incapable/rude receptionist/front desk waitress like the current one. She has no idea about high chairs and doesn't want us to sit in for the reason of fire hazard? Can my kid cause fire hazard? That is really an insult!!!! Then they allowed other parents with twins to sit in. Felt discriminated.
S K.}Fairfax, VA}70}33}11}-1}3}8/25/2016}It's good, but not sure how it's getting awesome reviews. Their noodles are indeed good. I think the soba sauce can be a bit sweeter; it's just what I'm used to. Their tuna tare tare was SO FISHY. I wouldn't get it ever again even if it was just a bad batch when I went. Service is great and that's probably why I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. The best thing on the menu is their soft silken tofu. The one we got had little baby mushrooms on one and ginger on the other.
Nancy N.}New York, NY}314}132}319}18}5}8/24/2016}I vaguely remember coming here during my NYU years a couple times. All good experiences. Came again here for lunch and the soba is still as amazing as five years ago. The service is a little rush. They tend to move you through the dinning process but that did not offend me. Both my friend and I ordered the limited quantity lunch box and it was a good amount of food. We got shrimp and veggie tempura (3 pieces), cold soba with dipping sauce, salmon, veggies, pickles, tofu salad and a little block of rice chirashi. Every component executed with care. Over the amount is great but the flavors are light so it is not a heavy meal. The cold soba was so refreshing. I would recommend tasting the noodle before dipping sauce to get the authentic buckwheat flavor. Then put as many scallions as you like into the dipping sauce, take a bit of wasabi with the tip of your chopstick and then lift the noodles into the sauce. Don't be afraid to slurp the noodles. That is the best way to enjoy the soba! The lunchbox option also comes with a tiny milk tofu dessert at the end. The strawberries on the dessert did left an interesting aftertaste in my mouth but over all good ending to my meal.
Xi C.}New York, NY}0}18}17}-1}4}8/22/2016}Was here this weekend with two of my friends. We ordered the Uni soba, shrimp tempera soba and sake don. All of us enjoyed our food. Definitely recommend !
Tanya Z.}New York, NY}369}334}600}18}5}8/22/2016}Ooo yummy. Soba is super good for the summer if you want a refreshing cold noodle to cool you down! I got the mini lunch box (which is a pretty good size!) they have some good choices for it. I got the salmon with roe rice and the soba noodles. They have small side dishes it comes with. There was a bit of a line around lunch time but not too bad for a party of 2. I would come back here and try the uni soba that everyone was getting!!
Alex Y.}Fort Lee, NJ}598}459}2254}18}4}8/22/2016}What's so special about a bowl of noodle, you may ask?With the vast selection of Japanese restaurants around the area, Soba-ya has really set itself apart by focusing on a very common dish and turning it into something special.They have at least 15~20 types of different soba/udon choices on the menu, not to mention the additional toppings (ex. uni, ikura, etc.) that you can add on to the bowl.  I personally prefer the cold ones, especially during the summer.  It's incredibly refreshing and light.Despite the fact that many other places in the area also have soba offerings on their menus, it's the quality and freshness that shines here at Soba-ya.  Ingredients like fresh uni and tuna really complement the soba well, and their house tempura batter are also extremely light.  Nothing is heavy or greasy here.If you want to venture away from the namesake dish, their also have various lunch/dinner box set options available.  These are equally good as well.Just thinking about their cold soba with shrimp tempura is making me hungry again...
Melissa H.}Flushing, NY}81}5}1}-1}4}8/17/2016}Came here with a group of 6 people on a Tuesday night at around 745. There was a wait of about 45 minutes but they take your number down and call you so you can walk around the area instead of waiting by the restaurant. Once we were seated the place was not too loud so was able to talk with our friends comfortably. They had a fairly large sized menu of appetizers, hot soba/udon, cold soba, and rice bowls. My boyfriend and I ordered the regular sized salmon oyako don and a small curry nanban to share. I like that they offer sizes for their dishes since I tend to get full very easily so that was a plus. We both enjoyed both dishes, the salmon tasted fresh and the rice was like sushi rice and not just plain white rice which was nice. There was also a good amount of salmon for us to share which was a plus. The hot curry nanban with soba was tasty as well. Great portion size for a small, was enough to share. Sometimes I dislike curry, but this one was just how I like it. Service was alright but had to keep on asking for water since they never came back to refill our glasses. A little bit pricey but would probably come back again to try other dishes because it really did satisfy our cravings and was delicious!!
Eric M.}Columbia, MD}4}23}554}-1}3}8/16/2016}I went during lunch time with 5 people. We ordered from the lunch menu- both from the mini-lunch and the combo-lunch menu. The food was good- I personally like the dish with the eel. The customer service was okay. The desserts were visually appealing and it was delicious. It was a little overprice.I might go back to try something from the dinner menu next time!
Julia L.}New York, NY}136}23}0}-1}4}8/13/2016}Excellent soba and excellent deserts. The Soba was light yet al dente and subtly flavorful. The tea was also solid, not too rich but also not super watered down.Decor was tasteful and quiet, also not much of a line. Overall a good place for a meal.It's a little on the pricy side, but totally worth it.
Ariana K.}New York, NY}412}99}157}18}1}8/8/2016}This was my first time having soba at a restaurant and definitely wasn't a good experience. Had the tempura hot soba regular size. Wasn't a fan of the hot soba. The broth was sour and the noodles were a bit soggy. The tempura was crispy but too oily and bland. Dipping in the broth made it also taste sour so that didn't quite help either. The oil used for the tempura didn't see that great either. Went home and got sick from the food. Won't be coming back to this place.
Jen L.}Manhattan, NY}284}115}366}18}4}8/6/2016}A little more expensive than my usual lunch, but the quality of the food is worth it. I got the grilled eel mini don with hot soba ($19). The eel was a perfect balance of sweet and salty. The soba was the best I've had in nyc, with a faint but fragrant tea flavor. The noodles are freshly made with precision, sometimes in front of the waiting area by the door.
Lauren H.}New York, NY}318}153}838}-1}5}8/4/2016}Solid & affordable.Restaurant itself looks like a little Japanese dojo sitting inconspicuously within NYC's East Village. Very enticing and cute if you ever have the chance of walking by.I had the wonderful and crazy opportunity of coming here TWICE in one day. Specifically within six hours of my day... Oops. Regardless, this was probably.. 100% the best choice I've ever made in my food travels, ever.-- LUNCH 3pm --Late lunch right? Soba ya is open until 3:30pm for lunch (note that!) and their deals are unbeatable. Took ma boo thang S. Lee out for an inpromptu meal. Here's the scoop:Uni Tororo: sea urchin with some not-for-the-faint-of-taste-buds grated yam. BUT if you love uni as much a muah, you'll quickly get over the wierd gooey texture cause their uni is BOMB. "Best uni I've ever had" - S. Lee (remember this people!)Sake Oyako Don: salmon chirashi with salmon roe. You get a small - yet sizeable - bowl, with your choice of a small - yet sizeable - hot or cold soba noodles. Side accrutrimonts include Japanese potatoes, pickles, and an odd jelly thing. Sauces are also included for dunking those amazing (cold) soba noodles in [$19]Tuna-Steak Don: see above description except it's  a seared tuna chirashi bowl. [$18.50]Green Tea Bruleé: creamy goodness with a powerful punch of green tea, worth the order! [$7.50]Aaand, it didn't stop there. Cue drum roll....-- DINNER 9:45pm --This time I came with my gal pal, LOFT colleague, ZT. Even sat at the same table as I did lunch, what are the odds?!The meal was, no doubt, amazing.I ordered the Tempura (hot) Soba, and Zo ordered the Sake Oyako Don.The bill was (naturally) almost the same price as lunch but instead got two dishes instead of four. Lesson of the day? Go to Soba-ya during LUNCH!Great place nontheless, one of NYC's greatest in my book.
Jesse L.}Brooklyn, NY}6}58}21}-1}4}8/2/2016}Had the lunch set I believe that had salmon sashimi, salmon roe, sushi rice & cold soba.  It was on the pricier side, a little more than $20 for the small portions but that's really to be expected with Japanese places.  Food was good, wish portions were bigger, they were kinda stingy with the soba.
Pech T.}New York, NY}0}4}5}-1}5}8/1/2016}Im not a big fan of ramen. I change my mind since i try tempura ramen here. And the green tea creme brulee is so damm good. Not too sweet, still has a flavor of real green tea:)
TseYi T.}New York, NY}51}10}2}-1}1}8/1/2016}Ordered uni jelly dish. Some of the uni were rotten. Extremely bitter and weird colored. I spit it out right away and asked the waiter. Waiter came back to me with a new uni jelly but told me the uni wasn't rotten it was just from an older box. I mean...if you made a mistake by serving rotten uni, please admit it.
Abigail K.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}20}116}197}-1}4}7/31/2016}Soba-ya was very good. I tend to be more of a sushi or izakaya person then a soba/ramen lover, but the food was very solid. Excellent atmosphere, very good service. I recommend going with a group and ordering a plethora of appetizers - the small dishes were all phenomenal. The pork belly especially stood out. Went with the cold soba (since it was in the 90's outside and getting hot food seemed absurd) and enjoyed it. Several of our party got the sea urchin, which was a big hit.
Joyce K.}Jersey City, NJ}0}13}12}-1}5}7/27/2016}Went there for lunch on a Sunday and waited 15 minutes for a table for two. Ordered the uni soba and LOVED it! They gave lots of uni which were very fresh and buttery. My initial doubts of the uni and mountain grated yam combination were gone as it proved to mix really well somehow. Both gave the entree a buttery and smooth taste which I'd definitely come back for.
Cindy G.}New York, NY}829}399}423}-1}5}7/26/2016}WOW I am actually mind blown by how delicious and satisfying this dinner was. With all the ramen spots in the city, it's rare for me to steer away to get soba. However, if you are in the mood for something refreshing (because it's 90 degrees outside), yet savory and also healthy, then Sobaya is an awesome choice!The noodles menu is split into two sides: hot and cold noodles. You can choose from one of the two styles of noodles: udon or soba. Each order of noodles comes with some type of protein (sashimi, tempura, tofu, etc.), and the hot noodles also come with a sizzling broth! Finally, you can choose the size (small, regular, large) depending on your appetite for the meal. I ended up ordering the regular cold soba noodles with uni ($25)! It was the perfect meal for a hot summer day. Not only was there a generous portion of uni, but combined with the noodles that were mixed in a special dipping sauce, the flavors were so satisfying. The best part was, after I finished slurping all my noodles, the waitress brought over a warm broth to mix with the leftover sauce in my bowl. This ensured no bits of uni went to waste and created a whole new round of eating.Friendly service, delicious food, and affordable prices mean I will definitely be coming back!
Xiu L.}Corona, NY}11}57}454}-1}3}7/25/2016}Was very hyped for this place due to other yelp reviews and great rating. Came here and ordered some veggie soba (around $15 for small) and was quite disappointed. The soup was a bit too salty and the noodles were alright.
Vera L.}San Francisco, CA}261}207}326}18}4}7/22/2016}I found SobaYa on YELP when I was trying to find a good spot that would fill us up but was clean tasting and relatively healthy.  Of course, my go-to comfort food is Japanese food.  It's not even Chinese which I can find relatively greasy or heavy at times.  Soba was just the perfect food for us.  The place isn't the biggest, but none of the places around St. Marks is huge in size.  One of the things that I really wanted to get was their Soba-ya Bento Box.  They only have a limited amount per day so it's best to go when they open.  My mom however wanted a mini-bento box because she felt that the special bento was too large.Mini Bento Box: probably the perfect size truthfully.  I may get this in the future from here on out.  They serve it with a little piece of tamago and oshinki (Japanese pickles) along with a small rice bowl which you can choose from a select list.  You also have a choice of hot or cold soba.  Both my mum and I chose hot soba today because we got food poisoning from a Filipino restaurant the night before, blog entry to be added.PROS-great quantity for one person who is between a light and moderate eater-good variety of food in the bento-nice balanced flavor: the soba soup was not too salty surprisingly and very hearty-the salmon bowl came with a little sauce on the bottom that wasn't soy sauce, but it was so addicting.  I normally prefer noodle over rice, but I couldn't help but scoop quite a bit of that rice bowl.CONS-I would have preferred the salmon to be complete sashimi and not seared on the outside.  However, this isn't really a con as it is a preference.Special Soba-Ya Bento Box:  This came with quite a few more things including tempura, a side salad, seared salmon, special onigiri (rice ball/cake), vermicelli in tsuyu dipping sauce, and then boiled vegetables.  They really embodied the Japanese form of cooking called Washoku.   I didn't take a picture of the hot soba, but it's exactly the same as the one with the Mini Bento above.PROS-great quantity, definitely enough for two people to share if they are light eaters.-good flavors: same broth that is used in the mini bento box-fresher since there was the salad and the vermicelli-the vermicelli was a really nice cold noodle side dish to have in addition with the hot soba-the salmon was done perfectly: not over cooked but with seared crispy skin.  It wasn't overseasoned either.CONS- the onigiri or sushi rice cake could have a little more flavor.  It was tasty and the rice was perfectly done but for some reason it didn't have that much flavor.I definitely will come back, especially during my first winter in New York.  I can't wait to sit down with a hot bowl of soba and slurp to my satisfaction.
Monica B.}Brookline, MA}0}11}3}-1}4}7/19/2016}I had high expectations for Soba-ya since my friends have been raving about it. Their soba/udon comes in small, regular or large sizes that you can choose from. I ordered the regular uni soba, and it was the perfect amount. However, I thought that the soba sauce lacked a bit of flavor. The texture of the noodles were perfect though. At the front of the restaurant, where one would wait to be seated, you can watch a chef making the noodles (pretty interesting touch to the restaurant).
Sarah T.}Hong Kong}178}472}2589}18}4}7/18/2016}Very authentic and delicious soba. The price is a bit steep for the food that we got though :( the line might be a bit long but they text you when your table is ready.
Grace N.}New York, NY}18}180}734}18}4}7/18/2016}ordered Uni soba with mashed yam.By the time I arrived the restaurant, it was alMost 85 degree.A very good day to have soba.Uni was excellent and fresh.The soba was good, but not excellent.(may be I was expected a little thickier)Yam paste was new to me.The complete eating experience was good.The tempura at next table looked quite oily, n thick battered.I will wait till cooler n try the soup base soba.Totally worth it, the 26 bucks for Uni Soba.But it is not my fav soba place, may be second :p
Art C.}New York, NY}156}920}43}18}3}7/16/2016}Not bad... Restaurant is on the small side as you can imagine. Nice and light and bright on the inside with pretty good service. We had the katsu and assorted tempura to start. Not bad... Then we had the Curry Nanban and Kamo Nanban. Not bad...I can't see us returning but it's certainly not a bad option if you're in the mood for Soba.
Gabrielle P.}Queens, NY}260}223}1660}18}4}7/8/2016}Just wow. I was taken aback by my first authentic Japanese dining experience that doesn't involve sushi! The only soba noodles that I've ever tried are the pre-packaged ones sold at Asian supermarkets. After trying Soba-ya's soba noodles, I don't think I can really go back. The soba noodles here are 100% handmade and were surprisingly not bland as I had feared. It has good texture: wasn't too soggy or overcooked. It's so simple, yet so healthful. I like how the menu allows you to choose different portion sizes, just in case you can't really eat that much. I also tried the Chicken Tatsuta Age(marinated deep-fried chicken). Chicken was fried with fresh oil and was not greasy at all. One plate of this, despite the small portion size, was already enough to make me feel full.The food here is a little on the pricey side, but quality-wise, it's very well worth the money.
Priscilla C.}Sacramento, CA}169}302}1553}18}4}7/8/2016}This place was pretty awesome. Decided to give the lunch menu a try based on Yelp pics and reviews. No regrets! Ordered a mini lunch set with Una-ju (eel over rice). Comes with a choice of hot/cold udon or soba with some little side dishes. They have many other great options besides Una-ju (will post picture of menu options). I ordered a bento lunch box (they only make 25 of these so first come first serve), which came with salad, choice of hot/cold soba or udon, mini chirasi rice, shrimp x 2/pepper tempura, piece of broiled salmon, veggie of the day and it came with the berry tofu dessert which was absolutely delicious and soft! The soba was great, the tempura was fresh. Everything was pretty good. I think for the price, you get a lot for a lunch special. Both meals cost about $40 plus tax. Only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star was because it isnt the best Jap food I have ever eaten. The other cool thing was their toilets in the bathroom! They reminded me of Japan with the bidet styles. Will post pictures. Yes, I took a picture of it for my fellow Yelpers lol.
Sattie T.}Sunnyside, Queens, NY}56}10}39}-1}5}7/6/2016}Appreciate this authentic soba (buckwheat noodle) place in St. Marks area. You can try all diffferent kinds of soba / udon, hot or cold. Tempura is good option to add too. It gets crowded around lunch/dinner time. Wanna try Early bird deals next time!
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}7/3/2016}I LOVE Sobaya! The essence of many things are simplicity, dedication, and perfection. So are they the reason for sobaya's success.Various kinds of soup, toppings and flavors to pair with soba/ramen. The soba is smooth, flavorful and original. I always get the hot soba because I love the soy sauce broth. If you get code soba, you will eat by dipping it into sauce or adding soy sauce on top the soba. After that, they will pour soba soup into the bowl so you can drink the soup with the remaining sauce (this way is very similar to the Chinese way of eating dry noodles/dumplings! We drink the noodle/dumpling soup after the meal as well. In old saying that the soup cooked with the food helps us to digest the food itself.) Desserts are highlights too! Very delicate and not too sweet. Sobaya is also a great spot for vegetarian - great vegetarian soba selection and appetizers. Worth every penny and every visit.
Shirley W.}Brooklyn, NY}160}108}1235}18}4}7/3/2016}Came on a rainy day and walked past the restaurant and went next door to another japanese place instead. Very easily missed because most of the signs are in japanese lettering. My boyfriend and I were seated at the bar in front of a very friendly and informative bartender/waitress. She described every dish to us and how to eat it. They kindly placed each dish carefully in a set up in front of us. When the food arrived it brought back memories of when i was in Japan. Everything was very presentable and carefully placed a certain way. Now here's what i thought about the food:-Uni jelly: sea urchin on top of yuzu jelly and wasabi was surprisingly not what i expected. The looks of it was nice but boy the taste was very fishy and the wasabi was overpowering. I felt like I was eating bitter fish oil. Usually I'm a fan of uni but this appetizer did not make me want to take another spoon of.-Assorted sashimi: freshest assorted sashimi I've tasted around east village. Slices of fish layered on top of shiso leaves which added more flavor to the fish. What stood out to me is they ground their wasabi fresh just like how Japan does it.-Uni soba: addictive bowl of uni and mountain yam on top of cold soba noodles. I've never eaten that much uni in one sitting. Other restaurants aren't as generous as they were. It was a refreshing dish to slurp on a ideally hot summer day even though it wasn't at that moment.-Hot chicken curry udon: thick broth of chicken curry over udon. my boyfriend ordered this dish and he said he much prefer this broth over Cocoron's japanese style warm curry soba. On the other hand, i enjoyed theirs more because the soup base had grounded meat. As for Soba-ya's curry udon it was plain.
daniel l.}Coquitlam, Canada}91}6}0}-1}4}7/3/2016}Service is good and the restaurant is clean. Food tastes ok but for the price it's definitely not enough food for a grown man.I ended up going to a taco place next door after.
Jessica T.}Manhattan, NY}7}23}22}-1}3}6/30/2016}Food - MediocreService - ExcellentAs soon as you walk in, everyone greets you and it suddenly feels like you just took a step into Japan. A quick look and you see the beautiful wooden furniture, savory aromas, and the colorful kimonos all the servers wear. But that basically ends the illusion. Ordered the kitsune (aged tofu) with soba noodles. The broth tasted really salty and earthy, almost herbal-like. Nothing impressive or outstanding. Would give it a 2/5.  My friend ordered the curry seiro dip soba noodle, which was basically fried chicken with green onions in curry sauce. The curry wasn't thick like most, really runny and topped with an unappetizing layer of oil. Also 2/5.Extra star for the super friendly service. Food is salty, not very flavorful, unimpressiveBut service is top notch.
Kevin W.}Manhattan, NY}224}42}0}-1}5}6/30/2016}My favorite soba location in the city. A wonderful place to bring clients, friends and family. The dishes are healthy, vibrant, light, and palate pleasing.Tons of vegetarian options (mushroom soba spectacular and a must.The best service I have ever received at a restaurant!
Stephanie C.}Manhattan, NY}301}289}25}-1}4}6/27/2016}4.2 stars for this place. I ordered 16 items. This is the order I like them. + sea urchin with yuzu jelly and wasabi - refreshing dish I loved this!+ fried fish skin with guacomole + marinated duck+ green tea creme brulee+ white fish avocado ceviche+ assorted tempura platter was nicely fried+ soba noodles - freshly made but the sauce needs toppings+ assorted sashimi platter - very fresh + milk pudding - I poured out some of the fermented sauce and it tasted a lot better+ gobo vegetables was a nice palate cleanser+ green tea ice cream with red bean bun - the green tea was really bitter and I really liked it however it was a little icy+ itasawa fish cake was okay+ amitsu black sesame ice cream with jelly and red bean was lackluster though it looked pretty+ gindara yaki was a little salty for black cod+ udon is actually not freshly made there and there was nothing special about it+ tomago - this was my least favorite and I did not finish this dish
Austin K.}New York, NY}231}30}32}-1}5}6/25/2016}Such a great idea for a restaurant, as a nice break from ramen. I got the uni soba while the other two got the cold duck soba. For most of the soba, you can either get it hot or cold, and get three options for the amount of noodles - 100 grams, 150 grams, and 200 grams. I ordered the 150 grams because I was unsure how much that correlated to, but I really should have ordered the 200 grams. It's really not that much, so if you come here hungry, definitely opt for the 200 grams, which is just a few dollars more.The uni was great, surprisingly fresh and definitely the highlight of the meal. It comes with the grated mountain yam, which gave the noodles a very slimy texture. I don't normally prefer that, but for this, it felt fine - just a warning though, since it threw me off.The duck was also good, and they give you a pretty decent portion of the duck meat for the meal. Towards the end of the meal, the waiter will give you more broth to finish off the soba. The broth is pretty flavorless, and I think it's the same one that they give you for plain soba. I was going to get the happy hour set (only comes with plain soba), but since it was my first time here, I wanted something with flavor - very glad I chose the uni. Maybe next time I come though, I'll try to convince my friend to get the set so I can try the tempura hehe.
Janice T.}New York, NY}64}77}64}-1}4}6/22/2016Updatedreview}Came here for lunch and got the eel rice bowl set. Everything was delicious! Also got the edamame, seaweed salad, shrimp tempura as appetizers. Portions were large enough for me to have leftovers to take home.
Eileen R.}Queens, NY}123}71}127}18}5}6/15/2016}This place is super cute and has a traditional Japanese feel to it. I went here with my friends to eat lunch and I absolutely love the oyako don with hot soba that I ordered. The servers are very patient with us since it was our first time here and my friend took a while to decide what he wants.  Also, he was nice enough to show us the proper way to eat the soba. I'm definitely coming back here.
Irene Y.}New York, NY}249}71}752}-1}5}6/11/2016}Located a block away from the crowded main street of Saint Mark's, there are hidden gems that may be hard to miss if you're not specifically looking, especially Soba-ya. I have walked into another restaurant and clearly was not attentive of my surroundings at all.. This restaurant is not big, but not super tiny as well, it may feel like you're sitting on top of each other if your party is super big. But I am not complaining since my party was just two people. The two dishes I have tried were: -Sake Oyako Don( Sliced Salmon Sashimi And Salmon Roe Over Rice)-Kamo Seiro  Saute'ed Duck Slice & Tokyo Negi (Japanese Green Onion) in Hot Dipping SauceVery generous portions for the price. It was an effortlessly made meal that is very refreshing to eat after eating a bunch of unhealthy food. - no complaints whatsoever.
Margie A.}Minneapolis, MN}79}93}881}18}4}6/11/2016}The handmade soba noodles & service was thoroughly enjoyable. The cold soba (the star of the meal) was exactly what I needed on this warm summer day. I got the bento box and it was more than enough food. The only thing I wish it had was some pickled ginger for that fresh bite. Luckily my friend got a different dish & I was able to steal some of hers. My group of 6 squeezed into a booth so we wouldn't have to wait but shortly after we down, the server asked if we wanted to move to a bigger table which was so much better. It was really thoughtful. They also let us split our bill 5 ways. Definely worth the price and the bonus is that it was the healthiest meal of my business trip. So glad a local took me here!
Celine L.}Los Angeles, CA}2989}901}4625}-1}5}6/10/2016}WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THIS IN LA!? All soba restaurant with different types of soba noodles to enjoy...  We were so lucky we got in right before they closed! We got the uni soba with tororo as well as a chirashi soba to share. The uni soba with tororo comes with a side of dipping sauce (soy based) and after mixing everything, you get this amazing mixture of soba noodles! The tororo makes the overall dish slimy which I enjoyed as it was different from what I usually eat. The uni was SO fresh and they were very generous with their portions!The chirashi soba comes in a hot soup with tempura, Japanese omelette, shiitake mushroom, fried bean curd, and fish cake. The soup was flavorful and light, and was very tasty. The toppings were delicious, and the soba noodles tasted so different from the uni one for some reason. So good!! Both dishes used the same soba noodles, but tasted so different with various toppings and flavors! I seriously fell in love with this place... I need to come back!
Kimberly Q.}San Francisco, CA}479}25}0}-1}5}6/8/2016}This place already has enough reviews, but I'm gonna review anyways because THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS.  I've gone here for lunch several times and have ordered the lunch box combo. The sake don is super fresh and the rice with it has the perfect stickiness and flavor.  I usually order the hot soba which is divine, especially on a cold day.  Tempura is always on point.This is seriously one of my top go-tos for Japanese food in the city.
Lazaro S.}Scottsdale, AZ}0}5}3}-1}3}6/3/2016}Expensive for eating only Soba and unfortenly the menu dont have sushi food and nigiris
Annie C.}Brooklyn, NY}367}123}535}-1}4}6/2/2016}Soba-ya is one of the better Japanese soba houses in the city. Quite contrary to Cocoron's well known variety of flavorful soba broths, this place takes more of a traditional approach to soba. You have the option of enjoying the noodles in a traditional hot broth or cold broth for dipping served along with condiments (wasabi & scallion). The soba noodles taste earthy and subtle along with a great firm texture. When dipped, there's an optimal balance between the buckwheat and savory soy-sauce. So simple, yet so tasty. LUNCH BOX SET ($21) -- 25 servings per day only. This lunch set consists of a salad, assorted veggies, sweet omelet w/ salmon roe chirashi, shrimp tempura, and your choice of soba or udon (hot or cold). The shrimp tempura had the perfect light and crisp coating without being overly greasy. As for the chirashi, the sticky white rice tasted delicious and complemented well with the salmon roe & sweet omelet. The highlight of the meal was indeed the soba which I enjoyed to a high extent. Be sure to drink the rest of the sauce by diluting it with soba-yu that the staff will provide. Soba-yu is essentially the hot water where the soba noodles were boiled. To complete the meal, milk tofu is served along with hot tea to freshen up your palate. UNI COLD SOBA ($24) -- Often an acquired taste. However, if you're a self-proclaimed uni lover, then you'll enjoy this dish. The sea urchin & grated mountain yam is bedded atop cold soba. Buttery. Briny. Fantastic. GREEN TEA BRULEE ($3.50) -- I love matcha-flavored desserts. This was super creamy and light with a perfect crunchy caramelized top. AMMITSU ($3.50) -- They had me at black sesame. This dessert consisted of red bean paste and ice-cream of your choice (green tea or black sesame) layered on top of sweet agar and brown sugar syrup. The delicious nutty black sesame ice-cream created a synergistic combination with the red bean paste. I would've enjoyed this more though if they had provided a better agar to ice-cream ratio. For the most part, I had a great soba eating experience here each time and never left disappointed. Soba-ya definitely earns the title of being on the 2016 Michelin Bib Gourmand list. If you're looking for top-notch quality soba, look no further!
Leo A.}New York, NY}28}3}0}-1}4}5/28/2016}Comfortable place and big. I got seat right away.   The server was so nice and friendly. I took my time study the menu. What i like here is duck soba, the noodle is well cook and the duck is perfect not too much fat. I love it so much. Definitely will be back.
Jessica D.}Brooklyn, NY}527}851}2165}18}3}5/23/2016}Small restaurant, but decent food and service was on point. I came here with my girl friend for dinner on a Friday night at 6PM. Tables filled up quick and I guess it was because everyone wanted their fix of warm delicious soba noodles since it was cold outside (this happened in January). The restaurant was extremely clean.I tried the Cold Soba Tea which is roasted buckwheat tea. I liked the tea very much and it did indeed taste roasty. The tea wasn't very strong in taste which I liked.My girl friend didn't want soba noodles because she found out the broth is made with fish and apparently she doesn't eat fish/seafood, so she got the Oyako Don instead which is an egg with a poached chicken over rice. I ordered the Kitsune Noodle which was soba noodle soup with fried bean curd. The noodles are quite expensive compared to Cocoron and I wasn't too impressed with the broth either. The broth could have used more flavor.All in all,it was nice to experience a different type of food with my friend since we both usually eat ramen or Filipino. I think I would much prefer Cocoron though because it's closer to commute to, cheaper, and the quality is a lot better.
Xin S.}Jersey City, NJ}58}15}319}-1}4}5/20/2016Updatedreview}This isn't my first time here, but it's the first time I knew Early bird dinner set. The famous soba is always fresh and service here is beyond good ;)We had seasonal appetizer Uni Jelly with Yuzi flavor and the early bird set. I was a little bit disappointed at the uni jelly. Maybe the flavors didn't combine smoothly. The early bird set was a surprise! It included 4 small pieces appetizers, tempera soba set and vanilla ice cream. All was flavorful except the strawberry on top of the ice cream.Strongly recommended!
Jocelyn H.}Oceanside, NY}109}15}1}-1}1}5/16/2016}Many restaurants in Manhattan brand themselves as authentic Japanese, only to sorely disappoint discerning customers. My friend and I ordered a curry chicken soba and a soba with vegetables. I can make this curry chicken soba with an instant Japanese gravy powder and chuck some boiled chicken pieces and soba in it. The consistency was grossly viscous and the meat bland. The vegetable soba was also not noteworthy at all. Now for the service. My waitress had a cold and sneezed into my hand towel before giving it to me and was constantly sniffling while bringing us food. And how did they get an A for health inspection?In summary, an absolute let down. I will never go here again.
Beth L.}Little Italy, Manhattan, NY}2}40}2}-1}5}5/15/2016}Wonderful place to have fresh soba noodle. We went there on Sunday afternoon for mothers day lunch. Wait wasn't as long that was a plus. We were a party of 6 ppl so glad they had a big table for us. The place is very small. Great service and great foods. We will go back in a heart beat. Love the lunch combo.
Sharon Y.}New York, NY}371}89}12}-1}5}5/13/2016}Fantastic Japanese noodle place in the East Village! This place gets super crowded during the colder seasons (who wouldn't want a yummy steaming bowl of noodle soup during a chilly evening?!), and wait times average 40 minutes. During warmer seasons, there's usually no wait or less than 10 minutes. I've come here on multiple occasions and my favorites are:Appetizer- Tatsuta Age: it's basically deep fried Japanese chicken... can't go wrong with that! Always super crispy and full of flavor.Entrees- Nabeyaki Udon: I'm a huge fan of Nabeyaki Udon and I think this place makes the best! The tempura is always fried perfectly, the broth is savory and a perfect complement to the noodles. There's also an egg and chicken in there. YUMMY.Salmon Oyako Don: very generous portions of freshly sliced salmon over rice. The salmon always tastes fresh and melts in your mouth.Desserts- Green Tea Bruleé: AMAZING. The hard caramel topping is torched perfectly and tastes perfect with the green tea custard underneath. Not super sweet and fulfilled my cravings!
Akhila K.}New York, NY}169}68}0}-1}4}5/13/2016}This was a delicious place for both lunch and dinner. The noodles are really the highlight here. I enjoyed the hot udon noodles at lunch and also dinner, but the lunch special doesn't really give you any vegetables in the noodles. They're just plain. For dinner, I was able to order the noodles with mushrooms which was delicious. The noodles are excellent and the broth is delicious by itself.   Feels healthy. Also, the portion sizes are substantial.The food I didn't enjoy was the rice + veg tempura. It was flavorless and was not a highlight. I would recommend sticking to noodles here.The atmosphere and decor is also very nice for a date or with friends. There's often a guy making noodles towards the front, which is fun to watch!
Un L.}NY, NY}22}64}43}-1}4}5/6/2016}I love this restaurant.  I don't love soba...but their soba is so fresh, I can eat it all day!  Everything on the menu is delish!  Only thing that makes me not give it 5 stars is... really pricey.  BUT it's worth it if you want to treat yourself to a good clean delicious japanese meal!  The staff is so friendly.  The restaurant vibe is good.  But it does get packed after 6:30!  Friend and I went for dinner on a wednesday at 6:30 to avoid the crowd....but as soon as we sat...it got packed!
Pam Z.}Chicago, IL}38}235}1}-1}5}5/5/2016Updatedreview}This is the best udon in New York. I've been back a million times since this review and realize I should have updated this to 5* long ago. So effing good!
Tiffany N.}Jackson Heights, NY}6}72}9}-1}5}5/2/2016}Hands down best soba noodle I Ever had! Had the fried bean curd with spinach AMAZING!
Hua M.}Woodside, NY}52}9}3}-1}3}4/30/2016}First time here. The food (cold soba, veg. tempura) is fine, but the price is unreasonably high. It isn't worth it. I'd rather spend that money at Udon West or other Japanese restaurant.
Lillian C.}New York, NY}682}71}167}-1}4}4/29/2016}Come here for lunch - there's a variety of $20 lunch sets and no wait time. Expect to wait around 10 minutes for your food though so don't expect it to be a super fast, casual lunch. Complimentary green tea as you wait!I ordered the mini salmon don with cold soba set. Soba comes with a traditional dipping sauce. The mini don comes with ~6 pieces of salmon. For some reason, I remember the portions to be bigger before. I was left pretty hungry after finishing my set (didn't finish all the sushi rice though). I wish they would give more salmon.My friend got the large soba with dipping sauce. It came in a double layer box, both containing soba noodles. The broth was pretty thin just very salty. There were some chicken pieces inside that were tasty but not enough protein for a filling meal. They give you hot water at the end if you want to drink it like soup. The food is quite tasty but I'm not sure if it's worth the $20 price tag. It's almost all carbs so you get hungry pretty quickly after. There are many lunch special options in the area for less than $15 that will leave you more filled.
Bora C.}North Bergen, NJ}147}50}8}-1}4}4/27/2016}Udon is okay. Soba is the bomb. The waitress was very friendly!! The soba really fresh. Great place, would come back.
Jon S.}Brooklyn, NY}123}642}1}18}4}4/25/2016}I'd passed this quiet looking spot many times while headed to the buzzier offerings on the other side of 9th street throughout the years. The sake bar, the okonomiyaki place, the burger place that opened in the booth where the okonomiyaki place used to be, the new location of the okonomiyaki place, and so on.When I finally stopped to see the menu, I saw a soba-centered menu with lunch and dinner sets. I didn't mess around with my first visit, bringing a friend for lunch. I went with the cold soba noodles and dipping sauce. It's simple quality, nice and firm, with just enough oil coming from the sauce to add a bit of flavor.For a place that struck me as quiet from the outside, there were plenty of people here on a Saturday for lunch, and I've read that waits aren't uncommon in the evenings. The crowd turns over fast so I doubt getting in would be too much of an issue. Our waitress, Japanese of course, also gave my friend advice about avoiding soy for an upcoming trip to the Japan. She also guided her through soy and non-soy options for this particular meal as well, providing a lemon and salt glaze for her don.I regret the portion size advice I gave to my friend. I told her to upgrade to a large don, as I assume things might be made for Japanese-sized bodies. It wound up being too much food for her. (Although I managed to finish all of the elements of my lunch set while feeling only slightly piggish.) Take that into advisement when going through the various options available.
Mark V.}København, Denmark}0}7}0}-1}5}4/24/2016}Wonderful place with relaxed quiet ambience. Service is considerate and attentive - just the way it should be. I will definitely come back.
Rebecca C.}Washington, DC}24}144}46}-1}4}4/23/2016}This little place deals mostly in soba (as the name indicates), but they also have very good rice bowls (don). I had the salmon oyako don (if I have the name wrong, sorry-- check out the pic) and it was very good and nicely presented. The service here is excellent and friendly. Next time I'm coming back for the soba.
Paulina V.}Brooklyn, NY}4}30}7}-1}5}4/23/2016}A great alternative to some of the busier soba/ramen/udon places in the area. There can be a wait and I recommend going either around 9:00PM or earlier than 7:30PM. It's been one of my favourite soba spots in the East Village area for a while and I take all my non-NYC visitors here. Recommendations: soba/udon with chicken and garlic (hot) and their tempura.
Stephanie W.}Brooklyn, NY}6}10}26}-1}3}4/21/2016}Expected better.  Some friends were dying to go so we finally made plans to go after work.  The place was crowded but we didn't have to wait.We really wanted to see them make the soba noodles but all we saw was an iPad.  What a disappointment!I got the Kamo Seiro (cold soba with duck in hot dipping sauce) because of the Yelp reviews.  It was SOOO bland!!! I was expecting something savory and hearty.  But it tasted like water.  I wanted to add soy sauce but there was only hot sauce at our table.  My friends got the tuna soba... I didn't get to try it, but they didn't seem that thrilled about it either. We ended with the green tea brûlée, which was DELICIOUS!  Definitely recommend that!!When we were leaving, that's when they started making more noodles.  We stayed long enough to make a video, very cool!
Ck T.}Manhattan, NY}0}16}0}-1}5}4/21/2016}Soba: al dente/firm to bite, cant make it by myself at homeAtmosphere: tranquil, birch wood
K.Y W.}Elmhurst, NY}22}150}2}-1}3}4/18/2016}Came here on a Friday night and the wait was around 30 minutes. My friends and I all ordered the cold soba and no one really raved about how great this is. I opt for the extra large and it was just enough to fill me up. If you're well over 5 feet and 110 pounds, extra large will not be enough for you! The cold noodle sauce wasn't amazing as compared to Cocoron. It's also a bit more expensive as compared to Cocoron.
Jonathan J.}Manhattan, New York, NY}23}17}2}-1}5}4/15/2016}Fresh-made soba is always a win. I say get them cold or with a side of fresh tempura and let the noodles speak for themselves.Great beer and sake selection too.One of my favorite places in the city.
Megan C.}New York, NY}1}22}76}-1}2}4/11/2016}I ordered a mini salmon don for lunch. Should've ordered a set or something else, because  the tiny rice bowl alone was $16. It is not made with sushi rice, and had 3-4 slices of salmon. Very disappointing.
Tracie H.}Brooklyn, NY}11}106}115}-1}3}4/10/2016}In looking for a place for lunch on weekday, we came upon this place. Never had soba before at a restaurant known for making them fresh. This was definitely an experience. It was packed inside with lunch crowd. We ordered the lunch box and the mini lunch . Mine came with rice & tempura & hot soba noodles (19.50) . There are options for cold /hot and then udon/soba noodles. Instead of tempura, there are such things as pork/chicken cutlets, shrimp, chicken, veggies, etc.Guess it was good , but I don't think I would be back. It's just not for me . And it's really small in here. Everyone is on top of one another. Of course, once I tried to get to my seat..I had to say excuse me to a guy whose seat was in my way and apparently it bothered him so much ..he was just like ugh,..didn't look up at me and reluctantly moved his chair in so I can get to my seat. I get it ..it's packed, but at least I said excuse me...JERK!
Kristina H.}New York, NY}2}36}43}-1}4}4/9/2016}You should try to have a sense of what you feel like eating because there are so many options on soba. Everything was fresh, and good. Gets packed early.
Weili H.}New York, NY}248}156}134}-1}5}4/9/2016}This review came too late, I've checked in 7 times, before the Yelp App I can't count how many times I've been here, I could come by myself, with a group of 2-3, lunch and dinner.I recommend coming in for lunch if you don't have a huge appetite, and it's less expensive. I still can't finish the whole lunch set...this is someone who could devour a whole Big Mac meal plus 2 apple pies and possibly a sundae. You get a try for a soba and a decent sized rice bowl.I LOVE the cold soba and either the salmon bowl or unagi bowl, all you need is a bit of wasabi and scallion, mix with your dry soba, dip in the sauce-soup...you will taste heaven. The unagi don is one of the best in the city, you get a good portion, it's grilled to perfection, their sauce is neither too salty or too sweet, just right. The salmon bowl is salmon sashimi and a quarter bowl of salmon roe, how could you not love that. If they create a set with cold soba and salmon bowl plus an una ju, they will have me every day for lunch!Turn over is quite high for small parties, if you come for dinner it could be a wait. The place is small and you get a crowded and noisy crowd. It's still one of my favorite spots in town though. Try the tuna wrapped in a bean sheet, dip in a avocado-rich dipping, it's sooo good. Their fried chicken was great with green tea salt too, but I don't see that on the menu anymore.
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}4}4/8/2016}The food here is pretty awesome, albeit a bit pricey. Nevertheless, the homemade soba noodles are certainly delicious. Soba-ya offers a good variety of cold and hot soba and udon dishes. Love the unique appetizers of their menu as well. Was a big fan of the fried fish skin in guacamole. There's a Monday through Thursday pre fixe dinner special from 5:30-7pm, which is a steal compared to the regular prices here. Dessert options are also quite good.Overall, service was great, lines can be long at times, and complementary green tea is a plus.
Bruce L.}Manhattan, NY}223}5}65}-1}2}4/5/2016}It's way overrated. Umm I was thinking to give a 3-star rating but the bad food quality prevents me from doing that.It's quite a popular restaurant and the 25 servings limited lunch box sounds attractive. But the experience is actually painful. The complimentary tea is worse than the tea comes out of tea bags. It tastes only slightly more than water with floating tea dusts. It's called Soba-ya so I have pretty high expectations for the soba. The soba is not that good. The noodles are shredded and the dipping sauce tastes bitter. I can't taste any fish essence from it, only the super salty soy sauce occupies my mouth. OK, let me try the Tempura. It tastes... painful. They are fried for too long and then get very hard. It's so much thicker than the thickness of good tempura. They don't drain the oil. Good tempura should leave no oil on the paper. You can smell the oiliness right after the waitress served the tempuras. The salad does not taste like Japanese salad. The rice is not seasoned either.It kept me drinking water for the rest of the day. The extreme oiliness even gave me loose bowel. I will never come back, except when I want to suffer.So, one star for the food, one star for the dessert. The dessert was good though.
Feed M.}Los Angeles, CA}93}35}30}-1}5}4/5/2016}Great ambiance. Great attentive service and Great Food.What more can you ask for??The only dilemma i experienced is deciding what to get.. like you have to get the soba noodles..(got the duck one because that's their forte) then you have to get the tempura because it just pares soooooooo well with the broth.. then.. you just have to get some salmon and ikura because that combination CANNOT be ignored!Can't you tell how happy I was eating here ^______^
Ben M.}San Francisco, CA}57}130}72}-1}3}4/3/2016}Good service but both cold and hot noodles were just ok.  Have better in LA...only go if there's no or minimal wait.
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}4}4/2/2016}Sometimes, I get random cravings throughout the day. This past Wednesday, it was for a bowl of warm soup with udon. Don't ask me why. When I got to the restaurant, I realized that I'd been here several years earlier when I was still interviewing for grad school. I don't remember having been super impressed the last time, but I decided to give them another try. At around 9PM at night (1 1/2 hrs before closing), the restaurant was surprisingly full, although we were probably one of the last parties to be seated for the night.I wanted something simple, yet satisfying, and since it was later at night, I went with a small Kake with udon under the hot noodles menu.  It was really simple - a clear broth, a piece of fish cake, and some blanched spinach - but it really hit the spot!! I know that I could have probably made something very similar at home for a minute fraction of the price, but I ate EVERYTHING, drank allll of the soup, and enjoyed every bit. #worthit I appreciate that they offer different sizes of the noodle dishes and a choice between either soba or udon, which helps to satisfy different cravings and makes sure everyone in the party can eat his/her fill!
Suyoung C.}Columbia, SC}23}5}1}-1}5}3/30/2016}I gave it up to have some good at this restaurant because of waiting. Finally I had a chance to eat it and then I could understand why so many people are waiting. Always wanted to have some soba but could not find any good place. Finally I found some place to have soba. It is a little bit expensive for what that it is. But I would love to go back to this place to have soba again. I don't want to put about service on this. Once food is good I don't care about the service.
Nick H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}308}289}529}18}4}3/28/2016}I came here with 3 friends around 1:30pm on a Sunday and it was much less packed than we were expecting, no wait at all.We had the salmon tartare bowl (mini), (2) unagi dons, and (1) tempura udon. I tried the udon and the unagiSalmon tartare: had plenty of kewpie mayo in it but my friend was very happy with it. A mini was enough to satisfy a moderate appetite. Benefits from some of the soy sauce on the table (which has been enhanced with bonito flakes, I think)Unagi: very nice sauce with depth of savoriness and not too sweet. The fish does have a few scales/bones to watch out for (traditionally, all the bones are still in the fish, just cut finely, I believe). Goes very well with the rice and the sauce.Tempura udon: First off, 150g of noodles is plenty, I didn't miss the extra 50g. The udon were nicely chewy but they will absorb liquid over time. The broth was nice and savory and I actually drank the entire bowl. The tempura came with 2 nicely sized shrimp, 1 shishito pepper, and 1 shiso leaf. The tempura was very delicate and well fried.Tea was a very nice dilute matcha. Service was very good.Atmosphere: 10/10Food: 9/10Value: 8/10
Annie K.}Manhattan, NY}12}75}222}-1}3}3/25/2016}Stopped by for an early dinner with a friend and it was pretty empty when we arrived. I ordered the early dinner special that came with starter side dishes, tempura, inzarizushi, soba noodles and vanilla ice cream with strawberry syrup. To be honest, the place was a bit expensive for the dishes. My friend ordered the hot soba instead. Both of us agreed that it wasn't worth the price. The soba was good, but it didn't taste significantly better than soba from somewhere else. The overall presentation was nice though.I would say come for lunch instead since its cheaper. Also, the lunch selection seemed more appealing than the dinner menu.
Ju L.}Bronx, NY}9}10}1}-1}1}3/24/2016Updatedreview}Very disappointing experiences since my first time I've been dining here, or maybe I'm just walking in on BAD DAYS?! The soup for hot soba/udon was very salty and sour. Our waiter got one of our orders wrong and argued with us when we pointed him on his mistake. We asked for hot stamina soba but he gave us plain hot soba, he was upset at US and told US "No. You ordered hot soba, i heard you." Maybe if you repeated the order with us instead of thinking your superior to mistakes, we would've tipped you 10% but we gave no tip because of his attitude. He had the nerve to chase us half way down the block and complain that we didn't tip him. We politely told him it was because of his attitude he gave us when we comforted him about his mistake and he told us "Don't bother coming back"!!!!Ok fine, not a problem. My last time...Then again, they weren't a legit Japanese place or professional. All the servers were old hispanic men checking out every female that got up from their chair and walked by!!! There was only 1 Japanese person in the entire restaurant, not even the chefs who were looking out from the curtains of the kitchen were Japanese. Not an authentic place. Wasn't busy either so that says a lot about their demand rate.
David H.}Brooklyn, NY}132}61}174}18}5}3/23/2016}Excellent place to get some soba especially during their happy hour. I've been working around the area for 4 years and now I finally try it and know what I'm missing.
Andrea C.}New York, NY}165}113}208}18}4}3/20/2016}My favorite place to go to for soba noodles. I've also tried their Sake oyako don before. It the salmon and roe were super fresh and quite delicious. There was a bit of a wait on the weekends. My group and I waited for about 30-45 minutes for lunch.What I really want to try next time is the tuna avocado don that I've been hearing so much about!
Winnie M.}New York, NY}288}19}191}-1}3}3/20/2016}Came with a group of friends and there was no wait. There was a person making the noodles in a booth in the front of the restaurant which really drew my attention. When he leaves, they place an iPad in the booth and show a video of him making noodles which I thought was a nice charm. I tried the curry udon and it was alright. It might have been the noddles I ordered but I didn't really see what the hype was about. My friends ordered sashimi and it appeared to be really fresh. Staff is attentive and professional. If you do come here, make sure to use the bathroom. The seats heat up!!
Rach W.}Gramercy, Manhattan, NY}1}110}5}-1}3}3/18/2016Updatedreview}Came back  here for lunch recently and noticed a serious decline in the ncquality of food. I ordered my usual yasai soba noodles and the noodles seemed a bit overcooked. The presentation also was not what it use to be. And they seemed to have eliminated the mini portion size from the menu. Service was still excellent but the food left little to be desired.
Akane G.}Brooklyn, NY}0}42}3}-1}3}3/17/2016}Taste is amazing. Loved the soba but does it have to be that expensive?! Maybe because it is too close to Japanese soba I compared and it is too expensive for the quality.
Stephanie S.}Washington, DC}147}145}53}18}3}3/14/2016}Definitely an overrated Japanese soba joint. Their buckwheat noodles are some of the best I had,  but the dipping sauce tasted no better than any store-bought sauce. I ordered a somewhat basic item, a regular-sized cold soba noodle with seaweed and a side of grated radish, and it came close to $15 just by itself. My husband ordered Tanuki with soba noodles. I would say avoid all warm noodle dishes if you are ordering buckwheat noodles to go with it, because buckwheat noodles by nature have no gluten, and they break off (and get very soggy) easily in heat. This was I guess a mistake on our part to order buckwheat noodle instead of udon noodles for the warm broth. But the broth itself was pretty mediocre too, and my husband refused to finish his food after a few bite. Pretty disappointed with the food here, not sure if I would recommend this place to anyone.
Xuenie Z.}Manhattan, NY}339}85}248}-1}4}3/11/2016}Soba ya is definitely worth the hype! The soba taste so delicate, and the simplicity yet flavorful soup was definitely a great choice for a late night meal. Very crowded on a Thursday night; had to wait 15 minutes when I came here at 9 pm. Love the hint of orange in my hot mushroom soba noodle soup; made me feel less bloated (compared to ramen) and compelled me to finish the whole bowl. The price is pretty expensive. For two bowls of hot soba noodles, the price after tip is around ~$50. Much more expensive than ramen but definitely worth it once in a while.
Steve S.}New York, NY}2}103}0}-1}4}3/10/2016}Great find! The food is absolutely delicious and flavorful. Presentation of everything from the drinks to the food itself is amazing. Service was outstanding and every dish had a unique quality to it. Definitely worth trying something you've never had before if you come here. Does get pretty busy, but not too long of a wait if you're only with one or two others.
Molly M.}Oakland, CA}0}2}0}-1}5}3/10/2016}BEST SOBA IN NYC!!! Go here 1-2 times a week. The service, food and quality are unbeatable.The hot Yasai with Soba is my house favorite. Simple, clean and delish!
Connie H.}Brooklyn, NY}2}89}2}-1}2}3/9/2016}My girlfriends and I wanted noodles so I suggested this place as I have been here and I remembered it wasn't bad. Bad choice.The hostess told us the wait is 30 minutes, which is fine since it's a Friday night and St. Marks. An hour later, our table was still not open. Needless to say my friends were anxious. Everyone had a rough week at work; the last thing we need was to starve and being lied to. Everyone in the waiting area was so anxious that the hostess got visibly annoyed with people asking her where their tables are. I'm sorry. You did not just open and you always had waits. I expect you to be efficient and you to at least be close in estimating the wait time. People were so pissed that they took the liberty to just sit themselves at any table that just opened up, which happened to be our table. They did nothing about it!They finally sat us down after 1.5 hours and the waiter was sweet. He was really nice to us knowing that we were on edge. We expected things comped at this point after that whole debacle. Instead we got 3 tiny pickled radishes. Whatever better than nothing. The rest of the meal was fine. Food was meh, but it was tasty enough. At least they were nice about trying to turn our table and get us out. The bill came out and I must have not paid the first time because I forgot how expensive things were here. I can't justify paying close to $30 for a bowl of noodles with extremely simple ingredients and deal with what we dealt with. Pass.
Shali W.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}77}67}49}-1}5}3/5/2016}It has replaced cha-an to become my favorite Japanese dessert place !
Josephine L.}Brooklyn, NY}377}28}4}-1}3}3/4/2016}My boyfriend and I were craving a hot bowl of noodles and randomly stumbled upon Sobaya a few months ago. Sad to say that despite the rave reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I thought the soba was okay and didn't think it was all that memorable. It was kinda expensive, portions were small and noodles were either too salty or flavorless. The staff at the restaurant were pretty awesome though. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things and we'll likely come back and try different dishes next time.
Yiwen Z.}Honolulu, HI}160}224}604}18}3}3/1/2016}ordered tororo soba and soft boiled egg.  was alright... nothing too fancy.my friend got the set and I love the side dishes(yam and pumpkin)also got the dessert bun. ice cream is way to strongly bitter, which not churned properly? has ice crystals in it.but presentation is elegant.
Alice L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}191}905}-1}4}2/29/2016}Came here for a dinner with a few friends. The place is very professional and clean. They are very polite and helpful with the menu if you're confused or indecisive. I had the Sake Oyako don. It consist of salmon sashimi slices, ikura eggs (salmon roe caviar), some wasabi, seaweed, lemon slices and rice at the bottom. On the side is soy sauce for your to pour in. It was delicious. The salmon sashimi slices were fresh. The whole dish wasn't bland at all which is a huge plus. Everything was seasoned well. There wasn't a temperature difference in the food. I had expected the salmon sashimi to be very cold while the rice was hot. However, that wasn't the case. The salmon sashimi was more on the warmer side. Visually, it was very appealing. The placement of each component caught my attention. It was clean and well positioned in the bowl. It comes in three sizes, small, regular and of course large.I wanted to try both the soba and the sashimi combinations. However, the set dinner one wasn't too attractive. It was dull compared to the set lunch ones. The set lunch ones had more fish options. The set dinner one only had one type. I was't too impressed by it.
Izy S.}New York, NY}0}15}14}-1}5}2/29/2016}Just had their lunch special (they only serve 25 a day, $21 each), it come with so much, I was stuffed for the whole day! If you miss their delicious lunch special, there's plenty on their menu to choose from. The soba noodles that came with the lunch was perfect, you can order it hot or cold (love it hot so I can put in the hot spicy pepper sprinkles and shrimp and veggie tempura. My favorite part was the boiled salmon and veggies. The rice with sesame seeds, ikura, and omlette was phenomenal too (not just your old plain white rice)! But the sweetest deal was at the end, they suprise you with a really delicious milk tofu, it really hit the spot! This is a solid lunch place I'd recommend to anybody.
G P.}Alexandria, VA}168}72}266}-1}3}2/29/2016}Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Service was slow overall since we literally have to flag a bus boy/waiter down for everything. We started with the Goma tofu and uni tororo. The tofu was delicious and had a unique smoky aroma and taste to it. I love chilled tofu since the texture is similar to a dense custard. The uni tororo was ok, the uni was good but the mountain yam has a funky slimy texture I'm not accustomed to. My entree was the broiled eel and hot udon mini lunch set. The presentation was beautiful but the quality was mediocre. The eel was the low point of this meal. The eel was so tough I could barely even break it up. If I had to come back I would get the tofu and try their other noodle dishes. However, the service and the proteins here were all subpar.
Yanghe L.}London, United Kingdom}170}4}2}-1}3}2/27/2016}Not that delicious. Ordered the cold soba suggested by the waiter. The spinach and eggs are good, but the taste of noodle is not satisfying.  Plus the price on the menu of Yelp is the smallest size, but I believe that normally every adult should have the biggest size, which is more expensive. Honestly I think that dish can be made at home with less cost and better taste.
Rylee K.}Manhattan, NY}1}28}0}-1}5}2/25/2016}Absolutely love this place! Grrrrreeat food! I don't think the staff is like, the best in the world, that is to say that it is not anymore outstanding than the one next door. However, they take your order correctly, and the food doesn't take SO long to come out. The place is clean, the bathrooms clean. No complaints by me! I always bring my friends here in cold winter days :)
Yannie H.}New York, NY}13}106}68}18}4}2/24/2016}I love this place! Great service and atmosphere, the food is good and so is the dessert. Will deff come back
Jenny K.}Manhattan, NY}0}98}57}-1}4}2/23/2016}I love this restaurant. The space is pretty crowded but more spacious than other Japanese restaurants in the East Village. The food is always delicious.
Nicky F.}New York, NY}282}148}503}18}4}2/21/2016}I was never really a huge fan of soba but this place's soba was pretty good! I had the uni soba and it was different than what I've ever tried. I would say that it could be a little saltier but the combination of uni and their house-made soba was pretty great. The line got pretty long after it opened so coming close to the open time would be the best. I didn't try their lunch menu but my friend said that it was good. The portions are pretty big and the soba soup at the end was really tasty!
Eileen C.}Manhattan, NY}221}1}17}-1}1}2/21/2016}The food is awful!!! The worst udon I have ever tried in my life. Please go to another restaurant.
Mason D.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}2/21/2016}The udon tastes awful, and the service is really bad, when I tried to leave, I was required to leave at least 15% tip, the worst restaurant ever
Aimee X.}New York, NY}403}84}156}-1}3}2/19/2016}Third time is a charm when it comes to actually getting a table at this small restaurant. I tried coming here two other times and the wait was over 2 hours. Finally, on this fateful night, I was able to be seated within 30 minutes with my party of 4. Safe to say, i was pretty excited to finally try the food here. Unfortunately, I wasn't super impressed. Appetizer: We ordered the tuna tartar tower which we saw on another table. The presentation was beautiful, in a nice little cube with layers of tuna, mountain yam and avocado. However, it lacked flavor and seasoning. Entree: I ordered the Kitsune which comes with fried bean curd, fish cake and boiled spinach. The soup itself is very light and not at all like the meat broth I've come to expect from ramen. The noodles itself was a bit tougher than ramen noodles but well made. The bean curd was soggy in my soup and the fish cake was tiny. Overall, very muted flavor profile. Maybe soba just isn't my thing since I kept comparing it to ramen, which is one of my obsessions. On a cold, dreary night, I still crave the warm, luscious broth of ramen over soba.
Yiru L.}Flushing, Queens, NY}0}26}8}-1}2}2/17/2016}Food is great but service is very disappointed. I ordered a lunch box $21. After I finished my meal , Kohei (waitress) offered me the dessert menu. I order " milk tofu " . Kohei took my order and after 3 minutes he came back. And notify me that my meal come with a mini dessert ( mini milk tofu )  and he said sorry. As a customer, I asked him if I could EXCHANGE my dessert order to something else.  Because I don't need both dessert to be the same. Kohei refused to change the order. I asked him why and he said the order is place in the kitchen already. Honestly, I feel I am being tricked. I am paying a full price for the dessert. ....Shame on the Kohei for his terrible service.
Daniel B.}Vernon Hills, IL}169}172}51}18}3}2/11/2016}Soba-ya has a great interior and is actually a really nice dining environment. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the food as much as I enjoyed the restaurant decor.The food itself wasn't actually bad; it just wasn't especially memorable. I got cold soba noodles, and they were quite nice with the broth that accompanied it. However, my rating is a reflection of both the portion size and the price. I wasn't thrilled with how much I paid for how little I got, and ultimately, that was what left the greatest impression on me. I ate with a party of 6 people, and none of us left feeling very full, so I don't believe I was the odd one out in this case. It's a nice dining experience, but it just didn't live up to high hopes I had.
Yuting Z.}Manhattan, NY}358}246}444}18}5}2/7/2016}Came here for the first time a few weeks ago, and left wondering why I didn't try it sooner. In fact, I dragged my friend here the very next week so I could have more of the delicious soba! I've tried:- Assorted vegetable platter (3 of your choice): we had the burdock, lotus roots, and eggplant. Nice refreshing way to start off the meal.- House-made tofu: the silkiest tofu I've had in the city! Bland, as plain tofu tends to be, but very tasty with the dashi and wasabi salt that come with it. Definitely tastes like it was made in house.- Stamina seiro: cold soba with a hot dipping broth on the side. This version had fried chicken and garlic. The dashi broth had hints of yuzu, which added a little kick.- Uni tororo: very fresh sea urchino over a pile of grated mountain yam. Mountain yam has a slightly slimy/sticky texture (think natto, if you've ever had that) and a funky taste that takes a bit to get used to. The uni was very fresh. My friend also got the cold soba that comes with this on top, and loved it.- Ten zaru: cold soba with shrimp tempura on the side. I've never been a tempura connoisseur, but even I could see that the quality of this was heads and shoulders over what's usually served. - Kamo nanban: hot soba with duck and green onions. Wasn't a fan of this, as the soba noodles were immersed in the broth (rather than coming on the side as in the cold preparations) and quickly became soggy. The broth also lacked the dimension that some of the other dishes I tried had. I would stick to the cold soba.- Nabeyaki: solid bowl of udon if you're not feeling like soba. Definitely holds up much better in the hot broth.- Desserts: tried the matcha creme brulee, sweet tofu, and anmitsu. All lightly portioned and not too sweet, a good way to end the meal.Definitely want to come back and try more of the (rather expansive) menu!
Amy L.}Brooklyn, NY}31}177}232}18}4}2/5/2016}Didn't expect it to be so packed on a Friday night by 6! Came here in a party of 3 and wanted to get the dinner special that ends at 7, but sadly found it was only offered Monday-Thursday. Nonetheless, we ordered the original sobas we wanted. It is kind of pricey for a regular noodle (~$20), but definitely worth every bite.I got the Kamo Nanban hot soba which had pieces of duck, scallion, and veggies. The broth wasn't very salty, which I prefer with noodles, and the duck wasn't like any duck I've had before. The meat was tender and sliced, so there was no problem trying to get it out of its bones or anything of the sort that is usually typical of Asian cuisine. I also tried some of my friend's tempura soba, which was amazing as well. The fried tempura was chewy and not too crunchy, setting the right amount of flavor of seafood and meat for the night. Service was great and you can actually see them make the noodles behind a small table they have set up near the entrance of the restaurant. The only thing that I noticed, which kind of annoyed me, was how rushed they seemed to clear our bowls and give us the check right after.
Kimberly C.}San Marino, CA}28}399}173}-1}4}1/29/2016}This place was amazing. I'm not entirely sure how we were so lucky to stumble upon the one time when there wasn't any wait. It was kind of overrun by NYU students getting the lunch special, but I was craving udon soup and plum wine. Although on the pricier side, every bite was worth it, and I'll definitely be coming back to enjoy the lunch specials!
Maggie Z.}Middle Village, NY}785}283}711}18}4}1/25/2016Updatedreview}I know that in my last review I said I wouldn't come back here, but I was in the area and decided to stop by because that okoya don was just so delicious!! The service was much better this time, so I suspect the place really was busy the first time I went. They handed us heated towels to warm up, the moment we were seated which is such a nice gesture. This time I got a regular sized don for $3 extra. This bowl is WAY bigger than the mini and definitely worth the $3!!
Janice K.}Commerce, GA}9}6}14}-1}3}1/24/2016}Tried the lunch box and lunch set set but it was not too good or not too bad. I dont know whats TOO special about this place but overall it was OK. The broiled fish was a little cold which disappoints but tempura was warm and tasty. Their service is very welcoming though!
Angie I.}Staten Island, NY}99}44}165}-1}4}1/24/2016}Highly satisfied with Soba-ya. The sake (salmon) sashimi was incredibly fresh and mouthwatering. Our party of 3 also enjoyed the ika meshi, which is squid stuffed with savory sticky rice. Thinly cut and served. I think we each would've enjoyed an entire order to ourselves. -Noted for my next visit. I had the fresh sea urchin with grated mountain yam dipping soba. So during this dinner I found out I was not a fan of Japanese mountain yam. The mountain yam tasted fresh but the lingering aftertaste just wasn't my plate of yam. The sea urchin was incredibly creamy and delicious. *Also the 3 different sizes does not change your uni portion, only the soba portion! I asked :) My friends ordered the oyster soba and the nabeyaki udon. I personally didn't enjoy either. I found the oyster soba too be too salty and the nabeyaki udon to be too plain. I will like to come back for the special lunch sets! The appetizers are definitely a hit and must get.
Joy W.}Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA}193}444}3122}18}4}1/18/2016}I've been craving soba ever since I had some good soba in Japan. This looked like a pretty good option. It had all the markings of a traditional noodle house with wooden furniture, paper windows, and fabric hanging over the doorway. It's also very clean.We ordered:Maguro Yamakake ($10) - soy cured tuna & grated mountain yamThe smashed avocado & tuna & seaweed strips were good, but that's always a good combination. However, I don't like mountain yum, so I don't know why we ordered this. Kamo Seiro ($19) - cold noodles & duck & green onions in hot dipping sauceCold soba noodles in hot dipping sauce were exactly what I wanted. The duck was a little tough. The flavors were mild, as was the broth. I'm pretty sure the other bowl was...Stamina Fried Chicken & Garlic ($18):The pieces of fried chicken had more flavor than the duck. The hot noodle soup warmed me up. It was delicious and satisfying. I thought the dishes were a little expensive, but when I consider the noodles are handmade in-house, I guess it's not too bad after all.
Mike T.}New York, NY}558}184}164}18}5}1/16/2016}Delicious in all aspects.  Come for the handmade soba. If you're lucky, you will see them being made in the booth that's front-of-house.  As you dine, marvel at their perfect uniformity.  Our go-to routine:  get a tuna avocado don (regular size) for an appetizer.  Tuna is marinated and very fresh.  Be sure to spot the hunk of wasabi amongst the avocado.Soba:  Stamina (fried chicken, garlic) is good and perfect for the not-too-adventurous.  Curry Nanban is very hearty and perfect for a cold day.  Customize your own hot soup by ordering Kake (noodles in plain broth) and add toppings to it.  Sake is heated in a warm bath and not microwaved or dispensed from a machine.
Jacques C.}Corona, NY}226}63}35}-1}4}1/13/2016}Can't beat the lunch box special here at Soba-ya, $20 for a good, filling meal! The soba here is well-regarded in NYC, so I had high hopes for oodles of noodles. Service here is great - very attentive and polite as well. Try to come early if you want the lunch box special, I believe they only have 25 per day!The Lunch Box: You have your soba & dipping sauce with scallions and wasabi, rice and fish roe, shrimp and vegetable tempura, pickled vegetables, broiled salmon, and dessert (tofu pudding with strawberries). All of it was quite good, my favorites were the tofu pudding and the tempura. The shrimp tempura were perfectly crisp and lightly seasoned, yet not oily at all. If you're wondering about the soba, the noodles had a good bite to them - I just wish the dipping sauce was a little stronger.Really great (and affordable) spot for lunch if you want some solid Japanese food in NYC!
Charlotte L.}Beltsville, MD}378}15}10}-1}5}1/12/2016}Super delicious. It was pretty expensive but definitely worth it. Amazing cold udon. And the honey wasabi ice cream is definitely as good as everyone says!
Kimmy K.}Richardson, TX}11}32}10}-1}4}1/9/2016}I had the warm soba noodle soup. Hmm, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps the cold soba may taste better. Didn't exactly pack the punch that I was looking for. Location was not hard to find. They have plenty of seats but lunch crowd is still really packed.
Funglin W.}New York, NY}793}444}59}-1}5}1/2/2016}I legitimately crave this restaurant every once awhile and I now tend to tend visiting guests here for lunch. I've only been here for lunch because their lunch specials are so delicious & so filling. Their cold soba is soooo good!Lunch Box Set for $21 (5) - If you want to get your money's worth, the lunch box set does just that. In addition, it will give you a taste of what Soba-ya is capable of. You get your choice of noodles (highly prefer the cold soba over hot soba / hot udon), then tempura, then an entire lunch box followed by dessert. Their cold soba is absolutely good and their dessert is so good too. Then, the lunch box gives you a big of roe, a bit of fish, etc...Lunch Set $19 (5) - I've only had the cold soba + sake oyaka don. I wish they gave a bit more salmon but only because everything about this lunch set is beyond belief good. If you're around St Marks, make sure you come here!
Kathryn A.}Pittsburgh, PA}210}29}93}-1}3}1/2/2016}This restaurant was not worth the hype. I was excited to try their homemade soba noodles and was disappointed with the lack of flavor in the noodles, and I got a curry dish! There are much better places that are cheaper. The service was also slow and we went at 9 pm at night.
Emmanuella Z.}New York, NY}61}140}199}-1}4}12/29/2015}I love soba-ya! I have been here a few times and finally decided to give them a review. Soba-ya is an authentic Japanese restaurant located near St. marks. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant every single time. All the decor is perfect too. I always have ordered the soba soups which have been good, but this time I ordered the lunch set. I got the Oyako Don with the soba, and other little things it came with. It was really good and all of it was made to perfection. The presentation of the food is always great at this restaurant too. It's always so perfect. I will definitely keep coming back here, because I want to try more of the things they have on their menu. The desserts are super good too. I like the strawberry milk tofu thing they have. The ice creams here are great as well.
Gaby B.}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}12/28/2015}This place is great!!! My favorite dish was the Kinoko (hot noodle) it was perfect!, it has a very good smoky flavor, can't wait to go back! And you also have to try the wasabi ice cream!
Hannah H.}Alexandria, VA}436}3786}28849}18}3}12/25/2015}About a 2-2.5: I've been wanting to check out Soba-ya ever since I'd heard that they serve up some great soba noodles.  Lunch, dinner, and a dessert menu is offered, and they have even offered some takeaway options for a party of 2.  The hubs and I came here for a quick lunchstop, and we were seated within 10 minutes - I was surprised, as the lunch rush was a bit ridiculous here!  I had the Tem Don, which was a shrimp and vegetable tempura over rice, with a small size of your choice of hot or cold soba or udon - I opted for the cold soba.  The tempura was extremely light in the batter, and it was okay; I preferred if there was some extra tempura sauce that came with the set, as it already came with a predetermined amount on the tempura and on the rice.  The rice itself was overcooked with a bit too much water, so it was on the mushy end.  The soba noodles were extremely small in portion, and they were pretty underwhelming - I really didn't see any difference between these and those you can purchase at the local grocery store.  The hubs had the Pork Katsu Don, which was a deep fried pork omelette over rice; he opted for the hot version of the soba noodles, and while the katsu itself was pretty okay, the sauce again was a bit too limited and came with a predetermined amount.  We both were not fans of the hot version of the soba, as the broth was watered down and not flavorful.  Each of the lunch sets came with a little side of pickled lotus root, a seasoned steamed pumpkin (which was pretty delicious), and some pickled cucumbers.  While the service was super friendly and attentive, the food was disappointing and I felt it was super overpriced for the amount and for the quality.  I'm glad I was able to finally check Soba-ya out, but won't be back!+watered down broth for hot soba+yummy steamed pumpkin side dish+friendly and efficient staff
Chloe L.}Brooklyn, NY}8}147}91}-1}3}12/25/2015}Tried this place out for the first time with my food-buddy.We both had the warm soba noodle soup.  hmmmm, was not what i expected.Maybe the cold soba would be better.For the similar price comparing to Ootoya, their uni was not as fresh.Presentation wise was overall good with the dishes, oh, the vegetarian appetizer Pumpkin, do not order, it was like a small complimentary dish you would get from going to Korean restaurants. Servers were attentive, but, since they had lines waiting, they were rushing you too in a very obvious way.  e.g, after we received our deserts, we received our check at the same time!  She came by many times to ask if we are finished when we are still eating.  I understand why but then, i don't want to understand it, it's rude.
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}4}12/23/2015}Going along with my theme of refusing to order the one dish that is in the restaurant's name or that the restaurant is best known for, I ordered the salmon avocado rice bowl instead any of the soba dishes. As a general note, Soba-ya's lunch is unequivocally a better deal than any of the dinner items: as part of their lunch set, you get a small noodle AND a small rice bowl, whereas for dinner, you can pay $3 extra for a small bowl of soup and pickles for your rice bowl, and then shell out $20 for the two desserts you scarf down at Spot. Just kidding, I'm especially gluttonous, but for a normal person, the regular-sized salmon avocado bowl is more than enough. They pack in a lot of delicious rice along the bottom, with generous chunks of salmon and sesame-dotted avocado. Drizzle in some soy sauce, and you've got yourself a salmon avocado sushi in a bowl. I tried a sip of my friend's noodle broth, which, though flavorful, tasted bitter and medicinal. If you're (inconspicuously) dining alone, rest assured that Soba-ya has a small bar space in the back. NEXT TIME: lunch deal, broiled eel don, duck soba
Song C.}San Francisco, CA}486}379}159}18}2}12/22/2015}Wow! I was so excited to try this place but overall I was really disappointed! I'm a pretty easy person to please when it comes to food. I'll eat almost anything and have no dietary restrictions. Sad to say but I don't think I will be coming back for more and here is why.I think it's just me and what I like. I felt that the broth was light and clean but also boring and bland, a little too sour for my taste. While I love Japanese food, sushi, and noodles (I can eat Pho everyday) I probably wouldn't eat this again. I also don't do ramen too much because I think the broth can be a bit on the heavy side. *Therefore, read this review with caution.* It really depends on what you like.If you like the clean/bland broth then this would be a great place for you. I thought the noodles were fresh but again, bland, not much to be desired after. I ordered the duck noodle bowl ($20), and the duck itself was good but not as good as Chinese Peking Duck. Left me wanting more.Didn't blow my socks off and I didn't feel like I was getting a good bargain when there are so many other places to eat near the St. Marks area that are cheaper and more flavorful. I really wanted to like this place but maybe Soba is not my thang?
Joyce L.}Brooklyn, NY}25}241}310}-1}4}12/20/2015}Got the salmon sashimi don with cold soba lunch set and it was really good. It is somewhat pricy for lunch but the food was awesome quality. The soba is nice and chewy and very fresh. The soba was truly the star of the meal but the salmon son was also very good. It had large pieces of salmon sashimi and tons of salmon roe. I just wish the rice had more vinegar in it which would have enhanced the flavor a lot. This is hands down the place to go for soba but the lines are always long on the weekend.
Sophia X.}Manhattan, NY}330}55}65}-1}4}12/20/2015}Really good comfort food. Got the soba with oysters and katsu curry udon. Both were good! Oysters were plump and well seasoned (vinegar taste was quite strong so it's more like a pickled dish). Grated radish in the broth balanced out the acidity and gave it a refreshing touch. Udon was nice and chewy too, and complemented well by the curry!
Joey Z.}Flushing, NY}0}8}41}-1}4}12/13/2015}I went there on Sat 1:30pm. They told me 30mins wait... ....I like the soba but a little pricey. I would love to try the cold soba next time.
Katherine S.}Forest Hills, NY}3}20}20}-1}3}12/9/2015}Had heard about this place for a while before finally being able to make it, and I'm glad we did - even if the food and service weren't up to expectations, at least now we know. Tips: arrive with a party of 2, they seem to get seated appreciably faster (lots of 2 seaters) and be very clear about hot or cold, maybe repeat yourself.We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday, and were given a wait time of 30-40 min for a party of 3. Fine, understandable for a popular noodle place in the east village. Come 9:30 we were finally seated, and ordered two hot sobas and one cold, expressly so - my friend pointed at the name on the cold menu. Unfortunately the waiter came back with 3 hot, prompting my friend to apologetically ask that he bring a cold soba instead, upon which the waiter stood there and argued while the rest of us backed our friend up. Ultimately we did get the cold soba we wanted, but it was an unpleasant interaction to start off the meal.The noodles themselves were decent - broth a little salty for my taste but I did enjoy the options for small / medium / large as I usually get too full for the entire bowl. A little disappointing overall given the hype, but a decent meal. Would probably go again if a friend wanted to, but won't be seeking it out myself.
Kenneth Y.}New York, NY}342}97}172}-1}4}12/6/2015}This restaurant was overall very nice, with a very lively atmosphere, good service, and great food.We were promptly seated, and the food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. I got the Kamo Nanban with soba, and it was really good. The meat was very tender, but I wish it had a little more flavor (as the noodles and broth are very subtle). The ponzu sauce was a little too strong for me (the tartness of the lemon was a little distracting), but the duck taste was still there. The soba itself was of course amazing. You can tell it's made fresh, and sometimes they get the chef to prepare the noodles outside of the kitchen at the front of the restaurant. The broth was okay; maybe the taste wasn't for me, but I thought it was a little salty. Anyhow, all components together worked very well, and the Regular portion was enough to fill me up. My friend got the Tuna Steak Don, and I had a bite. The tuna was cooked amazingly well, and the color was very nice. Ask for extra garlic sauce because that stuff is REALLY good. The price is pretty average for Manhattan, so I think the restaurant is worth its cost. I'd definitely come back again!
ML H.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}12/6/2015}Ordered the seasonal special with grilled sardines.  Very good.  But considering I paid $24 for what was basically a $24 bowl of soup, it better be good.  I'd return but try something else next time.  Seemed very authentic.
Austin C.}New York, NY}562}12}1}-1}5}12/6/2015}Came here 3 times in the last month because I live so close. To be honest, you can tell that it's good from the outside due to the long lines during weekend lunches and weekday dinners. Even though there are a lot of good/decent Japanese places on 9th st close by, Soba-Ya seems to outshine the competition. Compared to the next door Robataya, it's wayyyy better (if you're gonna spend $30+ on a meal, don't spend it at Robataya where you get like 0 food lol.)I got the Grilled Eel (Una-ju) rice box set, which luckily comes with a serving of either hot or cold soba or udon. Mmm. Obviously get Soba because this place is called Soba-ya. I think the price is absolutely worth it for the quality and the service, and you shouldn't skip on the dessert either. Got the red bean bun with green tea matcha ice cream. Super cool cause the bun actually has the Soba-Ya logo etched onto the dough..! 5 stars, gonna come back soon for sure.
Giang-Tien M.}Princeton, NJ}2900}1161}4177}18}4}12/4/2015}Soba-Ya has been on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list at least in 2012 and 2016. Upon my arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar.I ate their lunch bento box with salmon and roe, a lightly battered shrimp tempura, interesting vegetable pickles, in addition to the warm delicious soba noodles in a broth. I like the lightly battered shrimp tempura wasn't greasy. The texture of the soba noodles and the shrimp tempura were delightful.The dessert was a tiny custard with a strawberry on top.Everything was tastefully presented and fresh.The quality was high, but the portions were small. I was still hungry after my tasty lunch. I may come back to try instead the Uni soba noodles.The service was fine. The clean decor is soothing. Bathroom are available.
Alyssa Y.}New York, NY}69}240}39}18}3}11/28/2015}Definitely the spot for soba in the area, but that's not saying much. Not worth the wait, in my opinion, but if you're craving soba at an off -peak time, it's worth the visit.The noodles are made in-house and were well done, but I found the broth way too strong and overpowering. Apps were overpriced and nothing special, so stick to a soba dish and call it a night.
Janet L.}Bronx, NY}0}93}0}-1}5}11/27/2015}The lunch box set was AMAZING!  Shrimp tempura was crispy but moist inside and the miso-glazed fish was perfectly cooked.  Really enjoyed all the pickles and the milk pudding desert was yummy.  Staff is very friendly and professional.  Love this place!  So authentically and carefully made and the price is very reasonable.
Jasmine X.}San Francisco, CA}791}1097}1508}18}4}11/26/2015}Pretty good stuff. Have been wanting to try Soba-ya for awhile, so I stopped by on a rainy Thursday afternoon. Soba-ya serves up a nice variety of soba and udon dishes. I went with the pretty simple early bird dinner special -- $20 for vegetable appetizer, soba dish with shrimp and vegetable tempura, and vanilla ice cream dessert. The vegetable appetizer was pretty decent, though definitely an interesting curation of things. To be honest, I'm not 100% sure what I was eating, but most of it was okay. The soba was pretty decent, what you would expect for plain soba. And the vanilla ice cream was decent too.Overall, not much to say given how plain and simple everything I got was... but it was all executed pretty well -- it's easy to mess up the texture of soba or have not good dipping sauce, but Soba-ya executed really well, and everything was pretty seamless in terms of serving speed. Pretty great experience, and definitely a place I'd return back to if I want Japanese noodles.tldr; yummy soba! pretty reasonably priced given NYC
Wanda C.}Manhattan, NY}162}3}4}-1}3}11/24/2015}I had the charishi hot soba noodle which consisted of the fish cake, egg, and spinach. It was decent for the most part. Service was decent. Came for dinner and had available seating.
Wesley C.}Holmdel, NJ}5}9}0}-1}3}11/22/2015}Going to preface this with the notion that I eat a lot and probably ordered the wrong thing. Given that this restaurant is so popular we had a 45 min wait for our group of 5, Saturday night. So we waited no problem, understandable. I found myself staring into a empty glass box where they supposedly made their soba? I guess they make it fresh, I hope? Maybe they made a huge batch during the day? I'll get into the Soba later. So we finally got a table, or rather a booth because the hostess said that we had relatively "small people" basically, that we can squeeze into a booth on the right side of the restaurant. Ok I guess that's fine, better than waiting for another set of tables to finally open. (Make Note: I'm about 6 feet 185lbs and a decent eater and rest of the table was below 5'7") So I was finally excited to order their famed Soba and I love Uni so the decision stood out to me immediately. UNI SOBA! Bam, gotta get it. However I noticed on the side orders that 3 pieces of Uni was 7 dollars? So maybe I should have gotten something else and gotten Uni on the side, but I thought the bowl of Uni Soba was something special.....Sadly mistaken. for 25 dollars basically (their "Regular" bowl") it was literally a bowl of Soba, and 3 large pieces of Uni on top. Made me think if I ordered a bowl of Soba on the side and a side order of Uni would I have paid a cheaper price? Remember I'm a decent sized dude so this did NOT fill me up. I thought it was a meal set that would come with some other goodies on the side... no.... no pickles, no vegetable tempura on the side, nothing. Literally, Soba, sauce, 3 piece of Uni on top. That was my tray. Although I will say that the Uni pieces I did have were huge and delicious, bigger than others I've gotten. After tax and tip 30 bucks, needless to say I went around to 2 bros for a dollar slice... big guys gotta eat! I'll take some of this blame for ordering the wrong thing off their vast menu thus the "A-OK" rating. Perhaps I paid for a quality of the flavors as opposed to the quantity.... The soba I must say is different form the other places I've gotten it. It had more bite to it and was fresh tasting. The difference in flavor wasn't huge, but the texture is what made it stand out above the rest. Does the higher price justify the small difference IMHO, not really? I think I'm better off getting something else with a side of Soba as opposed to Soba being the main. TL:DR: Soba noodles negligible difference compared to others, but still slightly above the rest. Do not get the "Uni Soba", highly priced with no other frills or sides. Get something else and order Uni on the side.
anon r.}Bethesda, MD}1}106}6}-1}5}11/21/2015}So worth it. I was wondering if the lunch box would be "just another large bento,"but the presentation was beautiful, the miso salmon nuanced, the service helpful. Wish I still lived in nyc!
Sebastian C.}Palo Alto, CA}194}25}1}-1}1}11/21/2015}Not quite sure why this restaurant is still around. Terrible soft, powdery soba noodles. Tempura w batter that is too thick and oil soaked. The food is mediocre.The service is also abysmal. There was a male 'manager' that was so rude. I called back after leaving my card and all he could say was that it was 'not his responsibility' repeatedly.
Nilsa L.}Brooklyn, NY}56}262}285}18}4}11/20/2015}I was around the area a little before noon and saw on their menu that they have a lunch set that they only make 25 orders a day. So I walked around a little more and went in at noon. I was greeted by the friendly staff once I walked in. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. I was seated at the bar and was given a towel immediately. When my lunch set came, it was a bountiful of food and I quickly went into attack mode. I started with the salad. It was simple but the dressing was really good. It also had tofu pieces in it which was really soft and silky. Next, I went for the rice and salmon. The rice had black sesame in it, egg pieces on top and fish roe. The salmon filet was marinated well but I wish the skin was a tad bit for crisp. After I finished, I tackled the big bowl of hot soba and shrimp tempura. The soba itself had good texture but I'm not crazy about the soup. It had the burnt charcoal taste to it. The shrimp tempura were fried with a light batter. By the time I was eating the tempura, I had finished a lot of food already. By the time I was done with the food, then I was presented the little pod of strawberry flavored tofu pudding. It was smooth, just sweet enough, and I definitely wish I could have more! I could live without the strawberry piece on top of the tofu pudding because it was a little bitter. As a side note, I also love their bathroom. It's nicely decorated that made me even want to stay inside to look around. They burn an incense in there so you kind of don't think you're actually walking in a bathroom. For a restaurant bathroom, this one is pretty zen. I can't wait to come back to try other things on their menu!
Yuna L.}Manhattan, NY}61}1}0}-1}1}11/16/2015}This place is ridiculously overrated and not worth the money at all. People who think that this place is very japanese or legit are stupid i would say..... Just terrible overall. Will never go back.
Ted T.}Brooklyn, NY}3}34}17}-1}3}11/15/2015}Would've given 5 stars, if it weren't for your rude hostess. (Yes she made the experience that bad....)* best soba in the city! Be warned, their portions are big (a medium will fill you up). I recommend either the tempura set or the chirashi* appetizers are tasty, but pricey for their portions. Chawamushi is delicious, but we finished it in 3 bites.....*again, servers are very friendly and responsive but the hostess can be quite a buzzkill - poor table management, very snappy and condescending, and likes to use her default "table will be in 5 mins" despite waiting times ranging from 30mins to more than an hour...at least try!Overall, great place for good soba....just dont mind the hostess
Fay C.}Brooklyn, NY}358}12}3}-1}3}11/14/2015}Long wait. Cramped tables. Soba was alright, not the best. Soup base tasted like soy sauce. Took a wrong order even though we said the name and pointed to it on the menu. Over all it's okay.
Sandy P.}Queens, Queens, NY}57}76}151}-1}5}11/12/2015}I stopped by here a few weeks back with my sisters for lunch, and we waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table. Which was fine because they had someone behind a glass making soba by hand. It was very impressive and entertaining.The host was very lively and apologized for the wait several times and even asked if we wanted to sit anywhere else because we had insisted on the booth. The decor was very traditional and made us feel as if we were actually dining in Japan. The main soba dishes were average but the desserts were not! Till this day I can't stop thinking about how the mint garnish had gone so well with the desserts and how it just melted in your mouth. The milk pudding was my favorite. Staff was very knowledgeable and attentive!
Lauren C.}New York, NY}12}48}0}-1}2}11/11/2015}I want to love ya, but I can't - for two reasons:1) Your hostess needs to get her act together. Friday night, 7PM, everyone is waiting for a table. I have a party of 3, but you proceed to seat 6 groups of party of 2s before seating us. Yes, we waited more than an hour for a table because the hostess decided we weren't valuable enough to hold an extra table for. We were extremely hungry and politely told her we would be more than happy to squeeze 3 people into 1 small table - alas, she refused and assured us our table would be ready in 5 minutes...(more like 30 more minutes).2) Your hot soba is tasty...for the first 10 bites or so, but then the brininess and flatness of the soup really started to hit us. I overheard a table next to use describe it as "soy sauce soup" - not too far off.Unfortunately, there aren't many soba-centric Japanese restaurants in NYC. I'll come back if I'm in the neighborhood and REALLY craving it, otherwise I'll stick with Cocoron in LES.
Geekar L.}Brooklyn, NY}96}326}1256}18}4}11/4/2015}I would like to start by saying, I am in no way a soba fan. If I had a choice between soba and ramen, I would make that choice in a heartbeat, ramen! That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the soba here; the texture was on point. I have had soba before, but it wasn't Soba-ya! This place is popular for a reason and everything about this place makes it a comfortable dining experience. My friends and I got here at 6:30 on a Friday night and our wait was estimated to be 45 minutes, we were seated in less than 20 minutes, win! We quickly scanned the menu and decided on the agedashi tofu, two hot sobas and a cold soba.The agedashi tofu was fried tofu perfection, I can see why it's recommended most. I had the Kamo Nanban hot soba, which had a good amount of flavor, more on the vinegar side along with a good clear broth. My friends ordered the Ten Zaru cold soba and the Kinoko hot soba. They both like their soba and the broth for the Kinoko was nice and light. The service is really good here as well. They had brought my friend her sobayu (soba water) when she was almost done with her soba. I'm sure it's rich in nutrients and tastes ok when mixed with the dipping sauce, but it's not really my thing. This place is definitely worth a try whether you like soba or not, you might just end up liking it!
Harry T.}Grand Central Station, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}11/4/2015}I enjoyed last night and it was really a great place. Compared with famous soba restaurants in Japan, no less competitive.
Tina W.}New York, NY}421}905}1193}18}4}11/2/2015}Location: Soba-ya is rival with other delicious Japanese restaurants on E9th street. However, it stands out fairly since the front decoration is very Japanese traditional style. When you stepped into the restaurant, you will be intrigued by the inner decoration - wood led tables, chairs, and so on. But the space is really limited so that you may end up eating your food without much private space. Food: I was there during lunch time around 2pm. They still offered lunch box, which consists of small size of soba noodles, small size of Udons and some other small dishes. I had cold soba, with eel udon. I particulally love their eel udon. Eel is usually cooked with sweet sauce, and eating with rice is perfect. Soba is also good, with the cold sauce. Price: only less 20 for a lunch box to try their remarkable food. And end up in a full stomach. I think it is a great deal.Overall: I would say a 4 star is pretty accurately describing my whole experience there. Oh, get their early or you will end up waiting for a long time
Yuka Y.}Brookline, MA}427}335}1116}18}4}10/29/2015}Fairly fancy soba place in East Village. Zero wait time on a Friday @ 12:30pm. Definitely go for their lunch sets; either their "mini lunch boxes" or their "lunch box". Lunch box= exclusively only 25 servings/day. Mini lunch boxes entails a small rice bowl of your choice + small size noodles of hot or cold soba; it's satisfying for those who don't want to be grossly full and get dessert elsewhere in East Village. Rec: ++Sake oyako don "mini lunch" set $14: salmon sashimi + salmon roe over rice. Beautiful presentation with hand made soba.Interesting quirk: With every cold soba ordered, a square wooden pot will be given to you after you finished eating your noodles.The purpose of the pot is to pour the hot liquid into your dipping sauce so you can drink it as a diluted broth afterwards. Service is fairly quick and impersonal.
J C.}New York, NY}7}35}3}-1}5}10/25/2015}Soba-ya, you are the wind beneath my wings.After trying the uni soba for the first time last summer, I vowed to never eat anything else for the rest of my life. It's THAT good. Sadly, I had to leave NYC in September and couldn't live up to my promise... I resorted to eating other things to, you know, stay alive.BUT NOW I'M BACK FOR GOOD! And I've seriously been hitting this place up like it's my job. Somehow, the food gets better every time I go. It's the perfect restaurant - cold noodles to beat the summer heat, hot noodles to warm you up on a chilly winter's eve, and some pretty dope desserts for any temperature. Soba-ya never disappoints, unlike all the boys in my life. I LOVE YOU, SOBA-YA.
J D.}New York, NY}1}297}6}-1}2}10/23/2015}Ordered large udon soup.  $22?  That's a new price point.  Especialy did not like the sour tasting broth.  The ingredients in the soup were dissapointing too. Tempura shrimp, fish cake,  & chicken - all tasteless.
Bin L.}East Elmhurst, NY}29}348}14}18}5}10/22/2015}Serves authentic Japanese udon, soba, and sashimi don. Place is somewhat small. Waiters are mostly non-Japanese, which is not uncommon in the city.
Cynthia D.}Queens, NY}454}803}5869}18}5}10/18/2015}After cravings for soba noodles, my siblings and I decided to head over to Soba-Ya for our Sunday lunch. We arrived just about 20 minutes before the doors open at 12:00 PM, therefore we decided to look at the outdoor menu in the time being. As each passing minute goes by, there is a line forming right behind us. When we finally looked behind us, it was already twenty-three people (yeah... we actually counted :P). We just happened to be the first party on the line but we really did not expect there to be a line for a Sunday lunch. Be sure you get here early! When we finally walked in, we could not stop complimenting how simple, neat, and modest the decor was. Furnish wooden tables, chairs, and the bar counter. We sat down at our table and we are already ready to order!  My siblings and I each got the Lunch Box Set in which only 25 are served each day based on first come first serve for only $19.50. Lunch Box Set comes with your choice of Hot or Cold Soba Noodles, Shrimp or Vegetable Tempura, as well as a box with broiled salmon, various pickled vegetables, ikura rice, and salad.The star of our lunch was definitely the buckwheat soba noodles! Cold soba noodles come on top of a bamboo layer on top of a plate and a cup of soba dipping (tsuyu) sauce with wasabi and scallions - just add everything! Dipping sauce was the perfect flavor companion for the perfect chewy soba noodles. So delicious!Shrimp Tempura was crunchy and flaky. Since it was just lightly salted, I added the red chili pepper powder from the table that added so much more flavor! Broiled salmon was a generous piece and the skin was nicely charred and chewy. Pickled veggies came with cucumber, carrot, lotus root, sweet yam, and this amazing cup of tiny mushrooms, mountain veggies soaked in this yuzu oil! There is also a salad topped with tofu and Soba-Ya's ginger dressing to kick it up the notch! Lastly, our dessert was served - tofu pudding topped with preserved strawberry and a peppermint leaf. This small little dessert was just the sweet perfect ending to our meal! A future visit is just around the corner!On A Side Note: We overheard a Japanese man slurping very loudly and verbally complimented the soba noodles. In Japanese culture, slurping loudly is considered a compliment to the chef. The louder you slurp, the bigger the compliment! Also, slurping also maximize the deliciousness - there's science behind this. That's really cool!
James V.}Long Island City, NY}0}15}3}-1}5}10/17/2015}The tempura soba was authentic. I wish the prices here resembled the Tokyo prices a bit more, but they're booked out and this is the city we live in!
Jenny S.}New York, NY}50}38}210}-1}3}10/17/2015}Come on friday night, wait for 10 mins, I order a regular cold soba, my fiend order a tuna don set, noodle is okay and portion is small. The tofu appetite taste very good, consistent texture.
Nuj A.}WALL STREET, NY}0}3}0}-1}2}10/16/2015}Service was pretty good. Presentation is sufficiently elegant in what one might call typical Japanese esthetics. BUT, for a noodle house, the broth is a pretty much a let down. How can a noodle house fail on the broth? (I can hear my dad laughing at this attempt at a broth.) Said broth, essentially tasted like water, with a lot of soy sauce, some bonito, and tub of salt. If you need to up the sodium count in your blood by 10 fold go here. Otherwise, most random Vietnamese or Chinese places can give you more sophisticated noodle soups for half the price.
Caroline K.}Queens, NY}323}427}37}18}3}10/11/2015}I lurve Japanese food anythang.  Came here for a late impromptu dinner with my manpiece after a night out on the town and we got to ordering right away.  I opted for the tuna yamakake (?) soba while he had his Stamina fill.  I'll admit, I kind of had food envy because they did his so well, but that's only if you're veering on the greasy side.  Mine was much more subtle in taste and definitely cleaner, but I wasn't feeling too full either, which may be a good thing.We shared a bottle of sake (again!) as well as their green tea creme brulee.  I felt like it was probably sitting out for awhile, but it was still good.  I love soba, and I definitely want to come back to try the other options on their menu.
Mai Y.}San Jose, CA}132}301}1506}18}4}10/11/2015}Sobaya made me feel like I was back in Japan. The food tastes very authentic and the décor feels homey. I came before 5:30p.m. on a Sunday and the 4 of us were seated immediately. After about 10 minutes, the restaurant was packed and people started lining up for a table. We were really glad we beat the rush. There are a lot of both cold and hot udon and soba options and you can also choose what size you want. They have a good assortment of appetizers and donburi as well. Everything I had was really delicious. It's simple comfort food at its finest. On to the food:   Uni Tororo Soba- Best decision ever!! The uni tasted fresh and there was a decent amount of uni in this dish. The soba noodles were the perfect texture. They are handmade and are comparable to what you can get in Japan. At the end of your meal, they give you soba-yu which is the hot water they use to boil the soba. You mix it with the soba tsuyu (the dipping sauce) so you can drink it like soup. Nabeyaki Udon- Came out piping hot and includes a piece of tempura shrimp. The soup was very flavorful and delicious. Assorted Tempura- The tempura batter here is really good. It doesn't taste too oily and adds the perfect crunch to each piece of tempura. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly. The shrimp was still soft and the batter was crunchy. Agedashi Tofu- A good simple dish. The dashi added good flavor to the tofu. I've been here twice now and love the food here!
Patrick A.}Kirkland, Canada}66}36}0}-1}4}10/10/2015}Got the basic Zaru Soba. I appreciate how they offer a wide range of variations with 3 sizes of each.Soba tasted very fresh, however the dipping sauce wasn't as great as the one I had at Soba Nippon.Busy restaurant, but seats open up quickly. Staff is friendly and service is good.
Zach R.}New York, NY}77}13}6}-1}4}10/10/2015}Fresh homemade soba noodles, nice portions, friendly service. If you're looking for something different then ramen or pho then definitely check this place out if you're in the village.
Real M.}New York, NY}5}301}0}-1}3}10/9/2015}I ordered the $25 assorted sashimi and a mini Oyako Don. The sashimi, a bit lacking in quantity, wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. And the Oyako Don was just okay, but it didn't blow me away. Could have used a bit more flavor.I was craving Japanese food all week, and this place just didn't quite do it for me. I had a bite of my wife's udon, and that was decent. I just want more dining pleasure for $35/person.
Kelly E.}New York, NY}117}394}56}18}4}10/6/2015}I love sobaya - hit it up during lunch time for the lunch sets (you get a plate of soba or udon cold/hot; some pickled veggies, and your choice of some don-bowl). Great deal, very authentic, and great deal for the price!
Anny S.}New York, NY}141}139}725}-1}4}10/5/2015}Some of the best soba in NYC. Got the dinner special for $20 for vegetable appetizer, shrimp / vegetable tempura, choice of either cold or hot soba or udon, and an ice cream dessert. Great value. Would come back to try out their sushi and uni soba.
Michelle L.}New York, NY}825}520}1556}18}5}10/5/2015}This is one of my favorite soba places. When I can, I come right when it opens at noon during lunch on weekends to get their lunch box with cold soba ($17). Great portions that leaves me full when I am done. Given the price and the amount of food given, I feel that its  fair. At the end of the meal, it even comes with a small sweet egg custard. My favorite. Soba is fresh and al dente. Tempura is delicately fried. The Bento box is just a great combination of food. I think the only negative I have experienced there was the uni tororo. It just wasn't to my liking. The grated yam made the dish particularly slimy. Regardless, I will always come back for more of their lunch box special.
S C.}Los Angeles, CA}48}26}0}-1}4}10/4/2015}I was recommended to this place by a Japanese friend and after bringing my parents here, they always request to be brought back whenever they visit the city. The soba noodles here are really good. Not your typical gray buckwheat though. It's their specialty so don't expect to find many other food choices. They have a guy at the store front showcasing how they make it. Pretty cool. Try going there at a non rush hour period if you wanna avoid the long lines!
Michael G.}Cambridge, MA}4}38}0}-1}4}10/4/2015}It was a little difficult to get seated with an awkward number of people (3) -- it seems pairs would get seated pretty quickly -- but overall a good experience. There was nothing special about the duck appetizer (though it was cooked nicely, and had a very ducky flavor) nor the fried (pike?) fish special, but the katsu curry udon special overcame any minor negative feelings I had. It was amazing and was enough to have had as the entire meal. I will go back just for that.
Sylvia L.}New York, NY}323}194}275}-1}4}10/1/2015}I give this place a 3.5 stars; this place was not as great as I thought it would be. I came here with my boyfriend after class one night; he ordered the Nabeyaki Udon and I ordered the Hot Tempera Soba. I was not a big fan of my bowl of noodles, especially the soup base. It was so salty and tasted burnt. The noodle itself was really good though. The texture was nice and soft. However, I had to use my boyfriend's udon soup base because I just couldn't use mine. It made the noodles tasted bad. My boyfriend liked his bowl of noodles. It had a lot of different things in it which made it looked really good and it was good. I ate a good portion of his bowl myself and kept offering mine to him, hahaha. Overall, it was an okay experience. All the workers are very tentative and nice. Maybe I picked the wrong choice this time, so I would come back and try something else.
Trinh And Laurie L.}Brooklyn, NY}46}127}216}-1}5}9/30/2015}A-MA-ZING !!!This restaurant is a hit ! This is the kind of place you go without any expectation and you get out full of joy and magic. Definitely in our top restaurants list now and a place we will be regulars. The udon and the soba were delicious and the broth was perfectly seasoned. We had them with the Kamo Nanban (duck) ($17.25) which was good. We also had a spicy salmon don ($15) which was just perfect. The salmon sashimi ($13) we had as a starter was very good (but nothing to jump around)When we ordered, we chose a small soup + a small don thinking that it would not be too much but actually we were not able to finish our meals. So the advice would be to only share one additional dish as the portions are sufficient.
Vivienne S.}New York, NY}43}7}9}-1}5}9/18/2015}One of my fav soba places, Sobaya offers a very wide range of soba, both cold and hot. However, do keep in mind that this is a bit pricey for noodles, but they do offer lunch specials and early bird dinner deals on weekdays. We arrived for dinner on a Friday night at 6:15 and were seated immediately.For anyone who's never tried soba before, I recommend the classic zaru soba to start off. It's a plate of plain buckwheat noodles and a special dipping sauce.I ordered the cold Tororo soba this time. It comes in a bowl like the warm ones. For the topping, there is shredded dry seaweed and mountain yam that has been boiled and puréed into a fine paste. Once the dipping sauce is added, the yam creates a unique thickness to the soba noodles which I absolutely loved.For dessert, I decided to try the Strawberry Anmitsu since I've been on a Anmitsu hunt in NYC. I was very impressed with what Sobaya had. The treat is basically a glass of water jellies topped with sweet red bean paste, sweetened strawberries, green tea of black sesame ice cream, mint leaves, and sugar syrup. The water jellies are flavorless, and the ice cream (both flavors) is very lightly sweetened, so the whole dessert balances out.
Jenn C.}Manhattan, NY}419}185}322}18}3}9/18/2015}Good but pricey for the amount of food that you get.You can get a small, regular or large. I got the regular with a sardine and mitsuba leaf tempura and at first, it looks huge. But, it is pretty shallow and not that filling. With the cold soba, they give you hot water to pour into your dipping broth after you are finished with your noodles. My friend got the Japanese yam soba. It was different from mine because it was viscous and gooey. I didn't really enjoy it but she liked the texture.The dessert was really good: anmitsu with sesame ice cream.
Dominique N.}Manhattan, NY}515}19}31}-1}4}9/15/2015}Weekdays, weekends, lunch, dinner: Soba-ya. When people come from out of town and they're looking for a light meal: Soba-ya. When it's late, but you still want a nice sit-down establishment: Soba-ya. When your friends want Japanese, but no one can agree where to go: Soba-ya. When the wait at Ootaya is too long: Soba-ya. Yep.
Michelle K.}Chino Hills, CA}307}98}39}-1}4}9/11/2015}Japanese food is one of my favorite cuisines, so when my friend suggested Soba-ya, of course I was SUPER STOKED. We went for dinner and it was kind of busy so we couldn't sit at a table, so instead we sat at the bar.For appetizer, we ordered mixed tempura to share, YUUUUM. For my entree, I got the cold soba noodles with the fried chicken and garlic in hot dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was way toooo salty so I had to water it down alot. The "fried chicken" was not so fried anymore... it got sooooooo soggy in the dipping sauce which I did not really enjoy. However, the noodles were cooked just the way I like it and the regular size was the perfect portion. My friends both got the duck dipping sauce and it was sooo much better. Service-wise, the bartender was very friendly by often refilling the hot water and iced water for us.
Tunyaluck P.}Troy, NY}117}209}947}18}5}9/11/2015}This place never gets old for me. I can go for their Lunch any day. Too bad I now live very far from.
Nelson W.}New York, NY}151}5}60}-1}1}9/10/2015}I just had THE WORST dining experience in my life at this place. This review is specifically for the manager or owner or whoever the guy who's bossing around is.This is the second time I've been to this place. Their soba is not the best I've had but it's good enough for me to go back. But the attitude of their manager is rude and totally unacceptable.I arrived here at 6pm on a Thursday night. Upon arrival, I asked the waitress if I could get seated in one of the booths while I wait for my friends, who I told her would be there in 5-10 minutes. The waitress said yes. When she was about to lead me to my table, the manager stopped us and said my whole party needed to be there to sit in their booths. At that time, there were only 5 customers in the restaurant and 90% of the restaurant was vacant. My immediate thought was "wow, seriously?!" but of course I waited for my friends to arrive after 5 mins and we ended up getting a booth anyway.At the end of the meal, my friends and I decided to give only 10% tip because of the way the manager treated us. The manager took the bill, then returned and demanded us to tip more. We explained to him why we didn't tip them any more than we did. He then went on to THREATEN us to either increase our tip or never come back anymore! We were all very shocked as I have NEVER been treated like this in a restaurant.I normally tip around 15-20% for a good service and at least 10% for a bad service. I understand servers have a low hourly rate but I also believe tips need to be earned. There's a reason tipping is not mandatory because customers get to choose how much to tip based on the kind of service they receive. The way I see it, if you get a small tip, you need to find out why and make improvements instead of threatening your customers to either tip more or never come again.Needless to say, I'm never coming back to this place again!
Christopher W.}Baltimore, MD}209}144}21}-1}5}9/9/2015}I have only ever been here for lunch.  However, whenever I come it is always for the set lunch specials and they never fail to impress.Combining real Soba with sake or a nice japanese imported beer is just a little bit of heaven on earth.I would highly recommend this place to any new Soba eaters and veteran eaters alike.BTW the lunch specials or soba combinations are the best bang for the buck.
Thalie L.}Chicago, IL}90}295}310}18}5}9/8/2015}This place is just amazingThere is so much foodI would recommend to take only one plate and small portion is enoughI was scared to not have enough food and order way more than i could eatfood is delicious!!! will come back again. yummy
K L.}New York, NY}50}20}22}-1}4}9/7/2015}I got there Saturday around 8 and the wait was about 30 mins so we went to the bar across the street to get some drinks. I got the duck and it was pretty good. I tried both the cold and hot noodle and I prefer the hot.
Alice W.}Fairfax, VA}486}721}2088}18}4}9/6/2015}No frills. Just comforting. That's Soba-ya's slogan and it's truth. We were in the mood for some soba after a night of izakaya and cocktails. We ordered the uni soba (cold) and the Kamonan soba (hot). The uni was so fresh it tasted like it just came from the ocean. The sauteed duck in the Kamonan soba was also very good. At the end of our meal, the server brought over the soba-yu (the warm water that boiled soba). This is so we could drink the dipping sauce (soba tsuyu) mixed with the soba-yu to enjoy the flavor of soba. Noodles are made in house and fresh. Good, simple, comfort food. If you're in the mood for soba, this is definitely the place to go.
Hana S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}371}537}169}18}4}9/5/2015}Growing up in Tokyo means soba noodles have a deep spot in my heart and this place definitely meets my expectations!Their lunch is great! If you get here early enough you can get one of the 25 bento boxes which have seasonal stuff in it and comes with a small tempura dish + soba noodles. It ends with a cute little dessert.Remember to ask for the soba-yu at the end of your meal so you can drink the soba tsuyu :d it's really good! Their one flaw is that they rush you because they get very busy, and that's not always the best feeling :/
Tiffany T.}Los Angeles, CA}117}203}10}-1}4}8/26/2015}I crave soba on hot summer days so I headed to soba-ya on an evening mid-August.Ordered the uni soba and duck soba w/ hot dipping sauce. Both were delish! The uni soba came w/ grated mountain yam, which I don't normally like but in this case, it was a perfect combo in w/ the uni and soba sauce. It adds a texture and heartiness to the dish that I enjoyed. The duck soba was also very tasty! It was bit heavier w/ the savory dipping sauce- not bad at all. We also ordered the mushroom tempura which was very fried and not very mushroom; and braised pork with egg- which I highly recommend.Overall, the food here is good quality and worth the price. I recommend sticking to the cold soba options since those noodles have the best texture. Also get the pork belly app-nomz!
Connie Z.}Rego Park, NY}55}21}1}-1}4}8/23/2015}Been here with a group of friends. It's a small place so reservations are definitely recommended. The soup tasted amazing. One of the best soba I've had!
Connie L.}New York, NY}30}329}136}18}2}8/23/2015}More like Soba-noLooks promising but don't do it. The outside looks authentic and so does the inside. But when you look around, something looks off. The people working here aren't Japanese. The guy pulling the soba noodles wasn't even Japanese. This normally wouldn't be a big deal if the food was good. But it wasn't.The soba lacked the fresh taste and the broth was lacking depth and flavor. Then my sister's duck soba was wayyy too salty. The portions were bigger than expected, i got a medium, but a small would be fine actually. After paying our bill, we realized we didn't get the hot water that the soba was cooked in, the one where a lot of nutrients are, to finish our meal. They were too busy to rush us out for the next unfortunate soul to eat here.If you want ambiance, sure come here. If you want good food, go somewhere else.
Michelle C.}Fairfax, VA}0}23}1}-1}5}8/20/2015}Soba noodles are so yummy. It has the perfect texture! The dipping broth is flavorful.
Linda T.}San Francisco, CA}286}1575}2}18}4}8/20/2015}Lunch set such a great deal!  Hot/cold soba with mini don.  I opted for the una-ju (eel rice bowl) with cold soba.  Texture of soba was magnificent.  Unlike most mushy or soft soba I've had, this was al dente with a slight chew to it.  Heard the tempuras are the must get here.. I didn't have a chance to try any, but a friend got the vege tempura hot soba lunch set and finished every piece of it. Service was very slow and seems confused in a tight table setting.
Hong L.}Brooklyn, NY}304}612}191}18}3}8/19/2015}We were in a mood to slurp noodles for dinner. Yes, we could have gone with the ramen or the italian spaghetti... But it was the really idea of slurping cold soba noodles in a tasty dipping sauce, on a hot summer day, that won us over. We ordered :- Black Cod Fish - The fish was so flaky and had decent flavoring but I thought the flavor wasn't really infused into the fish.- Zaru Cold Noodles (Mori with Nori Seaweed) - You can't go wrong with this.- Mixed Seafood Tempura - A good amount of Fish and vegetablesThe food was decent if not borderline good . What was annoying was that the food was brought out one at a time and the soba noodles took so long that we were done with the rest of our food and just waiting for our soba noodles in the end. When it came out, we inhaled it. We would have loved to eat it along with the fish or the tempura but didn't want to get the food cold. In the end of the meal, they give you a broth to pour into your sauce. You end up drinking the sauce like a soup to finish off your meal.
Amy Z.}Queens, NY}793}112}210}-1}4}8/17/2015}**3.5 stars**Had this place bookmarked on yelp for ages and i finally got to try it this past weekend! Came for lunch at around 130 and ended up waiting 30 minutes for a table which isn't too bad! I saw plenty of reviews about their mini-lunch set which seems to come with a generous portion for $14. I even went on their website to see the menu and the prices were also around $14, however, when i looked at the menu, the mini-lunch sets were around $17-18. I'm not sure if the price is different on the weekends or if they recently changed the price but that kinda threw me off cause $4 makes a difference!! They should definitely make a note on their website!Even so, in the end I ended up getting the Chicken Katsu Don Set which is Deep Fried Chicken Omelette over Rice and it comes with hot/cold soba noodles. The set definitely isnt mini as many reviews have mentioned! The Chicken katsu was realllyyy good!! They didnt skimp out on the chicken and gave a really generous amount with the bowl. There was a lot of flavor with it, no compaints there. The soba was good and came with a small bowl of dipping sauce. You get a small dish of scallions and wasabi on the side to add to your dipping sauce. The sauce was okay, nothing memorable. I also got the Sake Oyako Don  Sliced Salmon Sashimi And Salmon Roe Over Rice (mini) on the side cause a lot of the reviews raved about this dish! However, i didn't feel this dish was really that special. The salmon and roe was good but nothing impressive and the bowl was mainly rice. I didn't feel it was worth the $12. At the end of your meal, youre given some broth that you can pour into the rest of your soba dipping sauce to drink. I personally didn't like it as it tasted too much like watered down soy sauce but maybe my ratio was off? iDK. but i didnt like it LOL one sip was more than enough.The service was okay, I had to ask for water a couple of times for water but they were busy so i'll cut them some slack
Joey L.}New York, NY}131}269}484}18}2}8/13/2015}I was so excited to try out this place since they made their soba in house. We got here around 7:20 and it didn't seem too busy, but the hostess said there would be a 30 min wait. We came back around 7:45 and they said they were still waiting on a table for us. We finally get seated around 8:15. At least we were entertained by the man making the soba. My sister and her friend got the hot soba and I got a cold soba. Unfortunately none of the soba lived up to our expectations. It didn't have that fresh "just made" taste to it. This tasted like the dried noodles I could buy at the Asian mart. Then the soup... I got the duck and it had a texture I wasn't expecting. It reminded me more of beef than duck. I normally like salty food, but this was waaay too salty for me. I just finished the duck and used the soup to warm up my noodles. We also realized we were gypped at the end. They were supposed to give you a small pot of hot water so you could finish your soup. We saw all the other tables had it.Service was slow and our water never got refilled. Like another reviewer said, go to cocoron for your soba fix.
Peter Y.}Brooklyn, NY}618}636}415}-1}3}8/13/2015}Wow, this may be the first time Yelp has let me down in turns of expectations. I usually take reviews with a grain of salt, but seeing the high number of 4/5 stars for this place, I said why not, and came here last night with a friend.When we got here, we were quoted a 30 minute wait time by their friendly hostess, so we went to Snowdays for some pre-dinner dessert (I do what I want). Once back, we were seated pretty much immediately. The interior of this place is very clean, with polished wooden tables set in either seatings of 2 or 4. I went with their regular Kamo Seiro (Sauteed duck & cold soba - $17.75) while my friend got their regular Stamina Seior (Fried chicken & cold soba - $16).  Given how jam packed this place was, the service was pretty good (sure, the water could have been refilled a little faster, but I'll cut them some slack for that). Anyways, everything was going fine until our food arrived. Our soba sets arrived on a tray carrying the hot dipping sauce (with your choice of add-on/protein), a bowl of green onions and your cold soba noodles. The noodles were presented on a square wooden box (think big bento box), and while appearing substantial at first, turned out to be a paltry amount. It first looked like the entire box was filled with noodles, but at a second glance, you'll notice that the noodles are actually resting on a bamboo screen. There were just enough noodles to barely cover the surface of the screen, and if each strand were to be connected into one long piece, you can probably slurp it up in 10-20 seconds. Now I don't know about you guys, but that's definitely not enough food for a grown adult (or even a grown teen).  Anyways, moving on. The soba noodles were extremely bland by themselves (I get that the point is to dip it in your dipping sauce), but an additional garnish (crushed garlic, sesame oil, etc...) would have gone a long way to enhance the meal. The dipping sauce, on the other hand, was hearty - if not a bit too heavy.Then we have their sauteed "duck". A well crafted duck is among my favorite foods on the planet; and duck confit is usually my go-to order at "fancy" restaurants to use as a measuring stick. I don't know how their duck was made, but it was devoid of all flavors that made it duck (namely the gamey flavor I'm used to) , which is kind of the whole point in ordering duck in the first place... In fact, if this was a blind taste test, I would have guessed chicken or pork over duck 100% of the time. And my friend's fried chicken was no better, as the fried crust turned out extremely soggy. We ended up paying $22 each with tax and tip, which while not too bad (this IS Manhattan that we're talking about), just didn't make sense for the amount and quality of food we received. tl;dr - service and atmosphere on point, but food was lacking in amount, and consisted of indecipherable meat.
Stephanie P.}Chelsea, Manhattan, NY}0}6}6}-1}2}8/9/2015}My sister ordered udon. But taste so bad cause the dish has strong "burn" taste kind of bitter and i ask what s going on thet said that was ok. But actually it s not ok. And also i ordered soba. Its also soso not really good. Just ok.
Miyabi J.}Norman, OK}2}6}40}-1}2}8/6/2015}The food is just ok, but I barely receive service, no one refill my drinks, and I got a wrong order, my waiter refuse to change it. That was an unhappy dinning experience. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to watch the chef marketing soba. I have to say, the place is really decorate Japanese style and beautiful. But if the food and service is not good enough, it cannot call a good restaurant.
Sophie P.}Boston, MA}980}404}1649}18}5}8/6/2015}COME HERE FOR LUNCH!This restaurant has nicely spaced tables, a clean interior, and an amazing bathroom! (I loved the bidet). + LUNCH SET // SAKE OYAKO DON & COLD SOBAThis is the best lunch deal. For $14, I shared this set with my boyfriend and got another don and was completely stuffed. Although the sake oyako don was "mini", it was great to try both the salmon sashimi and salmon roe. The salmon was very fresh and the roe was refreshing against the bed of rice. The soba was not salty and the cold noodles were amazing on a hot summer day!+ TUNA STEAK DON:The entree size of don is $11, which is only $3 cheaper than the combo. They definitely give you more rice, teriyaki sauce, and tuna with the entree size, but I thought the lunch set was a much better deal. The tuna was seared perfectly with teriyaki sauce drizzled over rice that made it impossible not to slurp it all up.The service was friendly, efficient, and always refilled our waters! I will definitely come back here.
Fisher Z.}New York, NY}226}5}3}-1}3}8/3/2015}I came here to explore the soba. The food was okay. I liked my Uni Soba but my friends did really enjoy their orders. It was a personal preference. Someone may like it somone may not. It pissed me off when it came to birthday cake. We brought a birthday cake and gave to the waitress when we arrived. After our meal, when we unwrapped the cake the waitress said 'no outside food is allowed'. Are you serious? This is the only place that does not allow birthday cake even with extra charge.
Annie P.}Nashville, TN}56}188}29}-1}4}7/30/2015}I went here last night with a couple of my friends. The wait wasn't too long. Ten minutes maximum. While you wait, there is a man making soba noodles from scratch "on display", so that was fun to watch. When we got settled in, we ordered an appetizer of squid with sticky rice. I have never had such a thing but it was pretty good!! I ordered the basic soba with nori and fish cakes. It was good. Not out of this world but good. The portion was smaller than I thought but still satisfactory. The service was okay as well. I would come back!
Gillian C.}Los Angeles, CA}7}83}1}-1}3}7/27/2015}Made the mistake of coming here during peak dinner time on a Saturday. We waited about 50 mins - 1 hour before getting seated. While it's fun to watch the soba noodles being made, it doesn't entirely make up for the long wait. I went in thinking I'd love to eat some cold soba after a hot day in the sun, but I waited so long that I felt cold and wound up getting the hot tempura soba. I was pleasantly surprised that it came with 3 shrimp (I expected only 2), but at $20 for the regular size, it's still pretty expensive for what you get. The soba is tasty, but the hot soup / sauce was wayyy too salty for me to drink. I appreciated the cleanliness of the bathroom I used, but I heard that the other one was a mess. I suspect that its location by the door allows non-customers to more easily slip past the host and use the bathroom, especially when the waiting area is crowded. We saw someone make a beeline for the bathroom and then quickly leave after apparently shooting up in there.
Sanna C.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}134}30}1}-1}2}7/22/2015}Save your money and go to Cocoron instead. The portion here was small for the price, and not satisfying. The broth was way too salty even for dipping. My friend and I agreed that it was overpriced and not nearly as amazing as we hoped it was. Service was slow. Perhaps because it was busy, but I found myself waiting far too long for someone to refill my water to quench the thirst from the salty broth.
Al L.}Toronto, Canada}980}856}970}-1}4}7/19/2015}The soba is cooked al dente and has a good chew. For some, it may be a bit too chewey, but for me, I like the texture. Got the lunch combo that came with a tuna bowl with rice. Both the soba and the tuna bowl were very good. Got seated very quickly on a random weekday afternoon and the hostess and server were both very nice. Tho I don't think anyone I saw working there was japanese, for what whatever its worth.
SeungAh Y.}Jersey City, NJ}4}5}2}-1}2}7/18/2015}taste is just okay not that good not that bad price is not reasonable just okay restaurantsoba noodle is not good
Kai Xin C.}Brooklyn, NY}1}6}1}-1}5}7/16/2015}Have been here several times for both lunch and dinner. They have a really yummy broth for their hot noodles. I frequently get the hot duck soba, and the duck gives the broth an extra kick of umami flavor. I would also recommend their tempura and sashimi starters.
Juliana O.}New York, NY}2}153}24}-1}3}7/14/2015}FYI: it's a soba place! Please order soba! Don't be like me ordering udon! I regret every second coming here to not reading some reviews.. Arreggghhhhh!!!!Their cawanmushi is not good at all.
Shiho K.}ASTORIA, NY}10}43}167}-1}4}7/9/2015}It is the best soba restaurant in NY. I love Tempura, but Tempura is also great here. You should try soba with many toppings. I like Tororo, deep fried garic, tenkasu, Tempura. However, be carefull there is always busy.
Lorelei Y.}New York, NY}269}310}132}18}5}7/7/2015}I was here for lunch with friends last week, and it was top-notch! The lunch box is a HUGE amount of food, and the price is very reasonable. The cold teas were refreshing and perfect for a hot, sunny day, and the service was quick and efficient. We did have to wait about 35 minutes for a table, but that wasn't too bad considering the very small number of tables here. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic Japanese food experience at a reasonable price point!
Kiyo O.}Los Angeles, CA}58}137}48}-1}4}7/4/2015}great lunch prices for New York City. one of the my go to spots in the east village. can definitely get busy at peak meal times
Ji P.}Manhattan, NY}183}86}0}-1}3}6/26/2015}I can see that the chef is putting a lot of efforts into the soba. Maybe it's just me not that into the form of Soba.
Linda C.}Manhattan, NY}2}72}1}-1}5}6/24/2015}Been here twice before, once for dinner and once for lunch and although dinner was good, their lunch box is really good. comes with shrimp  and peper tempura, choice of cold or hot soba, a salad, cooked marinated salmon, and rice with fish roe on top. After the meal, there were little dessert custards (really tasty) that came along with the lunch box. I usually get ice cold water, but you should get the hot tea (which is really good - has a roasted rice taste to is) as well. The place is nice and clean. I will definitely be back for more lunches.
Wahed K.}Astoria, NY}651}734}1505}18}4}6/23/2015}I've been to Soba Ya a couple of times. I like coming here for lunch, sitting in a quiet corner and enjoying a bowl of soba noodles. It's one of life's simple pleasures. If you are hungry, I would go with one of the lunch bento boxes. When I come here I'm usually just here for the soba and nothing else so I'll just get a Tanuki bowl. I love the tempura bits. However they do get soggy if you keep them on the bowl for too long so I always find myself wolfing down my noodles - which is something you should be doing with these noodles anyway. The broth tastes clean and light - I think they do a good a job with the dashi . The noodles are 80% buckwheat and 20% wheat flour.  I like their texture and taste. They always satisfy my soba craving.I think this is a place where one can learn to appreciate soba. I've been to Soba Koh, Soba Totto and Cocoron and I think they each offer their own charm. Soba ya is much simpler but it's been around a long time. I believe it's owned by the same folks behind Sakagura and Sake Bar Decibel.
Alan T.}Queens, NY}145}40}15}-1}4}6/22/2015}I'm a big fan of this place. I love coming here in the summer time and getting an uni soba or a ikura soba. Its extremely refreshing and the amount of ikura/uni they give is very generous. My GF also loves the Kamo Namban, which comes with a hot dipping sauce and duck.
Christina N.}Glen Oaks, NY}505}186}134}-1}3}6/21/2015}I have to say this place has authentic Japanese food. I ordered the soba noodles and salmon on the side. The soba can be a little bland but I added the sauce and the salmon was delicious.
Joo J.}Queens, NY}16}30}1}-1}5}6/21/2015}You are very lucky if you are a woman because you get cool toilet with a bidet. Their soba is cool too. I don't want to compare their delicious food to their bathroom, but damn-- what a nice bathroom.Oh ya their soba: perfectly cooked. Their broth was rich and at first seemed too little but was the right enough and more for our meal. I really liked the soup they give to dilute your soba broth. Really refreshing and cleansing even though it was pretty rich. Great service, our server was very attentive. So yea girls check out the toilet. Guys: haha
Ellie H.}Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA}10}61}162}-1}5}6/20/2015}If you are a soba noodle and matcha ice cream fans, it will be a great place for you. The Animitsu is a must try for dessert!!!! Best green tea ice cream in town. It might be a little bitter, as it add lots of matcha powder in it. But it tastes sooooooo matcha and soooooooo good!
Julie C.}New York, NY}1}13}6}-1}5}6/18/2015}Such a cute place located near St. Marks. (its across the street from Solas)Came here on a Friday night with the boyfriend. There was a 30 min wait for a table, which wasn't bad at all! I ordered the regular plain cold soba with dipping sauce with a sides of uni, sauteed duck and tofu. My boyfriend ordered the Ten Zaru (shrimp, shiso, shisito tempura) Everything was assembled on this cute tray when they brought it out. My soba was light and delicious, uni was fresh and creamy, tofu was just plain firm tofu. It didn't really taste like anything. The only thing I'll skip in the future is the duck. It was dried and flavorless. But overall my tray of food was great. My boyfriend seemed to like his order too because he wolfed that sucker down or maybe the poor guy was just hungry. hahah. For dessert, we got the anmitsu to share. It was almost too pretty to dig in. Its a must try item! You won't regret it.
Ann M.}Gainesville, FL}31}37}4}-1}5}6/18/2015}I don't know a lot about udon, but I got the Age Tofu udon with yuzu and loved it. The broth was just amazing, the tofu was perfectly spicy and crisp, the serving was generous, the service (at bar) attentive but not intrusive. I got sake and liked it ok, but I don't like sake do don't take my word. Highly recommended!
Ami P.}Los Angeles, CA}344}695}1768}-1}4}6/17/2015Updatedreview}My second time here but first time for dinner! I definitely want to try the dinner combo next time! I got the mushroom soba and it was refreshing and delicious and my friend got the duck soba! We didn't know the portions were going to be a bit small do we are gonna opt for the large next time! Great service, excited to come back!
Neil O.}Astoria, Queens, NY}0}4}0}-1}2}6/13/2015}It is absolutely overpriced food. I know japanese food very well. Sobaya is so overrated place. When I got water glass, there was fragments of a glass which was very critically dangerous. We ordered sake don which is salmon and its roe over rice. Rice was so sticky like rice cake. Inside flesh of salmon, there was still very sharp fish bone. When it comes to udon, it is totally disgusting. I dont want to mention that noodle. It was the worst noodle and overpriced. I will never go again. I think it deserves three stars.
Dennis C.}Los Angeles, CA}240}43}107}-1}4}6/10/2015}It was delicious and good bang for the buck. I got the mini box, which came with vegetables, small appetizers, chicken katsu over rice, and soba noodles with dipping sauce with turns into soup with complementary broth. There's a place right next door that is essentially the same but double the price.
Lindsay J.}Manhattan, NY}0}24}0}-1}4}6/9/2015}This place smells like Japan! Everything is quite authentic and quality of food was very good. While it didn't taste like soba that I've had in Japan, it certainly came quite close. We went on Monday evening around 6:30 PM and were seated quickly. However a line started forming shortly after we sat down so it's definitely a place that you want to come early to.We looked through the menu and there were so many choices. Not knowing what to get all three of us ended up getting the early bird dinner special that includes assorted vegetables as appetizer, shrimp and vegetable tempura, cold soba (you could get hot/cold soba/udon), and vanilla ice cream with strawberry syrup. The appetizers were unique and interesting, and again reminded me of Japan. The lotus was kind of salty but still good. Everything was refreshing and definitely served the purpose of being an appetizer. Noodles were really good and tasted fresh, the dipping sauce was delicious, and tempura was made really well (very crispy even after sitting out for a while). I was most happy about the inari that came with the entree too since it's one of my favorites :) Service at this place is very quick and they were always coming to take away dishes very quickly. The dessert wasn't that exciting, just standard vanilla ice cream - quality was lower than I expected as there were ice crystals inside the ice cream (my friend for some reason thought it was peanuts?? no it was ice). Will update review when I come back for one of the other soba dishes, but definitely a great and fun place to try!
Gerrod W.}New York, NY}19}32}89}-1}5}6/8/2015}I always feel unsure giving a place 5 stars after only one visit but I feel like soba-ya would not disappoint. The 3 of us got their early on a Sunday, pretty much right when it opened and I would say within an hour or so the place was filled and people were already waiting for a table. So unless you want an early dinner be prepared to have to wait.I'm not a soba expert in any way shape or form but the mori was amazing. As someone who has eaten ramen all his life and has read about ramen and more or less immersed himself in the culture of it, I feel this is exactly what really good soba would be like. The menu can be a little daunting given how big it is but I guess you kinda just have to go in there with a game plan. The rest of our dinner ranged from fried chicken to sauteed duck to  mushroom tempura, which btw I'm I fell in love with and would go back just for that. Service was prompt and super friendly. Don't be thrown off when the waitress keeps an eye on your glass and makes sure she keeps it topped off. She's not being pushy she's just doing her job in a Soba shop. Between 3 people, apps, noodles and beer. Came to about 120 sans tip.
Vincent D.}Valley Stream, NY}15}68}88}-1}5}6/7/2015}Great place for authentic Japanese soba noodles. The noodles are fresh made. You can choose cold or hot soba/udon noodle bowls with a variety of mixtures from tempura, chicken, shrimp, vegetables, etc. I got the regular size bowl and it was a lot of noodles. Get the small bowl and start off with some appetizers.
Etienne M.}Harlem, Manhattan, NY}0}34}0}-1}5}6/6/2015}Delicious udonAlmost felt like I was back in KyotoSuper nice waitersNice restaurant
Patrick Y.}Los Angeles, CA}185}101}10}-1}5}6/6/2015}Soba is delicious, and Soba-ya is amazing. They have so many different toppings. The lunch specials are killer. Katsudon + soba set is love. Their green tea ice cream is THE BOMB. It's totally different from store bought--darker in color, less sweet, and much more concentrated matcha flavor.The quality is great. Just don't come expecting salmon and appetizers as good as Sakagura.
Diana C.}Mount Laurel, NJ}27}34}16}-1}5}6/6/2015}I have tried many Japanese places before, but this place is amazing! You can taste that noodles are hand made and portion size is pretty reasonable for Japanese food. Great service and food!.
Linna F.}New York, NY}30}348}52}18}4}6/5/2015}Decent, I would give it 3.5 stars overall. Service was fast and courteous. We were seated in no time on a Thursday evening at 7pm. We got the large tempura appetizer (yum) and the Kamo Nanban (hot soba sauteed duck & tokyo negi (green onion)), Curry Nanban, and Una-Ju (broiled eel rice bowl). We also ordered the mochi ice cream and Sobaya Manju (100% Buckwheat little dessert bun with red bean filling and a scoop of green tea ice cream).  I really liked the Una-Ju, my fiance and I thought the hot soba noodle bowls were OK.  Maybe we were not used to the flavor, I don't know.  Maybe I should have tried the cold soba noodles, not sure.  Either way, it was a nice dining experience for 3 people - though expensive! This came out to about ~$110 with a nice tip.
Fazeela S.}Brooklyn, NY}190}323}348}-1}5}6/5/2015}Soba-Ya is incredible. So is the toilet in the women's bathroom (there is a seat warmer and an electronic bidet with jets that come from the front and back...)!! It is a Japanese "Toto Washer". Google it. We are clearly doing the whole toilet thing wrong in the US. Do you ever just crave a big steaming bowl of Japanese noodles with complex flavors? I did (and I had a cold) and I hit the jackpot with Soba-Ya. The major bonus was that they had really great options for pescatarians like me. One glance of the menu makes you realize that you are actually eating Japanese food (many of my Japanese friends indicate that sushi is even a delicacy in Japan - it is not common to eat it everyday and Japanese menus are not usually chock full o sushi).We ordered the agadashi tofu, which was served with hot broth (soothing and perfectly crisp edges) and the tuna tartar to start. Both were fresh and really tasty. But they were really just the opening act to the specialty of the house, the noodles. S-Y specializes in Buckwheat noodles (Read: Healthier than Udon and other varieties). Their Buckwheat is the sarashina variety (they only use the finest part of the grain, which makes it refined and gives it a subtle aroma).  I ordered the Kinoko hot noodle soup which is made with shimeji, enoki and shitake mushrooms. I ordered it with Udon noodles - because that is what I was craving that day and ... WOW - they figured out how to make a vegetarian soup and broth nuanced and complex (Dear Ippudo: Take notes). The soup was cozy, layered, filling, WOODSY. A home run. My spouse ordered one of the hot noodle soup specials with chicken, I think it had curry, and he STILL talks about it. He also described it as woodsy and completely layered, flavorful and unique. He had never tried anything like it. They have various toppings that you can add to any soup (they are around .50 cents to $3.00 and range from an egg with loose yolk, seaweed flakes, etc...). He ordered the spinach, egg and some sort of flake to top his. I can't wait to go back... and i may bring a magazine just so I can sit on that Toto Washer and really enjoy it.
Bethany W.}Ithaca, NY}174}68}31}-1}4}6/5/2015}I love this place. Classic soba, you can get it hot or cold. I come here with my family or even for dates. The atmosphere is classic for a Japanese restaurant. I wish I took pictures of my food. Presentation was nice. May be difficult to get a table sometimes for dinner so come early, there may be a wait. But it's worth it!
Daryl T.}Brooklyn, NY}150}34}42}-1}4}6/3/2015}The staff was friendly. Food was on point. Since it was a hot day didn't want a hot dish so instead I got the cold soba! It was so tasty. I got the salmon roe with taro. It was too salty with the sauce but once you add the water to it, compliments it very well. Definately would go back!
Hailey K.}Bay Ridge, NY}120}4}550}-1}5}5/29/2015}Highly recommend this place. The staff was super duper friendly, the food was excellent and everything was just clean and nice.(even the bathroom!) I got tuna steak don and cold soba for lunch mini set, and it was really satisfying.
Monique C.}New York, NY}925}112}1954}-1}4}5/28/2015}Walked in with my friend and my mom for dinner last night. We had good experience at soba ya. I have food allergy for MSG and chicken powder. Confirmed with waiters and the chef doesn't use those ingredients.  Cool. Reading the menu, the first thing popped up in my eyes was cool soba with uni. Unfortunately all the uni items were sold out last night. Never mind. I changed order to a large cold soba with roe along with appetizers to share : tofu salad, mixed large tempura ( small portion $9 for two shrimp tempuras. Large $17 for three tempuras and more veggies). Tuna Yuba Maki ( thin sliced tuna wrapped with tofu skin over avocado ) was divine. My cold roe soba with some seaweed, green onion, and wasabi was delicious!!!! The portion is big, non of us finished our soba. Eyes bigger than our stomachs is not necessary a bad thing. However next time I will try to tell myself small is enough.
Eric H.}Brooklyn, NY}59}32}13}-1}3}5/27/2015}The noodles were well made and the broth was delicious. The service was lacking and inattentive. They checked in at really long intervals or not at all. The appetizers were brought out at the same time as the noodles. (What's the point of even ordering them if they're just going to get ignored for the noodles?) The whole experience wasn't worth the price tag. You're a big boy restaurant in Manhattan so get your shit together.
Helen Z.}Acton, MA}0}46}0}-1}5}5/25/2015}The cold soba noodles with duck are delicious! I have yet to try a soba dish here that wasn't good. It is definitely pricey, but they make their own noodles so I guess it's fair. A 'large' is actually pretty small...
Tiffany E.}Hong Kong}520}345}1029}-1}4}5/18/2015}Only choices of noodles here are udon and soba. You can get hot/cold soba--both of which are good but the hot one is saltier. I recommend getting one of their lunch sets because it comes with a lot of food for a good price. My cousin got the lunch set with cold soba and eel while I got the hot soba and oyakodon. Both were equally yummy and filling. The only downside is that service is really slow and the food takes a while. Our waiter was also really hard to get a hold of too and we felt pressured to order quickly. There wasn't even a line of people so I was confused.
Sharon W.}Jackson Heights, NY}18}120}260}-1}5}5/18/2015}The food here is impeccable!  I loved every bit of it, except for the uni soba dish. The uni of course, without a doubt very tasty. The texture of the dish was what I wasn't fond of, it had a slimy texture - which almost looked like phlegm. My soup dish with the fresh soba was awesome! It tastes like a spy sauce soup base that wasn't too salty. Our waitress was of course great as We'll! I would love to go back to try another one of their soba dishes.
Lily M.}Manhattan, NY}61}37}7}-1}5}5/15/2015}One of our favorite Japanese joint in east village, and my favorite soba/udon place on Manhattan. Must to try are the black cod with citrus sauce,  curry udon and tempera.
Leo P.}South Pasadena, CA}0}15}0}-1}3}5/15/2015}My hot soba was ok, had a bit of a hunky aftertaste due to the amount of oil. Started the meal with squid stuffed with sticky rice. I ordered the soba with tempera and the tempera was one of the best I've ever had. Flaky and cooked to perfection, shrimp, shishito peppers, it was great. Interior is quite pleasant and creates a nice atmosphere for dining.
Gabby S.}Brooklyn, NY}437}207}92}18}5}5/14/2015}This place is awesome! Pricy yes but definitely still awesome. They also have different specials on different days. I was there on Wednesday and it was 50% off on desserts so me and my friend got 3 LOL The green tea creme brûlée  was super good  and I don't recall the name but there was a buckwheat bun with red bean paste. We also had the milk pudding with strawberry I wasn't a big fan but my friend really enjoyed it .For entrees with got a salmon tartar to share it was really good it was mini size but it looked pretty big.I had the tuna steak set it was good the soba and dipping sauce were awesome and the tuna was super yummy.My friend has salmon lunch set and it was great can never go wrong with salmon. Def recommend this place opened my eyes and helped me develop love for soba :D
Jeannie C.}Columbus, OH}57}55}0}-1}4}5/12/2015}Consistently good food at fair prices. We feasted like kings and was very satisfied with our meal. Service was a little rushed, as the restaurant was very busy, but beside that, I really enjoyed this restaurant.
Teasy S.}New York, NY}25}32}299}-1}5}5/6/2015Updatedreview}Came here for the second time. Awesome dining experience as last time.I ordered the toro cold udon which I didn't really know what is inside. It's a little bit sticky like natto. Personally I like it cuz I'm a fan of natto. It tastes healthy. The udon noodle itself is not like usual. It's thinner but even more chewy. Tamago is also nice. They offered two kinds of soy sauce and both are good. But I actually prefer eating it directly without anything else.It's so impressive that all the desserts are half price on Wednesday. The manju with green tea icecream is absolutely a must try if you are a red bean person. They also have honey wasabi icecream which sounds weird but is uniquely good! Love it.BTW, the waiter was helpful :)
Charlotte S.}Brooklyn, NY}8}12}1}-1}5}5/3/2015}My absolute FAVORITE lunch spot..the most addicting udon/soba broth and will keep you coming back for more. Amazing lunch specials with numerous options (my favorite being sashimi salmon with hot udon) you will not leave hungry & will not be disappointed
Caroline S.}Los Angeles, CA}451}49}54}-1}4}5/2/2015}Grilled Salmon - YUUUMOyakodonn - GOODCurry Donkatsu - MEHSoba - YESSSSSSSSo fresh. Tempura is crispy and on point. Perfect for a quiet lunch.
Jasmine C.}Brooklyn, NY}131}198}279}-1}4}4/29/2015}Right when you walk in, you're able to see the soba noodles being made. Customer service was good, didn't had a problem placing our order or anything. The food came pretty quickly too. I got the Sake Oyako Don Lunch Set: Salmon Roe & Sashimi over Rice  ($14) and I have to say it's not small at all. It comes with 5 small little appetizers/snacks, they all taste pretty good. The salmon roe and sashimi was good, pretty fresh. The rice wasn't special or anything. I got the cold soba with the set and it was pretty good, it was very chewy and fresh.
Van V.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}3}4/28/2015}I have been going to Sobaya for over 8 years and adore it.  Yesterday, was the first time I had a bad experience.  I experienced really bad food poisoning.  I was shocked at first, but after searching the reviews, I see that a few others experienced food poisoning this year as well.  I ordered a plain hot soba entree with a mini side of tempura, their cold vegetable appetizer, and a yuba sashimi appetizer.  Once I ate the vegetables, my stomach began to churn.  Within an hour I was running to the bathroom vomiting.  And it happened over and over again throughout the night.   I wonder if they were just sloppy with how they handled their good.  Think I will take a break for awhile, at least until I the reports of food poisoning subside.
Jm H.}Jersey City, NJ}46}62}8}-1}4}4/27/2015}good for a quick lunch. came here last weekend and was seated in 5 mins. soba is a good option when you are not in the mood for another salad but want something sort of healthy.
Mick B.}Manhattan, NY}1107}221}614}-1}3}4/24/2015}It's alright. Can't stack up to Ivan or Ippudo. It was a rainy, miserable day when I was there and that may be unfairly influencing my rating here, but I don't recall being floored. I had some really thick, tasty gravy-style udon. Good, not great. Were it not for the photo and the crummy weather, I wouldn't remember anything about my experience. One of the countless forgettable meals in your life. It's the boring ham sandwich of the soba/udon/ramen restaurants in the city.
J L.}New York, NY}23}142}4}-1}4}4/22/2015}I haven't been here in a while but the food has always been good. The menu is limited mostly to soba (fittingly) and a couple rice bowls. Theres usually a wait so try to get there early.
Claudia C.}Los Angeles, CA}209}209}66}18}3}4/22/2015}Everything was just okay.We ordered the hot soba with tempura and sake don (salmon sashimi and salmon roe with rice) and I thought they were very average, with the soba better than the don. The soba noodles and broth were excellent, and the noodles tasted very fresh. Was really refreshing to have good soba. The tempura, however, was a huge disappointment. For $20, I got 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and some vegetables along with my soba. This would've been perfectly acceptable if the tempura were cooked to perfection or near perfection, but it was below my standards. The tempura was oily and the panko was dark yellow (which means it was overcooked). The salmon sashimi and salmon roe were delicious and fresh, but the rice itself was way too wet and stuck together oddly. The service was great but overall, not very impressed with this place especially at the price range.
Jamie Z.}Manhattan, NY}0}17}2}-1}1}4/20/2015}Waitress was mean. Ordered soba but gave me udon and insisted that I ordered udon. Everyone on my table heard that I said soba. When I asked to exchange. She said the udon I didn't order will be charged bc I touched it. Uh GIRLLL you tell me how to identify udon& soba under bunch of vegi and toppings. Worst service I ever encountered in Manhattan.
Wanmeng Z.}Barcelona, Spain}1}74}47}-1}3}4/19/2015}Had Yasai soup (Mixed vegetables & mushrooms) and Oyako Don (Fresh salmon sashimi & salmon roe w rice), both were ok. Soup was bit overly salty and the rice was too plain. Mixed together, ok. Some of the salmon was not very fresh. The soup was a bit plain. But loved the dessert: we got green tea ice cream, black sesame ice cream and honey & wasabi ice cream. The honey&wasabi was strong! Loved the bitterness and matcha taste of the green tea one. Black sesame was a bit icy and not as smooth in texture but nice. The decor, jazz music, and friendliness of staff is "A+" level though!
J C.}Fairfax, VA}4}164}39}-1}2}4/16/2015}Absolutely disgusting. We kept ordering because I really wanted to find something good here.Sake don was ok.Their soba... SO disgusting. SO overpriced. SO overrated. I almost puked when I smelled the soup. I know you have to go to West coast to eat good asian food, but this was way too below average. I will stick with Cocoron when I'm in NYC.
Lucie T.}Yonkers, NY}260}435}2}-1}4}4/15/2015}I am a noodle hound, specially noodle soups, I think I can live on them, and even in the summer time.  I suppose that's part of my make up.  This place has been on my list of "tries" for many years, and so I finally remembered to go last night. We were waiting to get a massage upstairs so this was the perfect quick and healthy meal, we both had the yanzi hot soba (mushroom and veggies) with some additional toppings (chicken and daikon) and the 100g portion which if I can be honest though it was the smallest of the options was still really large and I couldn't finish it.  Service was grand, and of course green tea was served along with the soup.Had we been more hungry and had more time :Enter Soba-ya's early bird special $20 for 4 course dinner meal.  This is kind of unheard of in this day an age, so I think I will absolutely take an advantage of this next time.
Jill R.}New York, NY}498}91}479}-1}3}4/10/2015}I've had my share of overpriced Japanese food, but this takes the cake. Ordered the uni jelly, hot duck soba and honey vanilla wasabi ice cream. The uni jelly had a nice yuzu flavor to compliment the delicate uni. This, I would recommend. However, the duck soba was so disappointing. The texture was off putting. It was like overcooked beef from Chinese take out and then dumped into a soup. The broth was tasty though and was the saving factor of this dish. The soba was also overcooked and too soft. As a place called "Soba-ya,"I was expecting a lot more. Despite my strong feelings against the duck soba, I decided to go forward and order the vanilla honey wasabi ice cream. One scoop is pretty good for at least 3 people, just to taste. It was very interesting and actually reminded me of those fried noodles you get for free at Chinese take outs with the spicy mustard, but in ice cream form and slightly more sweet with a nice balance. It wasn't a total letdown, but I just know that if I want soba, I'll definitely go back to Cocoron!
Ronnie D.}New York, NY}0}32}0}-1}5}4/6/2015}The hostess (the one I encountered at least) was both very rude and spoke very poor english. The food was amazing though, and that's what matters. Oh and also the waiters were nice.
Sylvia K.}Seattle, WA}256}996}3610}18}4}4/5/2015}A friend of mine who used to live here recommended this place for their handmade soba noodles. I love Japanese food and soba noodles sounded perfect for lunch. Arrived a few minutes before the place was scheduled to open and there were already a few people waiting by the entrance. We were all seated once the place opened up. The menu is essentially your choice of soba or udon (but why would you get udon in a place that specializes in handmade soba and has soba in the name?? I bet the udon is good too though!) and your choice of hot or cold noodles. Hot soba comes in a hot broth, while cold soba comes with a sauce that you dip your noodles in. Since it was a cold brisk day outside, I opted to get the hot soba noodles, but as part of the mini lunch set, which comes with a small size noodle (choice of hot or cold soba or udon) and a small size rice bowl (choose from oyako don, chicken katsu don, pork katsu don, veggie tempura don, and more!). The meal also came with some small and cute sides, including a piece of cooked sweet potato, a piece of kabocha pumpkin, some slices of lotus root, and some pickled carrots, cucumber, and something else. The presentation was really pretty. And it was a lot of food even though it was the mini lunch set - because the oyako don I picked was pretty filling. The soba noodles were really good, but maybe because I got it hot and in the broth, I couldn't really taste the handmade quality. In retrospect, I wish I had gotten the cold soba noodles (next time!). The oyako don was pretty good, but some of the chicken meat was a tad dry. Overall, a nice solid lunch and very filling!
karen l.}New York, NY}4}7}1}-1}1}4/4/2015}I agree with a Vivian F. I've been to Soba-ya many times over the past years, and always thought the the food was delicious - but the last two times I've eaten there for lunch on the weekdays I've experienced symptoms of mild food poisoning. The first time this happened (about 6 months ago), I thought it couldn't possibly be from this restaurant, it's a popular spot and doesn't look dicey - but just yesterday I ordered almost the same thing (the tempura rice bowl vs mini set) and six hours later, while I was at work and before I ate anything else, the same thing happened again. I'm mad at Soba-ya for poisoning me, and I'm mad at myself for going back despite my previous incident.
Justine S.}Annandale, VA}345}303}544}18}2}4/3/2015}Don't get me wrong this place has delicious food, but my experience was so horrible I couldn't even enjoy myself.We came here on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised that our 30-40 minute wait turned into 5-10 minutes.When waiting for a table, it's kind of a given that you look over the menu to get an idea of what to order. With that said, I already knew what I wanted-- the plain hot soba kama-age with dipping sauce with added boiled spinach, chicken, tofu, mushrooms, and uni on the side. When I placed my order, however, I was told not to order the kama-age because it was "for children"...even though I could clearly see many customers ordering it. He also said I should get cold soba due to the toppings I wanted to add. OK? So I asked for everything again but with cold soba. THEN he proceeded to tell me my toppings were more for the hot broth. What? You just told me the opposite a second ago bro. He basically told me to order one of the already assembled soups which I did NOT want, or else I would've ordered it. He gave us another minute to look over the menu and upon his return to take our orders, I allowed my boyfriend to order first. He ordered the kama-age with dipping sauce, and with his choice of toppings with no problems.I ended up ordering the cold Uni soba bowl with mountain yam. I didn't understand why I was given such a hard time when my boyfriend ordered virtually the same thing I wanted to. The uni was divine, but the cold broth was unpleasant in my opinion. His food, however, was all delicious. He had added shrimp tempura which was perfectly crisp and tasty. The dipping sauce he had was amazing. In addition, it was nice to be able to watch the chef make fresh soba noodles. In the end, it could have been a much better experience had I been able to order what I wanted instead of him trying to make confusing suggestions. Oh well. C'est la vie!
Sarita L.}Manhattan, NY}1}30}0}-1}4}4/3/2015}I went here with a friend who likes this spot. Its good, standard spot. I ordered a small tanukki soup (I think its called with soba noodles). It was def more than enough soup for one person. We also split the edamame and tuna tartar. Edamame was good not sure how you mess that up, but couldn't really eat the tuna tartar. It wasn't the typical tartar I've had. It was just fresh tuna with some odd asian vegetable and avocado in between. The tuna almost tasted like it was unfrozen recently. I would go back though, the soup was yum.
Nikki L.}Manhattan, NY}204}1037}104}18}4}3/29/2015}The cold soba with grated mountain yam topped with a plentiful amount of uni and nori strips.
Ferdinand C.}Bronx, NY}46}192}4}18}3}3/29/2015}We had to send back our steamed shrimp shumai because the middle was cold. The second one they brought us was still lukewarm in the middle. The agedashi tofu was great. Crisp on the outside and hot in the inside. The uni supplement for the soba was also good. They gave a good portion. The nebeyaki udon was great. The temperature was still hot even at the end of the meal. Service was great.
Jack J.}Philadelphia, PA}364}165}395}18}3}3/28/2015}I've always been a fan of soba, so when I found this place on my last trip to New York I was pretty excited. The food itself wasn't that bad, but it definitely wasn't good enough to warrant the 1.5 hour wait. Not to mention the hostess told us the wait would only be 20 minutes long. Yes, the interior is really well decorated. And yes, it is cool being able to see the soba being made. But a lot of the novelty wears off after getting served a pretty salty bowl of noodles. I will say that my friend thought that the soba noodles themselves were quite delicious and perhaps the dish I got (nabeyaki) wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Being a carnivore, I will never be satisfied with just a bowl full of carbs and little meat. Most people eating here were Asian women in their 20s... go figure. All in all, I likely wouldn't come here again for dinner on a weekend. The wait seriously was not worth it.
Shani T.}Boston, MA}145}225}121}18}3}3/27/2015}I had really high hopes for this place, but found it a bit on the expensive side for what I got. Boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for lunch due to the great reviews. I'm a big fan of soba, I love how healthy it is and was looking forward to my meal here.I ordered the Kamo Seiro (cold duck soba) and my boyfriend ordered something that I unfortunately can't recall. Service was definitely on the slow side, and it wasn't particularly busy when we went in. There was a pretty long delay between us getting seated, ordering, getting our food, and getting our check.Honestly, I was disappointed with my duck soba. For $15, I expected a lot more, I guess. The duck was tender but it wasn't as flavorful as it could have been. Just seemed a bit lacking, in my opinion. The dipping sauce was luke warm at best, almost cold. It also wasn't particularly filling, and I've definitely had soba before that filled me up.Overall, it was just a mediocre and not very memorable meal.
Brian M.}Edgewater, NJ}26}19}11}-1}5}3/26/2015}Can you really argue with fresh soba noodles & fresh uni. Once you enter the ambiance and decor is subtle yet relaxing. You'll notice the soba noodle maker to increase your appetite. I would definitely go back and try the other dishes they have to offer.
Sara Y.}New York, NY}64}155}87}18}5}3/25/2015}I love this place. Their soba and rice bowls are sooooo good. There is always a long wait but its worth it. I always get the cold duck soba and I share the salmon and salmon roe rice bowl with my friend.
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}3/15/2015}There's some place, either you like it, or you like it, Sobaya is one of them.Was introduced this place by my friend as the best soba in Manhattan. As a soba person, I know I'm gonna try it out. I got the cold duck soba, with hot soup to dip the bucket wheat noodle into. After you finish, there's rice noodle soup to pour into the original sauce. Everything went perfectly well with each other.Another remarkable memory was their dessert. Honey wasabi flavor was their must-try.
Vivian F.}CANAL STREET, NY}214}6}7}-1}1}3/14/2015}Went there for a quick snack....I got a bowl of soba and my boyfriend ordered the black cod fish...15 min out of the restaurant and he has been getting the typical symptoms of food poisoning...vomiting and severe abdominal painsOne hours later, I called the restaurant ...and there is no manager to speak to...and the guy on the phone didn't understand what  "got sick from the food" nor what "food poisoning" meant. 1.5 hours later, spoke to some guy who acknowledges the situation and didn't even apologize. ...he says "it's the weekend and it's very busy...I don't know what to do for you now.  There is no manager."2 hours, I spoke to the hostess, who immediately said "sorry"...and that a manager will call me back tomorrow.PLEASE BEWARE since I feel the restaurant's staff is oblivious about food hygiene/ safety and how to handle to situation.Stay healthy everyone!
Duc D.}Los Angeles, CA}52}73}109}-1}4}3/11/2015}This was my first taste of handmade Soba noodles and it was fantastic. My friends and I came here on a lark after a night of excessive drinking and late night pizza, so this was a very healthy and light way to sober up. The place was busy when we arrived on Sunday afternoon, but not extremely packed. The hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait and was very sweet, making small talk with us as we waited. When our table was ready in the 15 minutes, she kindly opened the coat check door where we plunked down our gear. I guess they're used to travelers with their bags because there were quite a few bags and suitcases in the space.We were then seated and thought about saki but opted for some lovely green tea and water as we decided on what we'd order. I went for the Kamo Seiro which is duck slices and green onion in hot dipping sauce with cold Soba noodles (cold's the only way to go, right?) and found myself eyeing the shrimp tempura but the waitress recommended I try the assorted tempura, which I eventually got. Upon getting our food, it seemed my Soba bamboo mat was piled high with noodles. This isn't the case though, as the plate is pretty shallow. They do give you a decent amount of noodles, but I'll probably get extra next time. The cold noodles dipped into the hot and tasty dipping sauce was perfect. It wasn't overly salty and slurping up the noodles and crunching down on some of the most tender tempura shrimp I've ever had was quite satisfying. It wasn't too heavy but gave me enough to want just a bit more. One of my friends made the mistake of using the tempura sauce for his noodles, whereas I used his noodle dipping sauce for my tempura. Total newbs! If you order tempura and soba noodles here, just remember that the shallow dish is the tempura sauce and the cups, larger bowls are for the noodles themselves. We only found out later of the mistake when the waitress came by and offered us a red box full of the water used to cook the noodles. She told us to use it to put into the dipping sauce to make a broth soup to sip. We looked at each other in dismay and felt quite stupid. All in good fun, but we won't be making that mistake twice.I wasn't down for any dessert, but I heard the mochi balls were pretty fantastic. Definitely a spot to return to on my next visit to NYC.
Chieri O.}Davis, CA}14}13}1}-1}4}3/8/2015}I've been to many restaurants in Japan, and to me soba-ya tasted very authentic. I got the mini bento box lunch special with maguro don, and everything was great! Soba noodles had the texture of being freshly made and the broth was the right amount of saltiness. Maguro-don could have used better fish, so 4 stars. But overall very satisfied. I would definitely go back.
Jackie M.}Chicago, IL}232}344}1117}-1}3}3/4/2015}Walk in only!!! No reservation allow.. I was very excited about coming here. Coming from the Midwest, there is lack of authentic soba or udon joint. I ordered the popular duck soba soup in large (difference of $3 to upgrade). For almost $20 for a bowl of noodle, the portion is quite generous. However, the duck was too well done and the soba gets quite bland as you eat. It's to a point where i'm struggling to finish and didnt enjoy it anymore.. The milk tofu was delighful and not too sweet. It was homemade, but presented with a frozen piece of strawberry.  Not quite sure why i would get a frozen strawberry when the mochi was complimented with fresh strawberry? The honey wasabi ice cream was interesting. I really enjoy it and the wasabi can really get you if you eat it fast enough. Overall, the hostess and the waitress were very attentive and nice.
Viv M.}New York, NY}196}105}17}-1}4}3/2/2015}Wonderful meal at Sobaya. There was no wait when we came in at 6pm on a Sunday night, though by the time we left around 7:30, a line had formed. We got the large tempura appetizer, the Tororo soba (regular size; hot; yam soba), the Ikura Oroshi soba (large size; cold; salmon roe soba), the sobaya manju dessert, and the honey wasabi ice cream dessert. The tempura appetizer was simply amazing. A large size got us several pieces of shrimp, 1 broccoli, 1 sweet potato, 1 regular potato, 1 squid, and 1 eggplant. It came out piping hot, with perfectly fried and not-at-all greasy tempura flakes. This was probably one of the best tempuras that I have had. The only complaint is that it is a large size that goes for around $20, which is a little pricey considering that this only solidly, but not overwhelmingly, fed two people. For that price for an appetizer, I expected more. The soba was of course, delicious. When I took my first sip of the tororo broth, I felt totally transported back to Japan, as cheesy as that sounds. It was salty in a good way, and had great depth of flavor that melded perfectly with the seaweed strips in there. The ikura oroshi soba was also amazing. The soba in that dish was cooked more al dente than with the tororo soba, which I suspect is because my tororo was in hot broth that kept cooking it for a bit. That's just a note if you are wondering if the temperature affects noodle texture. The honey wasabi ice cream was as remarkable as everyone says. I think it has a vanilla-y base, but is layered with a very real wasabi burn. Totally different than anything I have tried, and very special. I would not recommend the sobya manju dessert, however. This is basically a red bean bun, but made with the buckwheat flour instead of regular flour. IMO, the buckwheat flour has too coarse of a texture for a red bean bun.Service was pretty good overall. Prompt with everything, but definitely got the message to leave towards the end, as the line was starting to form. I get that, but the check came down as we were still eating two dessert dishes that were nowhere close to being finished yet, so slightly annoying. Probably would have been more polite to wait until dishes are cleared first.
Olivia H.}Palisades Park, NJ}504}137}534}-1}3}2/28/2015}To be honest, I think it's mostly hype. We ordered one hot soba and one cold soba and 2 dons and ended with 2 desserts. Out of everything I really wouldn't say anything was superb. It was pretty salty to a point that my bf had to stop eating his cold soba because the vegetables were overly marinated in soy sauce.  They gave a box of what tasted like rice water, we have something similar in Korean food. I like this cause it neutralized the saltiness from both soba dishes. I was impressed with how much toppings they actually put in my vegetable/mushroom hot soba, I added tempera flakes and tofu as toppings. I do like the plethora of toppings you can add to any of your soba dishes it's basically like a make your own soba! The best part of the dinner was the dessert easily. Got the green tea Brûlée and 3 scoops assortment ice cream ; honey wasabi, black sesame, and green tea. Prob the best Japanese ice cream flavors I've tried. No store bought ice cream really compares.Service was great. no wait because we sat at the sushi bar. You order with the sushi guy infront of you. so It was super convenient for those who don't want to deal with waiting for a waiter/waitress Total price: $91 not bad for 6 dishes. I would be back for lunch box special for cold soba... Maybeeeee...
Anneke R.}Brooklyn, NY}0}7}0}-1}3}2/26/2015}I could tell the place was authentic Japanese by the diners and the presentation of the food. But the chicken oyakadon was too mushy for me. The egg was pretty raw; I couldn't eat more than a few bites.
PD K.}New York, NY}15}75}13}-1}4}2/24/2015}Definitely good soba place for the price. Came here few times and have really nothing bad to say about this place. I would give this place 5 stars but I know a better soba place in Midtown so that is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars!
Lynn H.}Forest Hills, NY}18}8}12}-1}4}2/22/2015}It is better to come have lunch @ soba-ya. The portion is like twice bigger than dinner and yet cheaper. I like their lunch set. Hand made hot soba is very delicious. I can't pass their green tea ice cream. So yummy! Highly recommend.
Natasha K.}New York, NY}13}43}15}-1}5}2/22/2015}Amazing soba, lovely service. The venue is oh-so-Japanese. It is a wonderful little gem in the city. There is always a wait for dinner. I would opt for the lunch set, which is affordable and is offered at a less crowded time.
Asdy W.}New York, NY}39}78}31}-1}4}2/21/2015}Came here under a friend's suggestion since we were thinking of post-work dinner ideas. No reservation here unless you're a bigger party, but my friend and I rolled in around 5:30 on a Thursday which is right before the huge dinner crowd.All the cold soba dishes here they give you a little small pot of Japanese soy sauce (which is milder than normal soy sauce, so don't worry about pouring a lot of it in) I got the chirashi after much thinking. Basically the fish/veggie thing they put on it is just one lump of that fried together as a tempura. I thought the tempura was pretty tasty. Although the so called fish they put in there must be tiny because it was buried inside the fried veggies and I could barely tell where the fish was! The rest of the dish for me was just alright, not bad, but not fantasmic. There was some blanched spinach, tamago, little pieces of shaped seafood that was too mushy for my tastes, and shitake mushroom.The soba itself was pretty alright and smooth I guess. No complaints there. However these type of cold soba dishes is definitely for the type of person who prefers a more clean/refreshing/simple type of palette, don't expect any bold flavors here. I ordered a large, thinking how I usually am a fatty, but it was actually a tad bit on the too much noodles side for me. I probably should have stuck with a normal size.
Emily W.}Los Angeles, CA}2}16}11}-1}5}2/20/2015}Very good and decent Japanese noodle place. Food is not too expensive around 17-20 dollars big bowl. Although food is q bit salty, it's a meal definitely wort your money.
Jane K.}Los Angeles, CA}153}91}37}-1}4}2/19/2015}I come here too often for my soba fix -- partially because i love to watch them make their own soba noodles. i recommend their udon just as much as their soba. and their donburi (rice bowl dishes) is bomb too. their grilled fish is a tad salty.
Cristina L.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}129}263}601}18}4}2/16/2015}This was my second time here. First time was for dinner. I had the hot soba with tempera. It was ok. The strawberry sauce in the tofu dessert was my favorite. It was sweet. The second time, I went for lunch. They have a limited amount of lunch set. So make sure to go early if you want the lunch set. I got the lunch box. This time the soba tasted a lot better. The grilled salmon was prefect the way I like it. It wasn't over cook or fried. I think the lunch set was definately worth the price. The customer service that day was ok. It took them a while to filled the tea. We also didn't get the free tea after you finished eating.
Chenchen Q.}London, United Kingdom}5}5}2}-1}2}2/13/2015}Actually this is not as good as I EXPECTED. Only the cob fish is good, other than that nothing meet my expectation, and I dont think the food matches the price.
Lisa T.}Chicago, IL}245}176}711}-1}4}2/13/2015}Food (4/5):I love noodles, so I will let you imagine how ecstatic / in heaven I was when I got to try this place out. I ordered the duck cold soba, regular sized (150g). I appreciated the different portions for the noodles (choices of 100g, 150g, or 200g), and the flavor of the dipping sauce was on point although I wish the broth was a bit hotter. The noodles were a good, chewy consistency and the broth was not overwhelmingly salty. The duck was tender and had adequately soaked up the broth flavors.For dessert, my group decided to order the green tea creme brulee and the honey wasabi ice cream. Unlike the entree orders, I can't say I was impressed with dessert. The green tea creme brulee was surprisingly deep for a creme brulee (typically shallow / short in height). The sugar crystallization was there, but I didn't taste any green tea flavoring in it at all. The honey wasabi ice cream, on the other hand, packed wasabi flavor, but it clashed with the honey so it didn't sit well with my palate. All in all, I would choose to skip the desserts altogether next time and order only the noodles.Service (2/5):So our waiter. If he was actually present for most of the time, I could give a rating. Alas, I was never sure where he was. From seating to the hot towel to the ordering to paying our checks to signing receipts, I could have sworn he must have taken a mini-break between each one. I felt like our group was waiting on end for him to finally take our order or bring back our credit cards after swiping. Granted, we were there on a Saturday night, but it was nearly 10:30PM - 11:00PM. Most of your patrons have left, so what's the hold up?Atmosphere (4/5):This entire place is so zen-like. Earthy tones everywhere that are reminiscent of Japan. If I could, I'd only want to come with my boyfriend next time since it feels like an intimate environment. Very clean establishment from what I can tell. Seating / table sizes are definitely more suited for parties of 2-4.Overall, noodle dishes make this place a solid 4-star establishment. I would avoid all desserts. The desserts would make this place 3-stars tops, but considering I really liked the soba... I'll just pretend that the dessert menu doesn't even exist. If I'm ever back in town for leisure or work, I'll be sure to drop by again.
Teresa C.}New York, NY}149}452}1630}18}3}2/5/2015}PROS:- Tuna Yuba Maki (tuna wrapped with bean curd) - this one is my favorite appetizer. It's got avocado layered on the bottom and it goes so well with the tuna. Loved it!- Sashimi Moriawase (assorted sashimi) - out of the assorted sashimi, my favorites were salmon and tuna. I never really like uni so I can't judge it. The sashimi was fresh however this dish was PRICEY. - Yamakake Cold Soba (Soy Cured Tuna with Grated Mountain Yam) - My friend ordered this and I must say this one tasted better than Chirashi. Yes, the grated yam is a little slimy but mixed in with the tuna and the sauce for the soba, it tasted really good. When you are almost the with the soba, the waiter will bring some hot broth in this red squarish kettle (?) to mix in the soba. I must say it tasted pretty interesting depending on how much broth you pour in to mix with the soba.- Chirashi Cold Soba (Baby Sardine Tempura, Japanese Omelette, Shiitake, Fried Bean Curd & Fish Cake) - What I really liked was the Shiitake mushroom. It was marinated really well and it tasted sweet. The tempura was okay. The japanese omelette, fried bean curd, and fish was standard. All together it paired well with the soba but you definitely needed to pour the sauce it to make the soba taste better.THE OKAY:- Ika-meshi (simmered squid wrapped around sticky rice). Nothing special. Squid was marinated/drenched in sweet sauce and was a little chewy. It taste good but it wasn't amazing. I could get the same sticky rice taste in Asian dim sum place only this one tastes sweeter.- Tuna Mini Don - was ok.- Sobaya Manju & Green Tea Ice Cream - The Manju was ok. It was buckwheat bread with red bean filling. Only thing special is that it was made with buckwheat so it's healthy. Nothing out of the ordinary that I can't get for less. Green Tea Ice Cream was good. It's a little bit bitter compared to the other green tea ice I have had but I liked it.- Green Tea Brulee - it was OK. You can PASS on this.CON:- Service was alright. Our waiter forgot to give us the hot towels to wipe our hands at the beginning of the meal.- Tofu salad - it was alright. Nothing special. The thinly sliced fried tofu was burnt and made the over all salad taste burnt so I wouldn't recommend this salad.- Honey Wasabi Ice Cream - OVERRATED. It was great to try for like a small nibble but one full spoon of this wasabi ice cream can cause some action in your nose. The crunchy bits in the ice cream was good but taste wise I didn't like the wasabi flavor.
Ferdinand H.}Baltimore, MD}1282}647}2}-1}5}1/30/2015}You have to love sobaya, a restaurant that tells you what they serve, and boy do they serve it well.  While there's the option for Udon and other cooked foods, but honestly, there's something refreshing and wonderful about freshly cooked, and appropriately textured soba.  :)Warm woods, and tasty food - reasonable selection of nihonshu.  5/5!
Ben L.}Queens, NY}943}947}2632}18}4}1/29/2015}I haven't been back in about ten years and I am happy to say the food is pretty much the same. I always get skeptical when a place is open so long that they get used to the popularity and stop giving a shit. The food is as good as I remember and the Japanese staff is still friendly and warm. I was kinda shocked at the abundance of space between tables, I would normally feel cramped in a restaurant, especially in the city, with the table next to us but the tables were properly spaced and I felt super relaxed. Like no accidental butt bump on the next table. =) For the noodle dishes, you have the option doing of Soba or Udon, truth be told I have yet to try the Udon at Soba-ya. I have only done the Soba and it think it's best to be eaten cold. I think the texture differs drastically when it is eaten hot. Udon I have had in Japan hot and cold and I think it could go both ways.The food:Ten Zaru- Shrimp, Shiso and Shishito tempura. I ordered the mini. I think this is kinda the classic soba dish. I think the chew and texture of the soba was fantastic. The dipping sauce was great but does get salty towards the end. The tempura was actually a lot more than I was expecting. The tempura had nice flavor but was greasy. The big ass shrimp had nice flavor and the three was kinda of a surprise. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Una Ju- broiled eel over rice. I ordered the mini as well. I thought the flavor of the eel was excellent. It was a nice meaty fish, nice fat content and a good size portion. As much as I liked the eel, I thought the sauce was too sweet and there was too much of it. I guess ask for a little less sauce and it would be fantastico.Sake Oyako Don- sliced Salmon sashimi and salmon roe over rice. I have had this dish many times and it is a solid choice, The salmon is nice and fatty and has a wonderful texture. The roe offers a nice salty note to the salmon. I do wish there was vinegar in the rice. Maguro Yamakake- soy cured tuna & grated mountain yam. I think the flavor of the soy and the tuna are wonderful, but I think the texture of the mountain yam is off putting. The texture is slimy and it doesn't have a pronounced flavor, but the soy does help with flavor.
Andrea V.}Long Island City, NY}36}11}3}-1}4}1/25/2015}Love the atmosphere here, very warm with great service; waitress was very attentive with a smile on her face. Very fresh food; my family had a sashimi combo, shrimp shumai, the soft shell crap, Nabeyaki Udon, all which were delicious. Prices are reasonable.FYI: They have a toilet seat heater in their bathroom! Very cool!
Ben L.}Manhattan, NY}181}128}16}-1}1}1/25/2015}This was among the most epically disappointing dining experiences of my life. This was all build up and no delivery. My expectations were pretty high as there was a 45 minute+ wait and they had a Michelin recommendation.I had the spinach with a sesame dressing as an appetizer. It was okay nothing special, and an incredibly small portion, but I couldn't majorly fault it.I had the duck soba soup and my dining companion had the classic soba. The broth was incredibly salty and one note. The only other thing I could taste is a slightly sour flavor, but otherwise it just tasted like spoonfuls of salt water. The sautéed duck breast was awful. It was rubbery and flavorless. The noodles, which they pride themselves for making by hand on site, were OKAY, but borderline soggy. The tempura that can be added to the classic soba was on the greasy side. We had sake with our meal, it was okay, but as with absolutely everything else here it was overpriced.I left feeling like I wasted my time and money. I'm indignant as a consumer. The service was OKAY, but far from a saving grace of this place. It's an uncomfortable and chaotic environment too, which really doesn't bother me usually but it just seemed to be the cherry on top of an overall mediocre experience.
Stephanie Q.}Boston, MA}491}1502}1294}18}4}1/23/2015}A family friend back in Japan used to make soba for me, by hand. I was always amazed watching her make the soba, chopping up the noodles carefully by hand. Well, now that I live in New York, I go to soba-ya when I am craving hand-made soba.There is a guy there showing off his skills, making the soba from scratch. Its very fascinating to watch.The prices aren't exactly cheap here, you should plan on paying about $20 for a bowl of soba. You also can't make a reservation and there is usually a bit of a wait.When you order your soba, you have to decide if you want it to be hot or cold. I decided to go for the hot soba with fried chicken (which they submerged inside so it wasn't crispy anymore, oh well). There are 3 sizes, I suggest going for the "normal" size if you are moderately hungry, and the large size if you are extremely hungry. If you are on a diet, I guess you can go for the smallest size. They also have 3 types of sake cocktails, which are delicious and strong at the same time. And if you really really like the soba and want to make some at home, go to Sunrise mart nearby and buy some!
Asta S.}Boston, MA}22}339}28}-1}3}1/22/2015}I had a hankering for udon, but instead of going to one of the cheap places a few streets down, my friend recommended this place. I LOVED that you could watch the soba noodles being made as you waited for a table, which was mezmerizing as the chef rolled out the dough, again, and again, with such precision, and then chopped the noodles by hand.  Yes, we waited, and if you're not going at an off hour, you will probably wait too, but it;s worth it. (watching the soba preparation helps).  We had a great meal, and noticed all the items I can't wait to try next time.    For dessert, we tried the red bean ice cream, which was lovely because it was not too sweet and the green tea, which was very tea-y.  Only warning would be to WATCH OUT for the wasabi ice cream.  It goes down all innocent, but has a WICKED aftertaste.
A L.}New York, NY}23}147}215}-1}4}1/19/2015}Had their dinner early bird special. Everything was too fried for me. It was fried tempura, fried broccoli, fried carrot and fried eggplant. The udon noodle was a bit salty. The appetizer was okay, out of the four items I only liked the sweet potatoe. The dessert was delicious tho! Wanted seconds loll
Lindsay S.}New York, NY}95}281}230}-1}4}1/14/2015}My roommate and I stopped in here with a friend of mine when we couldn't get into a ramen shop nearby for a nice warm meal. I was so glad that we came in here because the restaurant was incredibly spacious and the service was quick and impressive. We got the hot kamo seiro soup, but I ended up going with the udon noodles because I was so hungry I needed a thicker noodle to fill me up more. I ordered the small portion, as well as my roommate, which was actually a pretty big portion because I had leftovers to take home. I definitely want to try some of the other dishes and the appetizers next time I am in need of a nice warm meal on a chilly day.
Aaron S.}Fort Worth, TX}64}120}278}-1}5}1/12/2015}A great small and cozy little Japanese restaurant that serves great Ramen and also has very good sashimi as an appetizer.I arrived here later on a Friday night with my buddy and we sat at the bar.Service was prompt and easy. We had the tuna sashimi appetizer which I thought was excellent and five stars. We also ordered a bottle of the Nigori unfiltered sake. It came out on ice and for $50 for a large bottle it was very good. Slightly sweet but very nice.The pork Ramen with the egg was excellent. I highly enjoyed it. I got the thinner soba noodles which I would recommend.Overall a cool spot and I would definitely come back.
Shannon Z.}Brooklyn, NY}447}705}446}18}2}1/12/2015}Soba-ya was nothing special. For $18 I expected something that was amazinggggg but the fried chicken cold soba was just that. The fried chicken didnt have flavor and was a weird texture after dunked into the soba dipping sauce. Definitely not worth that much money. Meh.. 2.5 stars.
Annie P.}Brooklyn, NY}2}27}72}-1}5}1/12/2015}The service was beyond awesome. We sat at the bar. The waiter took care of us well.The food is really good too. We all had the mini lunch box with soba.We did not expect the wait. It was a Saturday at 12pm. It was packed! We waited 40ish minutes to be called in. Very worth the money and wait.Looking forward to go again!
Aelita P.}Philadelphia, PA}307}279}551}18}5}1/12/2015}I came here on a Saturday with a friend at about 6:30, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for seating (not bad since there were quite a few other groups waiting). I'm from Philly where no Japanese restaurant has Japanese employees, so it was nice to see that a lot of waitresses and the sushi-chef (couldn't see the cooks) were actually Japanese. My friend ordered the umeshu which was really good and quite strong, and the umeboshi was delicious and alcohol soaked. I ordered Ten-Zaru (cold soba noodles) with tempura. The soba was AMAZING, extremely fresh, extremely flavorful. The tempura was very heavy (maybe I just wasn't really in the mood for it that day) so I wasn't a big fan, but I liked the presentation at least. My friend ordered cold udon with tuna. He really liked his udon, and we both said that the next time we'd just get the soba/udon plain - it can easily stand on it's own.I'll definitely be going back the next time I'm in the city - my mom, who's from Japan, would LOVE it. IAs a side note: My friend and I both studied abroad in Japan and I've been going to Japan with family all of my life, so we both speak Japanese (albeit not fluently - and mine is getting progressively worse) and when we ordered in Japanese she responded in turn which I appreciated (even though she could tell we weren't fluent).
Chloe G.}New York, NY}96}173}533}-1}3}1/11/2015}Authentic Japanese soba place with a little noodle bar and full pack of customer in a tiny space. If you wanna have real soba, do try here!
Kevin M.}New York, NY}0}8}1}-1}5}1/11/2015}I really love this place. Whatever I order, the flavours never fail to surprise me with their intensity and freshness. I always leave this place having tasted something I've never experienced before. I take it the food is pretty authentic too judging by the other guests. The decor is cute and the staff welcoming and attentive. A heartwarming restaurant for a cold winter's day.
Cindy W.}Boston, MA}14}61}212}18}5}1/5/2015}5 stars for their handmade sobaThe Food I ordered the Stamina Seiro which is fried chicken & garlic with hot dipping sauce. The sauce is unique, you can taste the garlic and some zesty orange. The chicken is just alright nothing special..It was a new experience eating a hot soba with soup. The downside is that it was not hot enough for me. My boyfriend ordered Kamo Seiro which is a sauteed duck slice & tokyo negi in hot dipping sauce. The duck was delicious!! the soup itself was soothing for winter. I would recommended getting the duck instead of the chicken. The waiter then gave us a pot of soup to mix with the sauce and drink the soup. It was delicious, but i preder my boyfriend's broth.AtmosphereThe place is a medium size and they have a sushi stand or bar stand which you can sit on. Overall!I will definitely come back and try more of their menu. As their soba itself is really good and fresh.
Paris F.}New York, NY}11}306}186}-1}5}1/4/2015}My favorite regular lunch spot.  I love their udon and soba noodles.  I also like their seared tuna garlic sauce on the rice.  The authenticity of the soba noodles is not to be missed!
Tiffany T.}Eugene, OR}127}349}682}18}4}12/28/2014}Came here with my sister and cousin and we were the first ones in line! ;) I got the tuna steak don lunch set with cold soba noodles. So delicious! I was able to finish it all except for the mini side dishes that came with it. Next time, I want to try the uni soba noodles.
Danny C.}Manhattan, NY}160}32}27}-1}4}12/27/2014}The vegetable and mushroom soba was great. Flavorful and delicious. The mountain yam on rice is strange. The texture is mushy and it's a bit sticky. Small restaurant so they have a coat check area to leave your bags, yoga mat, or whatever you have with you. The tables are really close so there's not much privacy.
Karina T.}Los Angeles, CA}18}28}7}-1}4}12/26/2014}Long wait (45 min) for two, but was worth it in the end. Housemade soba noodles in delicious broth. Japanese servers and traditional dishes. I ordered a soup w seafood and veggies - would go back! The pricing of a side order on the check was high but it was too busy to try to correct it. Just paid and skidaddled.
Tracy F.}New York, NY}4}43}27}-1}5}12/24/2014}I love the lunch special here! I have tried the Sake Oyako Don (Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe over Rice) and Tuna-Steak Don (Seared Tuna Steak over Rice, which is my personal favorite. The sashimi are super fresh and it also comes with a bowl of soba noodles hot/cold. Portion size is perfect for lunch!
Denny S.}Brooklyn, NY}213}354}1015}-1}4}12/17/2014}Awesome place to get Soba!!You can tell that the restaurant is well kept, clean and organize.Whats awesome is you have someone who roll and cut your soba in front of the restaurant..Really good soba and tempura!! Highly recommended! Also, reasonably priced!
Talia J.}San Diego, CA}3}18}0}-1}4}12/17/2014}My sister and I decided to eat at Sobaya when I visited her in NYC last week. We both grew up in Fukuoka, Japan and are pretty picky about Japanese food, particularly when it comes to soba and udon. This place was incredible and delivered us with some yummy food! We started with the agedashi tofu, and she got the kitsune udon while I got the ebi tempura udon. While the broth was a bit more smoke-flavored than I would normally prefer, the shrimp was cooked perfectly and her kitsune was delicious. Not gonna lie - I was jealous that she got a fish cake in her noodles and I didn't! The only reason why I'm taking off a star is because of how pricey this place is. I understand it's New York, so things cost more, but we ended up paying around $80 for two bowls of noodles, a small tofu dish, and a small house sake. With that said, I will likely visit again the next time I come back to the city! Oishisoo.
Doriee D.}Las Vegas, NV}253}370}1311}18}4}12/15/2014}What's more perfect than a piping hot bowl of noodles on a cold NYC night? NOTHING. Duh!My friend and I decided to eat here for dinner on a Friday night and we came here early. We got there about 10 minutes before they opened because it seems like a really popular place and we didn't want to risk a long wait. Despite being early, there were already people waiting in line in front of the restaurant. Though, once they opened, they seated people one after another in a timely manner. As we were being lead to our table, I noticed that there was an area where they kind of showcase the making of their noodles. There was someone there flattening the dough and probably preparing more noodles for the night. It's great to know that the noodles that they serve are hand made! I actually decided to go with their regular sized Kamo Nanban, which is their sauteed duck with green onions. As for the noodles, I decided on the udon since I like the taste of udon better than soba. This bowl of noodles was piping hot and it was such a great feeling when I'm having it on a cold night. It was wonderful. The sauteed duck was pretty good and what's great bout it is that each slice has a slither of duck fat with it, which gives it great flavor as you chew .. and chew ..The noodles itself was really delicious. It was perfectly cooked. Pure comfort. However, the broth that went with my udon was a little bit too tangy for my taste. And the price is a bit steep for udon. I understand that you're getting quality with the price but a regular sized bowl of Kamo Nanban was almost $17. Yikes!  I've been to a restaurant before where they also had hand made udon and their prices were much less than Soba-ya's! Though, overall, it was delicious. It was great on a cold night. And I'd really recommend it.
Jennifer H.}Elmhurst, NY}63}250}20}-1}3}12/15/2014}This place is a little too pricey for my tastes. The soba was good, but it wasn't so good that I would pay $18 again. We started with this crab dumpling appetizer. Do not get! It was very gross. The texture was all gltuen-y and a bit slimy and the flavor was just not good at all. I didn't taste the oceany crab flavor. Instead, all I tasted was some alcohol. This was definitely a waste of $9.I had the soba noodles with grated mountain yam and seaweed, and added chicken pieces as a topping for an extra $2.50. There were so little chicken pieces that it wasn't even worth it to add it. Also, the chicken was bland and tough. It was just boiled chicken breast. The mountain yam was interesting. It made the soba noodles kinda slick and slimy. Also if you mix it in, it will all disappear into the broth. For $18, I was just hoping for more.My boyfriend got the duck soba. It was ok. Of course he was left hungry even after ordering a large bowl.For the price, I would not come back, and the soba wasn't anything special that I've never had before.
Xixi X.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}27}21}8}-1}4}12/11/2014}4.5 for the food and the place overall. I would defiantly come back when I want some good soba: cold or hot.  The place is always busy and there's always a wait!
Joyce L.}Rego Park, Queens, NY}14}2}0}-1}4}12/11/2014}I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon a few days ago. It tasted so amazing. My friend and I love it a lot. I'd like to recommend this one.

Alper E.}Manhattan, NY}62}93}1}-1}4}12/6/2014}Worth for their soba soup. Prefer there for lunch to get the box set !
Ger P.}New York, NY}24}36}29}-1}4}12/4/2014}Its a lovely little soba house tucked away on ninth street next to Robataya. A smallish space but very cozy especially on the cold night that I arrived with a friend. Its a place I would feel comfortable coming alone as well however as there is a bar-seating area towards the rear of the house from which a solo diner might relax while watching dishes being prepared. The service was pleasant as one might expect from such a friendly interior. And the menu seemed eclectic with many items  beckoning me to return (see online for full menu at sobaya-nyc.com/wp/menus). Salmon Sashimi and Agedashi Tofu were presented in an attractive way and satisfying as appetizers. Our main courses were less so, however. My choice of the Tuna and Avocado Don was simply that: minced tuna and avocado over rice, a bit uninspiring. My friend's choice of the Kamo Nanban was better with its comforting slices of sauteed duck/green onions and soba in its warm broth but also less than outstanding. Dessert was easy to like with tofu panna cotta and ice cream though I would suggest (like others on yelp) sharing the wasabi ice cream as it may be overpowering for some. Looking forward to returning. And kudos to the house for offering dishes in "mini", "regular", and "large" sizes -we throw out enuf food as it is.
Jessica H.}Toronto, Canada}100}9}1}-1}4}12/3/2014}I went in a Sunday late evening, there was no line up and were welcomed in immediately by all the waiters in the restaurant. The restaurant was very welcoming and warm. The waiters were very attentive and were very quick to serve, constantly checking up on us and making sure that we were okay. The udon noodles that I ordered were delicious and very fresh. I would definitely recommend going. Quiet little place and definitely amazing food.
Serene T.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}4}359}181}-1}5}11/25/2014}Oh My. Geez.  The wait time is crazy long, people can wait 2 hours and still not be turned away nor discouraged.  After trying so many of their dishes, NOW I KNOW WHY it was worth even 4 hours of waiting!!!  The wait time is insane because during weekends or peak times, the place has sort of limited seating and a huge crowd.  The reason is because the food is SOOOO FRESH.  The noodles are home made, as depicted in the pics but you can taste the freshness in all of the ingredients.My party and I ordered a lot appetizers ranging from the sushi to a chicken roll/wrap that had green tea salt (oh yum).  Then we also tried the pumpkin and shitake, that was ok.  In addition, we also had the shumai (very meaty), the enoki side, seaweed salad with dressing, and various soba and udon dishes.  All to share.  Then for desserts - it was AMAZING. I had no more room left but I saw the photos for the milk pudding and the green tea ice cream.  OH.MY MY MY MY MY.GOODNESS.  The milk pudding was freshly made daily - and they poured the FRESH strawberry sauce on top.  It was decadent.  Then, I did not think green tea ice cream is ever a big deal since most Japanese restaurants serve it, but one taste and it was like heaven.  The green tea ice cream was not sweet but rather it had the matcha type of flavor to it, and that's PURE AMAZING!   This is as authentic as it can get without traveling to Japan.  One bite of the soba/udon noodles takes me back to the Japanese shops where they made their own noodles.  It was truly a world-class experience.  The prices are not all cheap but it's definitely not Megu/Morimoto/Nobu prices either.  I think it is well worth the wait and the cost if you do not mind fresh ingredients and dishes. Service is very very up there so I gave extra gratuities for the hard-work.  I am very impressed with this establishment, it's culture that they have maintained and their overall appeal to their patrons to make them wait without any disappointments.  I feel very proud of businesses such as this, that would draw in committed and a diverse crowd.  I noticed foreigners traveling from Europe and Asia at the restaurant. Great sight to see!
Katie L.}Pasadena, CA}115}13}2}-1}5}11/23/2014}If you're in town and appreciate good Japanese food, especially soba....this is a MUST TRY. The Uni Tororo (Fresh Sea Urchin & Grated Mountain Yam) was delectable, fresh, unique and you end up wanting more.I got the Nameko Oroshi Nameko Mushrooms & Grated Radish with wakami seaweed... this was divine.
John K.}Manhattan, NY}1}16}0}-1}5}11/20/2014}By far one of my favorite places whenever I'm near St Marks. Hot or cold soba all day every day. Also try the Maguro-don - the tuna is super fresh
J. M.}Manhattan, NY}2}10}0}-1}4}11/19/2014}Yes, I get it.  Noodle water can be tasty a.f.  HOWEVER, was this particular bowl of noodle and water particularly tasty?  Uhhh....  maybe?  Was it $14 tasty?  Hmm....  No?  And believe me, I'm a fan of ramen places (see my review of Jin Ramen), but this place just didn't have that ramen *magic* to me.  But then again, so many people love it!  Ugh.I'm so on the fence about this place it's unreal.  I mean, yes, it's cool that:* You get to see a dude making noodles in a glass cubicle* You get to wait in line for like 15 minutes in a small waiting area* ....But, I'm sorry Soba-ya.  I really wanted this to be a thing between us.  I wanted this to be special.  Even all of my friends love you, I just can't bring myself to do this anymore.  I think it's best if we should start seeing other people.
Alyvia M.}New York, NY}478}759}36}18}2}11/19/2014}The service was great. The food was extremely salty, but their selection of unfiltered sake was amazing. I might come back, but I have definitely had better.
D Z.}New York, NY}3}368}10}-1}3}11/19/2014}I had the preset menu which was good but not great.Friendly staff. Good place for dates.Soba noodles are definitely fresh. Did not have any of the sushi.
Roxy I.}Manhattan, NY}37}155}11}-1}4}11/17/2014}Saturday around 7:30pm, the busiest time of a week. They don't take reservation, so we had to wait for about 30-40 mins after we arrived at the restaurant. But they handled it well and the line moved fast.We ordered a few appetizers and I got a tempura soba (hot) for main. All of them were delicious, and regular size was pretty big. There is a huge box where a soba chief makes soba noodles from scratch. It's kinda fun to watch how they make soba noodles while we are eating it. Service was attentive and friendly. My tummy is satisfied.
Camilla F.}Manhattan, NY}7}59}48}-1}4}11/14/2014}Best soba in the city , no doubt about that! Love this place :)
Susan H.}New York, NY}7}19}19}-1}2}11/12/2014}I went here around 5:30pm and asked for a table for 3. The lady told us it should be 40-45 minutes wait, but it ended up being 1.25 hrs! I ordered the nabeyaki udon. I advise you do not order this. The ratio of noodles and broth was off and the noodles were overcooked. The tempura was already fully soaked in the soup, which made me really sad. There were only a couple of pieces of tiny chicken in it and almost no veggies. Not even close to avg nabeyaki udon. I guess the place is not called Udon-ya afterall!
Juan J.}Brooklyn, NY}106}705}187}18}4}11/10/2014}Soba-ya is a ya!  Authentic Japanese soba and noodle shop, serves them hot or cold.  The lunch bento box is a steal and will make you feel full (unlike many other Japanese places).  Ya, I will come back to Soba-ya!
Lijuan L.}Manhattan, NY}4}3}0}-1}2}11/9/2014}Just so so in terms of a lot of high quality Japanese restaurant in NYC. Not worth of waiting.
Ryan V.}Tustin, CA}7}6}0}-1}4}11/6/2014}Loved itComing from California where Sushi and fish is as fresh as you can get it, I have found my go to Japanese Spot in New York. I had their chopped Salmon and avocado over rice bowl and a side of Soba and it was delicious. The Salmon tasted really fresh and their rice was on point.  I like their soba since it wasn't the harsh buckwheat flavor you normally get at other Soba spots in NY. Definitely worth a try if your in the lower part of Manhattan.
Angela W.}Manhattan, NY}223}158}65}-1}4}11/6/2014}Popped in here late afternoon last Sunday and ordered their lunch set special, which runs on weekends (big plus!!) and is an absolute steal for the quantity and quality of food you get.  For around $15 you get a mini rice bowl, hot or cold soba, along with several small side dishes.  Even though they advertise the rice bowl as "mini", it was a good amount and there were a ton of options to choose from.  They also have a lunch box set which comes with more items and is $17, but the orders are limited to 25 a day so we came too late to snag one of those.  I opted for the chicken oyako-don (chicken and egg over a bed of rice) and my boyfriend got the katsu-don (deep fried chicken and egg over rice) and both were delicious!  Despite having "soba" in the restaurant name, we actually thought the rice bowls were much yummier.  We got our soba hot though since the weather has gotten pretty chilly, so perhaps their cold soba is better...I'll have to come back and see!Overall, Soba-ya is a solid spot in the East Village and an especially good alternative for when you go to Ippudo (just a few blocks away) and find out that the wait is 2h+.
Mimi V.}Elk Grove, CA}307}617}811}18}4}11/5/2014}Yum! Authentic fresh Japanese noodles. I came here on a full stomach because i knew i wouldn't be able to eat it any other day so i dragged my boyfriend here with me and i ordered the lunch combo that includes a rice bowl and bowl of noodles. As full as i was already, i still stuffed my mouth and enjoyed every bite of the noodles! The udon noodles was so fresh and the soup broth was tasty. i wish i would've had an empty stomach when i came, nevertheless, i still enjoyed the food. The ambiance felt as if i was in Japan. I loved the decor and the service was very friendly.
Josh Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}21}1}-1}2}11/5/2014}I come here at least twice a week for a couple of months now. But The portion of cod fish I got today was minuscule, literally half the size of what I usually get. Also, the chawanmushi is tasteless so try to avoid it.
Jessica K.}Bridgeport, CT}10}37}5}-1}5}11/4/2014}Delicious, authentic Japanese soul-food.This place (as least as far as I can tell with my...ahem...Western palate), is as authentic and as delicious as it gets. Every single item we've had here has been delicious-  from the hot sobas, down to the plum-wine mimosa (ask for it!). The hot soba (with additions of course: mushrooms, shiso, etc) is absolutely crave-worthy. Often, you can watch one of the chefs roll and cut fresh soba noodles, which is fun to watch and adds to the atmosphere. We stop by whenever we're in the area! Highly recommended.
Fanny Y.}Oakland, CA}25}42}12}-1}5}10/26/2014}The service was great and they were attentive and friendly.  The soba was fresh and there are so many options.  We had the salmon roe and mori cold soba.  The mushroom tempura was pretty good and the salmon and amberjack sashimi were good. Sake selection is a bit limited but you go there for the soba! Everything else is just secondary.
Donna M.}New York, NY}88}82}52}-1}3}10/24/2014}The soba is great - had the salmon and ikura don. The skin on my sashimi was left on the salmon so it was very tough and unpleasant to chew and swallow.. Service is also super efficient. My main reservation is that it's really overpriced..
Elaine W.}Flushing, NY}85}195}310}-1}4}10/22/2014}I've been here twice. The first time I came here, which was a few years ago, I remember having an excellent experience. (I also thought I made a review about it the first time I went, I guess not!)Went in at about 12:30. There wasn't really anyone in front of us, but we had to wait 15 minutes, which was fine. While waiting, more people were showing up, so good timing for us. At the entrance, there's a little foundation with the bamboo that goes up and down. And I'm assuming off hours, they have a little area where they made the soba noodles. No one was making at the time we went (but I did see it the first time I came to Soba-ya). We sat down and they gave hot towels for our hands. Our waitress was pretty busy so I had to flag her down, letting her know we were ready to order. We ordered the shrimp shumai, the sea urchin app, and the tempura. I ordered the oyster hot soba, which is a seasonal dish. After ordering apps, my friend suggested getting a sake. I don't really know a lot about sake (or alcohol in general, really). So we ask our waitress her recommendation. We asked which one had a sweeter taste and she gave a few choices. We ended up getting the kuroizumi sake. Which was okay for me. The food overall was good. I felt like I waited too long for my hot soba too cool down before taking a bite, because I felt the soba overcooked or very slightly soggy. In any case, the oysters itself retained it's flavor. The flavors of the oysters didn't go into the broth, which I thought was amazing cause the oysters by itself tasted very good. Overall, I had a lovely experience here. I would come back again for some cold soba next time and a dessert. Beware of time, because they close for lunch. Also, there isn't a lot of space for large groups. So, best to have a group of 4 at most.
Ninja h.}New York, NY}0}229}250}-1}4}10/20/2014}It was a long wait on a Saturday night. We were told 30 minutes but it was closer to an hour.  The food was delicious and the waitress was polite and helpful. It's a tight squeeze next to other dining parties but hey it's NYC. The price and quality of the food was very good. The decor was clean and tastefully done with the inside mostly clad in wood and paper shoji screen walls. Of course, they have a sushi bar with a dining  capacity for about 50 patrons with booths and small tables that can be moved together or separated to accommodate varying sized groups. They had a large selection of sake. Give this place a try when your craving some hot noodle soup, sushi, or tempura...you won't be disappointed!
Christine C.}Manhattan, NY}19}79}1}-1}5}10/19/2014}Excellent service and delicious food!Came around 1pm on a Sunday, was told it would take around 10-20 min for 2. Timing was on the spot. They asked us if we would mind bar seating, which we didn't mind. They asked again before we seated, making sure it was ok with us. Simply superb service. We got our drinks quickly and ordered the ten don and sake oyako don wih hot soba mini lunch set.It took awhile for our food to come out (even though we didn't notice it...). The server came back twice to apologize for the long wait, and on the second time even gave us some edamame for free. They also refilled our water pretty frequently.The food itself was excellent as well. My brother loves shrimp tempura, he said it was one of the best in NYC. The Sake Oyako don was a lot of food even if it says it's "mini" lunch set! The fish was fresh and the soba/broth was excellent. The small side dishes in the set was wonderful as well.Definitely would come back again!
Kevin O.}New York, NY}0}2}1}-1}5}10/17/2014}Excellent service, amazing food, great atmosphere. Wait might be a bit long without a reservation.Service 5/5They have multiple waiters pacing back and forth that can take your order or just help you out in general. Never really have to wait around for service.Food 4.5/5I got the sliced duck hot soba. Broth was great, duck tender and juicy, soba had great texture. Don't let the duck sit for too long or it gets kinda ... Chewy? I got green tea creme brûlée which was amazing. Definitely recommend!I'd definitely come back again.
Jessica M.}New York, NY}308}48}38}18}4}10/17/2014}Dropped by around 9 in the evening and took bar seats without any waiting time.Got the zaru cold soba--delicious!! The soba itself was a smooth texture and the dipping sauce was savory without being too salty. After I finished the soba, the waitress gave me a pot of boiling water to make the sauce into a broth--also quite tasty.Made the mistake of ordering a small portion. Unless you're already half-full, definitely order AT LEAST the regular portion! Also, the soba entrees with more toppings tend to get pricier. Overall, friendly service and good soba. Looking forward to coming back to try more!
Steph C.}Brooklyn, NY}468}752}318}18}2}10/16/2014}Large parties beware! They can only seat tables of 6 on one side of the restaurant, and likely only one large party at a time. I found this out when I arrived at 7 and put my name down for a table for 6. In a span of 10 minutes, the waitress asked me at least 3 times when my friends would be arriving. Each time, she actually stood and watched me text my friends just to make sure I was contacting them. Good god, woman! Pressure much?At 7:11, I had to give up the table because other people had come in. And of course, my friends arrived literally a minute after they seated people at that table. Annoying but understandable. We managed to squeeze into a 4-person booth (good thing for petite Asians) so the wait wasn't as bad as it could have been. We all ordered bowls of hot soba noodles. I had the Kamo Nanban, which had slices of duck. The duck slices were harder and chewier than expected, but the flavor was delicious. Noodles were fine, but I've had better at other places. The broth was flavorful, but way too salty! It tasted like the dipping sauce that you get with cold soba, and it probably was. Are we actually supposed to drink that up like soup?The clencher of the evening, was that they charged ANOTHER table's order ON TOP of our bill. We caught it right before signing the receipt, but not before the card had been charged. We nearly paid $160 bucks when our actual bill was around $90! Major FAIL.
Erin Y.}Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY}2}37}2}-1}4}10/8/2014}I like their eel rice bowl the most. They got good soba, but I have to say they could really improve their lunch box, especially comparing to Hasaki which locates at the same street, their tempura and salmon in the lunch box aren't really great. I've been there too many time, and I found I've exhausted the choices I could have. It'd be great if they can have a bit more options for lunch special (other than different rice bowls in mini lunch set).
Sarah C.}New York, NY}276}754}24}18}5}10/3/2014}Thanks BDLee for introducing me to Soba-ya. I can't stop thinking about how delicious this meal was! We were going to see Tove Lo play Webster Hall and in search of sustenance beforehand. A 2+ hour wait at Ippudo was not going to happen, and Upstate seemed too small to risk trying. Soba-ya came through with two seats at the bar. We ordered: black cod, shiso leaf chicken fingers, tempura sweet potato, tempura mushroom and tempura shishito peppers, and a small bowl of cold soba noodles with uni.These were the best chicken fingers I've ever had. They're tempura fried and you dip them in green tea salt. Nom. The vegetables were so good and hot I burned the roof of my mouth. The uni was fresh and yummy. Everything tasted great with a dry, unfiltered sake.Also they have heated toilet seats.In conclusion, I miss living in the East Village.
Ro N.}New York, NY}83}2203}88}-1}3}9/29/2014}I can't remember what I got here, but I came here with W and W has came here before, but didn't remember.Just like I don't remember which soba I ordered either.This place is ridiculously busy, not sure why, since I didn't think my soba was life changing.
Charles C.}Forest Hills, NY}200}10}0}-1}3}9/28/2014}This place has its high's and low's.  Following the compliment sandwich, I will start with the good first, then go into the bad, and end with a good.  I liked the service here, the staff was smiling and courteous.  They made sure my cup was topped off frequently, and gave us warm towels to clean off before our meal.  However, for all the hype this place received, the food was only mediocre.  We had the kitsune and stamina noodle soups, they tasted fine.  However, it didn't have the wow factor that I was expecting.  It was good, but not spectacular for the price and wait time (over half an hour for dinner).  Otherwise, the setting was nice.
Noa B.}New York, NY}499}210}694}-1}4}9/25/2014Updatedreview}Definitely get the soba when you come here. It is so soft and fresh and you can get a really good lunch deal. I ordered the shrimp shumai ($8.50) for the appetizer. I had one piece and it was cold and my dad had a piece as well and confirmed it was also cold. We went it back and they brought a new one with the full 5 shumai pieces. It was super delicious. I ordered the Sake Oyako Don ($14) which is salmon sashimi (about 5 pieces) served over rice with salmon roe. It was so fresh and tasty and I really enjoyed it though I usually do not like roe for its salty. It came with a small appetizer dish which had three tiny tastings. The first was carrot and daikon with black sesame seeds. It was really good. The second was two pieces of lotus with a sweet-ish sauce. They were ok not my favorite. The third was Japanese sweet potato which was the best out of the three. It also came with a small plate of pickles which were good but nothing special. The special also came with soba (I picked hot) Super filling and really delicious. Would nightly recommend.
John L.}New York, NY}101}111}1}-1}4}9/21/2014}This place was recommended to me by a very food savvy cowoker as the best place in the city for soba noodles.  I never really gave much thought to how I felt about soba noodles, so I thought: 'Why not start at the top?'  When we arrived, the wait was a quick ten minutes, and the service was speedy and friendly!  I tried a small duck soba and a small tempura rice bowl.  Both were more than enough to fill me up, and the prices were very reasonable!  I would like to return to try some cold soba, so this place will stay on my list!
Annie N.}Brooklyn, NY}160}274}715}18}3}9/19/2014}Came here for my round two course last night because the omakase and the sushi we ordered from a nearby japanese restaurant left us still hungry. My friend ordered the uni soba and we each got the steamed egg with mushroom and chicken appetizer and shared a cold sesame tofu. My friend said the uni soba was really good but suggest getting a small (it comes in different sizes) because the consistency of the japanese yam, the uni and the soba is good ONLY if you have a small portion. (gets too gooey if you order too big of a portion)The cold sesame tofu was... bland and definitely not a favorite of mine we each took a small bite and left it there.. i guess i was expecting a softer more silky texture for the tofu..and this was definitely not silky or soft. Steamed egg with mushroom and chicken was decent, you get a tiny portion of steamed eggs with a small chunk of chicken and a tiny mushroom on top for $9, the flavor tasted like bland msg soup.. i wasn't sure what i was expecting but this did not meet my expectations.I forgot to mention earlier we tried one item from their special menu the uni jelly-like thing... (SKIP IT) it was weird i thought it would be like jello with uni on top instead its like frozen soup that turned gelatinous with three peices of uni in it... the flavor was a bit salty for my preference...Pros: we didnt have to wait long for a tableCons: probably would have been better off getting takoyaki (more affordable and  would have definitelly tasted better)
H Z.}Brooklyn, NY}0}10}0}-1}2}9/14/2014}Actually, the food would be one-star, but the ambiance and setting bumps it up to two stars.  Which is a huge letdown from what the reviews had led me to believe.  I went here for dinner, ready to love the place from the reviews I'd read.  When we sat down, I loved the decor, and I looked the presentation of the soba bowl.  Everything fell apart with the first bite, though.  The "broth" was like watered-down soy sauce, just salty with a tang to it, and none of the texture I usually expect from a noodle place.  I was in an even easier-to-please mood too... I came in starving for dinner, after only eaten a banana all day.  And I still couldn't eat more than half -- that's how bad I thought it was.  Also had the duck appetizer, and was not impressed.  Tough and salty.On top of all that, it's pricey for what it is.  I'd much rather stop at any divey noodle place than come here again.  That said, great decor and good service.
Melissa C.}Seattle, WA}111}610}230}18}4}9/13/2014}Soba-ya came highly recommended by my friends. I got the chirashi cold soba on their suggestion. The difference between the regular and the large portion is that you just get more noodles with the large. I thought the regular was definitely enough.I normally love chirashi, but was apprehensive about the baby sardine tempura. It turned out to be delicious and my favorite part about the dish. Soba-ya is reasonably priced at $20 pp with tip for lunch. We got there when it opened at 12pm and noticed it filled up really quickly. There were a few parties waiting outside by the time we left too. Get here early if you want immediate seating!
Olivia L.}New York, NY}0}32}0}-1}5}9/9/2014}I really liked here. The place was nice and cozy. The servers are great. I tried the soba beer which was light and with nice wheat flavor. Had the una ju box with warm soba. I really liked the texture of their soba.
Judy S.}San Diego, CA}285}1001}1013}18}3}9/8/2014}I've always wanted to try out this place. Last time we came, the wait was a short 30m but we were way too hungry to wait any minutes, so we ended up choosing someplace else.When we got here, there was no wait if we were okay being seated at the bar. And luckily, we got a nice corner of the bar that was private and comfortable. The bartender (is that what you call him? the tea man? the waiter at the bar?) took our order. We asked about green tea, and got free Japanese green tea! (Usually it comes after the meal, but just ask and you get get it during/before.) The place is cozy and service was great!I ordered a Yasai with Duck, which was a hefty $20, and it barely had any duck. At this point I'm a little disappointed. Also, this could be personal preference, but I felt that the proportions were a tad off. My broth and dish had a little too many mushrooms. That scent just overtook the entire dish. The broth also tasted a little too strong and salty. And though it was sizeable, for $20, definitely not what I expected.I'd recommend Cocoron if you want soba. Maybe I'll come back again, but probably not.
Stephanie B.}New York, NY}9}23}22}-1}4}9/3/2014}Delicious spot for udon & their House-made buckwheat soba noodles! Kamo Namban (Duck), Chirashi (shrimp tempura, egg omelet, shitake mushroom, fried bean curd & fish cake) and their light, crispy Tempura varieties have all been very satisfying. Oyako Don (Fresh salmon sashimi & salmon roe) is delectable! Decor makes you feel like you're in Japan, but I wish the seating was more authentic.
Sharon K.}New York, NY}159}91}184}-1}4}8/31/2014}Cute little Japanese restaurant in the East Village. Kinda hard to miss since it's so small. But it's also easy to spot with a line of people waiting outside. Went on Sunday around lunch time and there was a 15-20 min wait which didn't really seem like it was that long. But the restaurant is small so it's better to wait outside (if weather permits).They have a good deal for lunch: the mini lunch set which comes with a rice bowl, noodles (cold/hot udon or cold/hot soba), and small side dishes. I had the sushi sashimi set with hot udon. Should've known not to order udon when the name of the restaurant has soba in it... udon wasn't that good. The soup just wasn't what I expected or wanted. But the sushi sashimi bowl was delicious! I asked for no salmon roe (fish eggs) and they gave me more sashimi!! Hehe.The waiters were really nice too! Definitely will go back and try the soba next time!
Zuzzi E.}New York, NY}188}551}17}-1}4}8/30/2014}Delicious soba, warm or cold. Menu is extensive and there's enough for carnivores or vegetarians. It's pretty busy on the weekend but you can easily get a seat during the week. They also have a great lunch special if you're in the 'hood!
Hong Kim L.}Bronx, NY}165}10}71}-1}5}8/30/2014}Delightful down to the last bite. A bestie foodie and I needed to cool off a sweaty summery night in late August. Cold soba noodles did the trick. The dessert itself was light and custardy. Went down smooth for a couple of non-sweet tooths. Two thumbs up.
Irene L.}Brooklyn, NY}146}52}585}-1}5}8/23/2014}The soba here is so delicious and authentic! The interior decorations really make you feel like your in Japan. I love sitting by the bar to interact with the cook.My favorite is definitely the duck soba.  The broth is always deep with layers of flavor, and the soba is silky and soft. Try pairing your meal with cold or hot soba tea, it has a very strong roasted flavor and pairs perfectly with your meal.
sammy s.}Cliffside Park, NJ}3}45}1}-1}3}8/23/2014}Zaru soba. Awesome. Hand made. Rare stuff . Whole buckwheat stuff.Nabeyaki udon i tries. Good enough. Fried shrimp good.
Great W.}New York, NY}0}101}0}-1}5}8/23/2014}Came here last Tuesday for a birthday dinner. We were pleasantly surprised that there was an early bird special. We had 2 orders of the special and another medium hot order of Kama-age. Service was superb! Our tea cups were refilled all the time. All ingredients were fresh and the establishment was clean.Can't wait to come back again!
Paul C.}New York, NY}76}434}350}-1}5}8/22/2014}Authentic, reasonable, good service and great lunch deals - it's got the lot. My favorite Japanese soba noodle spot by far.
Hatsumi T.}Floral Park, Queens, NY}94}182}478}-1}4}8/21/2014}3.5 Stars. This place is an authentic Japanese buckwheat noodle restaurant. They use buckwheat flour imported from Japan.When I went there for the first time, I ordered Early Bird Dinner Special $18. Only Mon - Thu from 5:30pm to 7:00pm. Here is the menu of Early Bird Special.    Assorted Appetizers    Tempura    Plain Soba or Udon (cold or hot)    Inari Sushi    Vannila Icecream with Strawberry SauceI though this was a good deal.At the second time, I went there for dinner on Friday. I ordered Yamakake cold soba. It was good, but I was still so hungry. I should have ordered large size. Japanese food portion is not so big in Japan, too. However, soba is main food, so it should be filling. Is that because my stomach is Americanized? Maybe. I ordered a set of Soba Manju and Green Tea Ice cream for dessert. Soba Manju is made of Soba flour and I think wheat flour is used, too. Sweet red bean paste was inside. Soba manju was warmed up and it was hot when it was served. After dessert, I became 80% full.I may be back there, but only for Early Bird Special.I saw they have variety of sake, so if you like sake, you may like this restaurant.
Elizabeth N.}Brooklyn, NY}185}601}245}18}4}8/19/2014}Great, fresh soba and a change from my usual sushi meals. They offer a lot of dinner choices and even early dinner sets of tempura. I opted for the chirashi soba which was yummy. It doesn't have any sushi though. The pork belly appetizer was also very good and tender. It came with a lot of pieces surprisingly. Dessert of milk tofu was also delicious.
Shinji S.}Hartsdale, NY}0}15}3}-1}4}8/18/2014}I went for a lunch and ordered Mini Tendon Set.  Decent volume and well presented.  I guess you can't go wrong with this place if you like real Japanese soba.  No gimmick  like many other Japanese restaurant in this very competitive area but very solid food.  Very pleasant service and the place is very clean and comfortable.  No surprise in good and bad ways.
Luc P.}Manhattan, NY}0}31}0}-1}5}8/18/2014}As far as I can tell this is the best soba noodle place in NYC. I try to avoid wheat (I can eat gluten but am gluten-sensitive). I'm not sure if these buckwheat noodles have some wheat but I felt fine afterwards. I've tried their lunch sets and have been impressed with the quality of food, relative to price. I've had the Chirashi cold soba noodle on the dinner menu and was very happy with it.
Max V.}Brooklyn, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}8/18/2014}Delicious food. Perfect service. Adequate prices.Now it's one of my favourite places!!! ^_______^
Lils Y.}Manhattan, NY}191}231}175}-1}3}8/17/2014}3.5 starsCame here on weekend for one of the lunch sets - plenty of seating, but the place started filling up around 1-1:30PM. Seating is also pretty cramped, so you literally are easedropping on your neighbor's convo.Lunch sets available with the large trays with entree plus small side dishes. FOOD:-Chicken Katsu Don lunch set with the hot soba - fried chicken with omelet over rice. I liked the chicken katsu, but wasn't feeling the soba. It was too soft in texture, and my BF felt the same. -Sake oyako don lunch set with cold soba- with salmon and salmon roe over rice. The small side dishes tasted OK - not that great, compared to OOTOYA closeby. Also the side dishes are tiny. In sum, pricey for what you pay.
Bob B.}Manhattan, NY}0}128}0}-1}3}8/9/2014}The plusses - the real deal in terms of Soba.  NYC is full of Ramen places - can't swing a cat without hitting two.  But a real Soba place that makes their own noodles is unique.  The menu is broad and well executed.  Starters delicious and sushi holds its own.  Of course the Soba is the focus and duck steals the show (but the variety impressive enough for everyone to find something unique). The minuses - had a bad service experience that has kept us away since.  Also, I prefer Udon and Ramen (but that's a personal preference).
Soo K.}Houston, TX}282}333}359}-1}3}8/6/2014}Interesting experience, but I'm still hungry!For photos visit sooandthecity.com!
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}4}8/6/2014}This place is pricey... until I got the meal! You really do get what you pay for hereI couldn't finish my portion. I got the lunch set with cold soba and tempura. Maybe next time I will opt for the mini lunch set. As I came before in the summer, I got the cold soba option. Maybe I like the hot noodles better. Either way, this place is very decent. If you are looking for quality food with an empty stomach, this is the place to go. High recommended for soba lovers.
Lama B.}Brooklyn, NY}230}592}50}-1}5}8/4/2014}As many reviews as there are for Soba-ya I'm not that useful here. That said, I just have to tell the universe how grateful I was for the amazingly delicious lunch we had here.  Nelly and I sampled eel, uni, tuna, hot soba, cold soba, and pickles.  Yes it seems like a lot of food, but being that everything is so lightly prepared, so perfectly seasoned, one cannot help but enjoy every savory bite of goodness.  I highly recommend coming here for Saturday lunch.  We waited for five minutes really because we came at 2:30 PM.  Amazing food.  Just amazing.
Shulin T.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}22}238}402}18}4}8/3/2014}I got a cold uni soba and added ikura to it. Everything Was spot on, from the freshness of the uni and ikura to the texture of the grated yam and soba. A definite winner in the city.
CJ G.}Carle Place, NY}2}3}0}-1}5}8/3/2014}Went during lunch with 3 friends on a weekday. Customer service was awesome:  I was early and the person up front said that all parties must be present before I can be seated. She was nice enough to tell me to let her know if everyone in my party arrived.  When they did, she seated us right away.Food was delicious!  This was one of the freshest and savory seafood I've ever been too.  The soba was also freshly made and satisfying.  I feel like I'm in cloud nine while I eat and enjoy the food. Price: Reasonable (for lunch) I will return and bring more friends.Note: The place is very quaint and small.. It's an intimate setting so perfect for a small group or even for a date :)
Sherra L.}Brooklyn, NY}336}192}577}18}3}8/2/2014}Came here last night with a friend for dinner. It was my first time having cold soba and I was quite sure how I would like it but a ways, have it a try! I ordered the small 100g size cold soba with fried chicken! When the order arrived, I was shocked on how little amount of food was included for almost a $15 price! The noodle was literally like half a bag of a noodle cup, and the fried chicken was literally soaked in the soup on the side which made it soggy! I was totally not amused but this plate. Not only that, but I was still starving after the meal and I'm not even someone who eats a lot to be filled up. I guess this was not what I was looking towards to.
Terrence L.}Manhattan, NY}169}205}185}-1}4}7/29/2014}Went in alone on Sunday evening looking for a quick bite after working out and I got seated in a minute! Pretty sure you have to wait if you have a group, but it's nothing unreasonable (15-30 mins)I ordered Tempura Soba and Green Tea, and everything came within 10mins. The broth in which the soba was served in was absolutely delicious! It was all sorts of umami. The tempura however, was a different story. The prawns were limp, and the vegetables (Shiso leaf & pepper) weren't battered right. Pretty sure everything was fried ahead of time. But all in all, this is a decent place to get some noodles, and I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the Soba with uni and mountain yam!
Noelle T.}Chicago, IL}3}5}0}-1}5}7/29/2014}Sobaya is my go to brunch, lunch, linner and dinner spot.  And why..??GENERAL:Though there may be small wait (at any of the above eating times), I promise it's worth it.  It's a smaller seating area where you may hear the convo next to you, but cozy enough to catch up with a friend and enjoy a generous portion of soba!  And, lastly, if you walk into a place and it's full of asian/Japanese people, you know it has to be authentic (and hopefully delicious too.. it is!)FOOD:My tip to you: go for lunch with a friend and order any of the mini-lunch sets, enlarge the soba side (cold, obviously) for $3.50 extra and then share the regular size entree.  My personal favorite entrees/mini-lunch sets: Sake Oyako Don (very generous serving of fresh salmon sashimi and salmon roe over rice), Unagi Don (Eel), Tuna Steak Don and the Chicken Oyako don (Chicken and Egg) all over rice!  The Unagi and Seared Tuna are a bit bigger than the salmon oyako don, but if you're craving Salmon.. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!  I often order uni on the side to add a bit of extra flavor to my rice, but its definitely a nice to have and not mandatory.I have eaten the above three as staples to my Manhattan diet for the last year or so - go try it, get hooked, and go back! :P
Ella V.}Auckland, New Zealand}2}26}1}-1}4}7/24/2014}Went here as I was craving some authentic soba noodles....was not disappointed at all. I got the broiled eel mini lunch set with cold  soba noodles. The eel was absolutely delicious and is one of my new obsessions. The soba noodles were comparable to those that I had in Japan! My friend ordered the Raw Tuna and Mountain Yam cold soba- he enjoyed it, the tuna had a slight fishy flavor... The sesame spinach was alright. Awesome ambience, the waiter staff are super friendly, a little Japanese restaurant tucked into the East Village! Also tried the Honey and Wasabi ice cream...not a big fan of wasabi at all but definitely try it if you love wasabi- not too spicy.
Maisha K.}Honolulu, HI}1}49}4}-1}4}7/23/2014}Yum!  I can be pretty picky when it comes to soba, but this place was quite good.We had the karaage, tempura zaru soba, stamina seiro, and manju with green tea ice cream.The food: Everything was very delicious.  Karaage was a great start to the meal.  For the mains, the only thing I would have liked was for more variety in my tempura since it only came with shrimp, shiso leaf, and a pepper.  I have to say, though, the pieces of shrimp were nice and large and tasty.  I also tried a bite of the stamina seiro and that was quite good if you're looking for something a little less traditional.  Dessert topped off an excellent meal and I'm glad we went for it.  The green tea ice cream was more bitter than I expected, but it paired well with the azuki manju made with soba flour.We also had a citrusy cocktail which was very good.  It was on the pricey side, but perhaps worth a try for how good it was.  Probably would be able to make this for cheaper at home though.The service:  Very good.  Our waiter was very nice and my water was always topped off.  Overall:  This restaurant made me very happy and I would definitely return.  It's not the best soba I've had, but I got used to eating soba right after it was rolled and cut in small town Japan.  That said, it's pretty darn close to that small town Japan flavor I crave.
Debra T.}Houston, TX}585}864}2130}18}4}7/17/2014}Perfect place for your uni & soba noodz lover.Uni Tororo (Grated Mountain Yam) was my absolute favorite.
Dana H.}Flushing, Queens, NY}12}145}39}18}4}7/14/2014}First time coming here with a friend, and I got the Tuna Steak Don Mini Lunch Set. My total came out to be around $14, and it was totally worth it! The Tuna was delicious, it melts in your mouth and it's a completely new taste. The rice was slightly sweet and salty making it the perfect combination. The soba was delicious as well. It's handmade, so it had the perfect consistency. The soup that came along with the soba would be mixed with a type of soup and you would drink it afterwards. It was a good palette cleanser. The service was amazing. They were very attentive and the food was placed in a simple manner. Although it was slightly crowded when we arrived, they didn't rush us and we stayed for a good hour. Great place to go to!
Susanna L.}Brooklyn, NY}130}218}97}18}4}7/14/2014}What can I say??!?! Truly delicious jam packed lunch. Moving back to NY I was craving soba noodles and came upon this gem. I ordered the tuna mini lunch box and let me say it is not so mini at all!!! The box comes with a small dish of soba noodles, some tuna sashimi with rice and fish eggs and some little side dishes. So delicious!! The fish was so fresh I wish I had gotten more. Kinda makes me wonder what a full size lunch box is.Also had the mango pudding dessert. Oh boy it was bursting with great flavors. Great presentation as well. I would def come back here in a heartbeat.
Vivian Z.}Brooklyn, NY}426}39}10}-1}3}7/10/2014}It was a disgustingly hot day so my roommates and I decided to get some cold soba noodles for dinner. We came here around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table for 4. I ordered the roasted duck soba noodles (regular size), and my roommates got another one of the same, the tuna sashimi soba, and uni soba. We also ordered the pork belly for appetizer. The pork belly came fairly quickly and was yummy - flavorful, tender, and a sizable portion for $10.Our soba noodles took forever to arrive...we waited about 35-40 minutes from the time we ordered to when we finally received our food. The soba noodles were the perfect consistency, and the bowl with the soup, scallions, and roasted duck paired deliciously with it. They give you a pot of hot water to pour into the bowl once you're finished with the noodles so that you have a nice warm bowl of soup to enjoy, but I was so full after finishing my soba that I didn't drink much of it. The duck was a little bit too chewy, but well flavored. All in all, this place was good, but I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. I personally didn't think the wait (both to be seated and for our food to arrive) was worth it, and it was also pretty pricey. For my regular size order it was I think around $17. I will probably hunt around for some other soba/udon places to try.
Jisun L.}New York, NY}3}5}10}-1}4}7/6/2014}If you are looking for a slightly more upscale (and pricier) restaurant around St. Marks, then I would suggest this place. My boyfriend and I stumbled across soba ya after searching for somewhere to eat with a sanitation grade higher than a B (not being picky or snobbish, just a bad experience eating at a B restaurant, never again!) Anyways I ordered the Ikura Oroshi which is the cold soba noodles with salmon roe and radish in the large size. My bf got the nabeyaki udon and the salmon and roe rice bowl. The meals were pretty satisfying, considering that I got the largest size.Overall experience: good food, traditional style Japanese restaurant, and it wont take a load off of your wallet for the quality.
Wenyen H.}Gaithersburg, MD}193}56}0}-1}5}7/3/2014}Very nice shop, although the size of its noodles are a bit too small regarding American size, but the taste is nice. I ordered Uni soba, it was so good, Uni was so fresh and sweet! Wonderful experience
Lucy M.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}1}-1}5}7/3/2014}We walked in around 3 PM on a weekday. They had no problem accommodating us for a late lunch, and even though it was so close to closing time, the staff was very attentive and didn't make us feel rushed.I ordered the Tuna-Steak Don set with hot soba noodles, and it was delicious! I'm no expert, but the soba was definitely comparable to what I've had in Japan, and the best I've had in the city. The tuna steak was very flavorful and perfectly cooked. It is served with a tasty garlic sauce on top of a small bowl of sushi rice.For dessert, I tried the green tea brulée. The green tea flavor wasn't very strong, which I thought was perfect since I'm not a huge fan of green tea anyway, but if you are, this might be slightly disappointing.All in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back for more!
Joyce C.}Manhattan, NY}205}44}56}-1}3}6/26/2014}although the ambience and decor seems more upscale than the usual restaurants around st marks, i found their food to be a bit underwhelming. i came here on two occasions:first time i came for lunch and ordred the Tuna-Steak Don from their lunch menu. it was actually a really well portioned amount of food: seared slices of tuna, a small rice bowl & small noodles, your choice of soba or udon. i really enjoyed the tuna steak, and it was really fun to watch as the noodles were being pulled  near the entrance of the restaurant. because of this experience, i returned again a second time several months later.came here again and ordered the regular sized salmon tartare don (spicy salmon and avocado over rice) this time. i was disappointed with the taste-- the salmon had a strange aftertaste and the avocado were a bit on the hard side. i prefer udon west's spicy salmon don much more. i finished with the soy milk pudding, which looked so cute and yummy. honestly, dessert was the best part of the meal for me.the portions were just too small to keep me satiated and the flavors were pretty bland. though i might be willing to give this place another try for its lunch menu, i don't see myself visiting often in the future.
Feifei F.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}21}9}53}-1}4}6/25/2014}I like they use alcohol to reduce the fishiness  of salmon. The small appetizers come with the meal is pretty good that u can feel the thoughtfulness of the chef using rosemaries to lighten up the original taste of each food ingredients.
Kate M.}Manhattan, NY}0}24}0}-1}5}6/24/2014}I always love this place but lately find out when you go for the lunch time, "Soba" is extremely fresh and even better than many soba place in Japan. I took my mother a few days ago and she was surprised how this restaurant offer you a great Soba, just like a quality soba place in Japan.  I like their choice of menu, my favourite is cold soba such as "Mori"with Uni side and "Butano kakuni" ( Pork belly ). The food is very fresh and staffs are always welcoming.
Jennifer K.}Chicago, IL}22}10}0}-1}5}6/20/2014}This is the place to get your zaru soba fix. We were seated immediately as a party of 2 on a Sunday at 1PM.Uni Tororo - I'm a fan of natto, and I'm also a fan of uni. This dish was delicious.Ten Zaru Shrimp, Shiso and Shisito Tempura - The shiso tempura was interesting, although I'm not sure if it retains the shiso taste. Overall, I was very happy this dish.After we finished, the waiter came by and offered something I couldn't understand. I said yes, and he brought out a square, wooden teapot. You take the contents of the teapot, which turned out to be broth/stock, and pour it into your leftover zaru soba dipping sauce. This soup was a tasty end to the meal.
Harue J.}Manhattan, NY}12}261}31}18}4}6/17/2014}I usually come here for lunch.  It can feel crowded depending on the time, especially at dinner time with tables placed very close together.  Their soba is very good, house-made soba.  I enjoy their simple, understated vibe and good soba with no frills.
Benjamin C.}New York, NY}61}109}2}-1}4}6/14/2014}Traditional, simple, Japanese and flavor.  This is what you come for and this what you get. Ramen is over rated and over priced. Let's make way for the age of soba!!!
Hoang D.}Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY}160}104}2}-1}4}6/14/2014}I'm indeed a fan. Wasn't impressed the first time I ate here but after the second time I was hooked. I usually like to order an order of salmon sashimi, a cold soba with some shrimp tempura. I added a lot of wasabi and scallion on the dipping sauce and I thought they taste great every time I was there. A long wait is the only thing that I'm complaining though.
Mel T.}New York, NY}381}1068}2396}18}3}6/12/2014}If you're planning to come to Soba-ya, I hope you're also planning to leave hungry.I came in on a Tuesday at around 6:30 with three of my pals. There was no wait. We were seated immediately and there were still some empty tables left. But after we ordered, the place was filled and there were a bunch of people waiting to be seated. I heard the wait times here can get crazy so try to come early!I already knew I wanted to try their cold noodles because I wanted to try their dipping sauce to see what the fuss was all about. So I ordered the medium-sized stamina seiro (fried chicken & garlic in hot dipping sauce). After I tried it, I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong - it was good but I guess I was just expecting to taste something that I haven't tasted before. Also, the fact that the chicken was about the size of a chicken tender - doesn't exactly help its case. I thought I was getting at least a chicken cutlet or something! I mean come on! AND the chicken tasted like it was 2 days old.And that's exactly why I left feeling hungry.I may or may not have headed over to Mark afterwards to get myself a slider.Hey! A girl's gotta eat right?
Brian T.}New York, NY}5}12}4}-1}3}6/10/2014}Ok. They make the buckwheat soba noodle on site. That's something plus if dipping sauce taste good.However, the dipping sauce of cold soba was somewhat flat to me.I personally can judge it because I have had some soba in Japan over the years, and soba is one of my favorite summer dish.It was clean and well maintained.I would have to say that it is not family friendly place because I was not allowed to bring a stroller inside.I had to park my stroller at the entrance of the restaurant, and hold my sleeping baby inside.I don't think it's Japanese culture, but it's them being very strict.
Sarah H.}New York, NY}18}233}3}18}2}6/6/2014}Okay honestly unless you are the greatest food snob in the entire world, you will be able to only notice a tiny difference in the handmade soba noodles with the nicer soba noodles you find in the Asian grocery store. Learn how to boil those dried noodles properly and it will taste just as good. As others have mentioned, it is very salty. Like jeez, what is the deal with all these Japanese noodle places making everything so salty these days?! The broth was nothing special and I have actually tasted equally good prepared soup bases. It's also expensive. Not worth the trek.
Han Y.}Los Angeles, CA}103}228}78}18}5}6/1/2014}Health Grade: AI've recently been addicted to soba and this place has so many options. I came with a group of 7 around 6pm on a Saturday night and we were immediately seated. I think that may have been lucky because I've been here a few times and by 6, there's usually a wait already, so definitely come early. I usually order a large (200g) Nameko Oroshi or other cold dipping soba and it's perfectly enough for me although may be too big for someone who doesn't like soba as much as I do. I've also had their lunch special where I got the salmon oyako don and soba. The soba was awesome as usual but I'd say their salmon was average. The service was wonderful though and they brought out what I needed quickly. They also give out the soba yu afterwards which is a nice finishing touch.
Hayoung B.}New York, NY}21}25}51}-1}4}5/30/2014}I love eating at this place!! They have such fresh sushi, great rice bowls and soba/udon. I love how everything you eat doesn't go to waste. They bring in the soba broth to mix in with your soba sauce. You can't go wrong eating here. Just pick anything off the menu and it won't disappoint!
Alyssa T.}New York, NY}147}202}0}-1}4}5/27/2014}Finally got a chance to try Soba-ya! Dinner service starts at 5:30pm and we came a little before 6pm, right before the throng of hungry dinner time peeps. When you enter the restaurant, you're immediately greeted with a very CLEAN and AUTHENTIC feel. Wave hi to the man in the glass box who's making fresh soba! Decor is EARTHY and MINIMALIST and SERVICE is IMPECCABLE. The WAITERS are KNOWLEDGABLE about the menu and give their RECOMMENDATIONS. I'm glad there were blind-like partitions between tables because it gave my party some privacy. **the MENU is EXTENSIVE so take your time to consider everything!!BUTA KAKUNI--GENEROUS portion for an APPETIZER. The pork was TENDER but I wish the stew was more saturated/rich.  Just my preference, I'm sure it wasn't meant to be that way. The contrast with the cold EGG YOLK was interesting to taste.AGEDASHI TOFU--the CONSISTENCY of the tofu was SPOT ON (lightly crisp and silky on the inside) and the BROTH was SALTY and FLAVORFUL. SHISO SASAMI--strayed from my usual tatsuta age and I'm glad I did! The chicken was so TENDER (boiled maybe?) and it was fried perfectly. The shiso leaf and green tea salt really enhanced the flavor of the chicken. GET ON THAT GREEN TEA SALT!!KAMO SEIRO--AL DENTE soba noodles by themselves were so FRESH and the RIGHT THICKNESS. I got the SMALL size (there's also regular and large) and it was the PERFECT PORTION size (you'll be satisfyingly full but could down a dessert to top it off haha). The dipping sauce had about 5-6 pieces of DUCK. The DUCK was a good chewy and with the FAT ATTACHED. **I WOULD RECOMMEND this place for an authentic experience!!FYI COME EARLY OR ELSE THE CROWD GETS THICK
Seon M.}Los Angeles, CA}34}122}228}18}4}5/26/2014}I came here on Memorial Day. This place was packed!!! Hand made soba. Food was good here. Quick service. I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu next time I visit nyc!
Jane Qian W.}Oakland Gardens, Queens, NY}9}9}5}-1}2}5/25/2014}I came with my boyfriend because we saw high ratings for this place on Yelp. We had fun there but the food was not as impressive as on the reviews. The  only thing that impressed me was that the food is healthy. ....the hot Soba noodles i got were in a clear soup with some fresh spinach and one piece of fish cake. I spent 8 bucks on a tiny portion of steamed egg, so tiny that i could finish it with two bites. It was not as good as the one i made at home....We waited about 15 minutes for the seats, and the waitress was friendly. I'm glad I came here for the experience, however I most likely won't visit here again.
Mary O.}Houston, TX}97}226}2418}18}4}5/24/2014}This place is known for their soba noodles, but I just wanted their dessert. The milk jelly was so good and refreshing. It was topped with a strawberry and piece of mint. I also had the soba sushi, which was shrimp tempora wrapped with soba noodles (instead of rice), wrapped in seaweed paper and dunked in soba broth. It tasted okay and kind of pricy at $10 for 5 pieces.
David W.}Flushing, NY}52}73}4}-1}4}5/11/2014}It is my first time trying Japanese soba noodle, so I can't determine if it is typical, but it  looks as same as in Japanese Gourmet shows. The noodle is really resilient. However it is tasteless, I ordered Zaru, cold Soba noodle with little bit seaweed, and the seaweed taste totally covered noodle, However, the soba dip source is great, seems mixing with plum Juice, so tasty.
Yong K.}Manhattan, NY}568}458}124}18}4}5/10/2014}came for lunch and like the name says, SOBA was really good!we were a group of 4 and it wasn't packed that day maybe because it was a thursday. food:-udon - solid! good broth, not too salty (i really don't like it if the udon is too salty)-one of the lunch specials came with a side of salmon sashimi which was really pretty fresh- soba - definitely the highligh t fo this place for me. the noodle texture was great and the broth was good too. i got it cold, but i think you could get it hot too. i recommend this place for good soba!
Jason H.}Manhattan, NY}534}379}2}18}4}5/10/2014}Came here for lunch.  It was not crowded when we arrived (around 12:15) but began to get crowded when we left (around 1).  So come early!  They don't take reservations.We ordered both a mini lunch box and a full lunch set.  For the mini lunch box, you have to order the main dish - we chose the tuna tekkadon (that may be redundant, whatever).  For the lunch set, it seems they make a limited quantity every day (similar to other japanese restaurants) and you don't choose anything - it's a prix-fixe.  For both, we got to choose noodles (soba/udon) and temperature for the noodles (hot/cold).  We chose a cold soba and a cold udon.First the tekkadon mini-lunch box.  The pickled vegetables were nice, but the real star was the tuna and rice.  The rice was very good with the sauce - warm and sticky.  The tuna was nicely seared and rare in the middle, very tasty and perfect with the rice.Next, the lunch set.  I think the special was salmon today - it came with a very nice salmon, that had a great subtle herb scent.  The pickled vegetables were good here, too, especially with the nice sticky rice with roe.  The salad on the side was fine, nothing spectacular.  It also came with some well-fried shrimp tempura and a jalapeno (or some pepper) tempura (it wasn't very spicy, and was good).The noodles were all good, with a slight preference for the soba noodles.  A touch less than al dente, and went well with the rest of the food.  And, because it was pretty warm out, that they were cold was a good choice.The lunch set was finished with soba-yu in a box - a fishy-sort of water, presumably to cleanse your palate.  I was not fond, but I guess it's traditional.  The lunch set ended with a very sweet strawberry custard - very light, and sweet.  It's not quite a custard, it's more like a thin tofu.  It was good.All of this we ate along with some good matcha tea.  I found this to be a great accompaniment to the food, and a better palate cleanser than the soba-yu.The decor was nice - very traditional Japanese - and the service was fast and friendly.All told, our meal was about $40.  It was a good price, I think, for the quality and amount.  So yeah, pretty nice.  It's a nice contrast to the craziness of St. Mark's just a block over.
Jessica H.}Concourse, Bronx, NY}17}10}4}-1}1}5/6/2014}They've got great price and soba, but my experience today is extremely disappointing. I ordered a mini lunch set (cold soba+ salmon don) as usual, and just when I was about to finish my salmon don, I found three pieces of weirdly colored (as picture shown) salmon sashimi. I asked the waiter and explained my concerns that they might not be fresh. At first he took a quick look and said it's the fatty area that is sometimes left on the salmon. I've been eating sushi since I can remember, and have had first handed experience with almost every kind of freshly cut salmon sashimi (in Japan and Taiwan, and have certainly seen the salmon sashimi with fat attached he said), but never had I seen something like this before. For my insistence, the waiter finally took it to the kitchen and returned briefly with the same salmon (except being poked here and there) and said that it's due to the heat of the white rice it is white. Funny how the side of the salmon that is on the rice is pink while the side facing up is white/ grayish. Sobaya was once my favorite, but with this kind of service and sashimi, this could be considered scandalous.
Angeline C.}Brooklyn, NY}60}578}231}18}4}5/3/2014}I was craving for some salmon and salmon roe and this place was it!The place is a bit small so either come on an off day or during non-peak hours.  They also have an early bird dinner special that is until 7pm.Now I know this place is known for their soba, but we didn't come here for the soba.  I've had it before, but a long time ago and never did a review on that so I'll need to come back and do a review on the soba.We ordered - Sake Oyako Don (Sliced Salmon Sashimi And Salmon Roe Over Rice) - this was delicious!  The sliced salmon was very fresh and the salmon roe was delicious.  I recommend this dish if you like this type of thing.Nebeyaki - this was delicious as well.  The udon and broth wasn't too heavy or salty and everything complimented each other really well.  Mushroom tempura - I love tempura anything and never had mushroom tempura so we decided to try it.  It was an assortment of mushrooms and it was so good!  I recommend this dish if you are a mushroom + tempura fan.Shiso Sasami  (Chicken Tenders Wrapped in Shiso Leaf, Served w/Green Tea Salt) - This dish was good, but it was nothing special.  I liked dipping the chicken in the green tea salt however and thought that was pretty fun.  I'd skip this and try their other appetizers though.  Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and I'd come back.  Give this place a shot if you are in the mood for some soba.
Agustin K.}New York, NY}703}1004}441}18}3}5/3/2014}With the abundant Japanese options in little Tokyo or midtown, I think Sobaya slipped from its position in my top 10 favorite japanese list.They do offer a variety of toppings in the soba menu, all served cold/dry or hot/broth, in different sizes.  None of the toppings screamed at me so I ended up ordering the chirashi since it offers the most variety.I used to like ordering the dry since they come will come with the soba hot water to pour at the end of my meal and I can enjoy the hot version at the end.  The soba itself, I can't really say if it's that much better from other ones I've had. The so a water came room temperature.  Certainly not freshly drawn.  It could have been a great meal, but instead it was just an average meal.They also offered rice dishes if you're not a fan of soba.Service, they rush you.  But if not the waiters, be prepared for the waiting patrons eyeing on your table once you slurped your last piece of noodle.  Be ready to eat and leave immediately when you're done.
Risca P.}Elmhurst, NY}183}116}92}-1}4}5/1/2014}Came here with a regular who knows the right stuff to order and wasn't being stingy about getting different plates. I was fortunate to try a good number of their small plates: omelette, shrimp shumai, Goma tofu, and a few others that I can't remember. I enjoyed the appetizers, especially the omelette. Soft and delicious. Can't say that I enjoyed the soba but I don't think it's fair to say that it was because of the restaurant. I am not a huge soba fan. I prefer ramen all the way. To me, soba is just bland unless you pour the sauce on the side that it comes with. I did like my duck slices, though. They were yummy. I would much prefer to pair my duck with a bowl of ramen noodles. In any case, service was good. It would have been helpful if the restaurant had two restrooms because it got crowded and it was not pleasant having to wait in line near the entrance because that is where the restroom is located. Not a big deal, but it was something that caught my attention. I am not swearing off soba altogether. I'd like to give it another chance but perhaps at another spot.
Audrey T.}Manhattan, NY}32}228}13}-1}4}4/30/2014}Soba-ya is a great little restaurant for fine-quality soba dishes, and other home-made style small Japanese dishes. If you are a fan of noodles (obviously in particular, of soba noodles), this place is for you! I am a diehard noodle lover, so this place was right up my alley. Line-ups are expected almost all the time, but luckily things can move quite fast. The hostess and servers were efficient and professional, and nice! (That's always a plus.) I read on Yelp that they do not take reservations. Not a huge problem, just went a little bit earlier and waited perhaps 15 minutes. Not too bad for NYC terms!The mains are divided into three general categories: cold soba, hot soba/udon soup, and don (rice). Some of the toppings are similar across the board, but what is great is the flexibility you get with the choice of carb and temperature. I would recommend trying out the basics, like cold zaru soba, and perhaps try others with more adventurous toppings. A good option would be to ask your waiter or waitress about their specialties or favourites.Prices range from $10 for a small dish (I think it would be too small for most people), all the way to $20 for a large, depending on the type of toppings. My regular size cold soba with tempera was a cool $16. Is it great bang for your buck? Probably not, for us cheapskates, but it was worth it this time for such good home-made style soba.Would I come back? Definitely!
Liz Y.}Brooklyn, NY}85}30}12}-1}5}4/29/2014}Food was great, had udon noodles it was delicious. By far my favorite Japanese place.
Lynn D.}Chicago, IL}2}39}1}-1}3}4/26/2014}If I got a different dish, my experience may have been better.  The soba noodle itself was very good, it tasted fresh.  I'm a fan of freshly made noodles and pasta.  I got the small Ten Zaru.  I thought we were ordering appetizers, so I got the smaller size.  But I missed the part where we passed on ordering it because the appetizers came in small portions.  I didn't really know how to eat my dish.  The items came on a separate dish.  Soy sauce, noodles, cilantro/scallions, shrimp tempura.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to mix them together or dip the tempura or the noodles in the soy sauce.  Maybe some instruction would be nice.  Towards the end of my meal, the waitress brought me a clear broth that was kind of bland.  I think she said to drink it after the meal.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to soak my noodles in it.  Basically, I was kind of lost.  There was a choice of 3 sizes, small, regular and large.  I would probably get the regular if ordering no appetizers.  However, at $15.75 for a small and $18 for a regular, it's overpriced for what you get.  The girls in our party said the bathroom was pretty high tech.  I'd come back to see what the hype was about and I would try their early bird dinner special.  I wouldn't get the same dish I tried again.
Jorge O.}México, D.F., Mexico}117}182}220}-1}4}4/22/2014Updatedreview}Today I did the $17 lunch box which is a ton of good food. It seems you have to go early for that bc they only sell 25 every day. Unfortunately for vegetarians it comes with Salmon and can't be substituted -well I didn't really try, maybe it can be.Hot soba so good as always. Green salad, assorted veggies, chunk of (steamed I'm guessing) salmon, veg. tempura and rice cube. I took the later 2 items to-go bc/ I was too full.They also gave me a small dessert and green tea, very pleasing. The service is pretty good, especially earlier when it's less crowded. They yell something when you walk in and sometimes on the way out too.
Frank Y.}Edgewater, NJ}0}1}0}-1}2}4/19/2014}Poor experience due to hostess deception, came in and was told 2 minutes for two. After 10 minutes she came back and said 5 more minutes. After 5 minutes was prompted with "are all 5 ppl here?" She then apologized bc she was meaning another party. Clearly, she seemed flustered and all over the place. finally was seated after we were about to leave. The food is good, as i have been here prior. just very dissapointed this time. may not come back
Caroline P.}Manhattan, NY}135}32}32}-1}4}4/13/2014}No frills and great food. When you step in, the entire staff greets you in Japanese. Super simple aesthetic with a great atmosphere - my friend and I noted that the buzz of chatter was at the perfect level. Got the tuna steak don and clear soup. Clear soup sounds sort of boring but it was tasty, with a good amount of mushrooms and the right amount of tang. The tuna steak don was served on rice with mushrooms and a garlic sauce. It's the second time I've gotten it and I'll most probably get it a third time once I'm back here!
Kenneth P.}Denver, CO}327}174}50}-1}5}4/13/2014}Wow am I glad I found this place!I'm not usually a big fan of soba.  But maybe that's because soba is generally bought from distributors and sold in the restaurant.  This place has house-made soba!  And it definitely tasted like it.  The noodles were perfectly al dente.  You can tell the quality when you bite into it.I had the hot soba with some mushrooms and shrimp tempura.  I also had the salmon don and tuna steak don.  I'm ready to head back there next weekend, it was so good!Everything was all around delicious...I also tried the assortment of ice cream and green tea creme brulee.  The ice cream was:  black sesame, wasabi honey, green tea.  Word of advice, do not eat the ice cream then eat the creme brulee.  The flavor of the green tea creme brulee is very subtle and modest.  By eating sweet icecream beforehand, it'll destroy your palate for the creme brulee.
Jannifer H.}San Francisco, CA}352}183}778}-1}4}4/10/2014}Come here for your soba fix! Love how it comes with so many other tiny side dishes. (like mini chirashi) They make sure you dont leave feeling hungry. This place isnt super busy but it is somewhat of a smaller place. Prices are reasonable. Food is good and up to par, but I wouldn't say it's "OMG you must try!".
Donna S.}New York, NY}20}285}803}-1}4}4/8/2014}Came here for a friend's birthday and because I'm not a big soba fan, I ordered the Salmon and Ikura Chirashi which was fresh and amazing.We got there at 6p and were seated right away, but about half an hour later, the place was packed and people waiting out the door. So yea - go early!
Vivian W.}Brooklyn, NY}2}6}0}-1}5}4/6/2014}My new favorite place! Great food! Noodles are great here! I don't have anything bad to say about this place. I like their lunch sets and lunch box sets. And the seared tuna is really good too. You have to try it for yourself!
Ayako Y.}Maida Vale, London, United Kingdom}25}179}114}-1}3}4/5/2014}Loved this place - one of a few soba place outside of japan. It was very good in 2012... 2 years later, I visited... Soba still has good texture but the dipping sauce is slightly off and most importantly my cold soba is served too cold... There is an optimal temperature of cold soba just like white wine and just cold would not do. Also there are too many rude staffs - it us simply becoming too annoying.What a gem it was and so sorry to see this on a decline...  Still worth a visit for a plate of cold soba or bowl of warm soba... Or early bird special ( cannot remember when it ends but really good combo deal of soba, sushi, and tempura) before it completely crashes...
Allene T.}Manhattan, NY}2117}1285}2910}18}5}4/4/2014}LOVED this.It took about 30-40 minutes for us to get a table of 3 on a Saturday night around 7pm.I ordered a small portion of cold soba.  I actually suggest ordering the plainest soba and then adding side dishes... in some cases, it actually comes out cheaper!  I got the cold soba + nori and added a side of enoki mushroom and salmon roe.  I LOVE salmon roe and they sure give you a generous portion of it.  In addition, my friend and I shared a mini sized salmon sashimi + salmon roe over rice.  This was 9 pieces of salmon sashimi with roe. This was amazing, as usual.  If you couldn't tell, I'm a huge salmon-anything fan.Soba was cooked perfectly and the cold sauce complemented it well.  Overall the whole thing was quite high in sodium though, so I had to keep drinking a lot of water :(A small soba order and a half a mini "don" was a fulfilling and perfect-sized meal for me.Can't believe I waited this long to try it!
Karolina B.}Middle Village, NY}3}22}7}-1}2}4/2/2014}I am pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place when I went on Monday March 31st.:o( been in bed for two days now: o( Its such a shame because the food was good. Ohh well guess I learned my lesson: never get fish!!!P.S. I got the lunch special
Wesley H.}Brooklyn, NY}15}295}0}-1}3}3/17/2014}Decent Japanese place with wide choice of Japanese appetizers and sobas. There's all sorts of soba such as uni, tuna, etc. The tofu here is especially good.
Ju L.}Osaka, Japan}943}905}1235}18}4}3/16/2014}There is no most sought-after bowl at this mainstay of NY's Little Tokyo Street.The Yasai hot soba is a lovely mess of slivers of scallion, carrot, fresh shiitake, enoki, white beech mushrooms, and edamame - clean and delightful, though with a clear broth that's heavier on the soy than I would've liked. The Tanuki bowl (fish cake and tempura bits) is equally simple but satisfying. Their soba noodles are pale and tender, not 100% buckwheat (i.e. not gluten-free), but made in-house with buckwheat imported from Japan. My "noodles represent long life!" consciousness noticed they were shorter than expected, probably the same length as a pack of soba you'd get at the supermarket. Bowls are available with soba/udon, hot/cold, and in 3 sizes. An average $17 for any one involving meat is pricey, considering ramen at Ippudo (yelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-n…) at the peak of ramen madness still comes in below that. The $18 "early bird" dinner special (5:30pm to 7pm Mondays through Thursdays) is a good deal and includes an appetizer, tempura, noodles, and dessert.Soba-Ya, Cocoron (yelp.com/biz/cocoron-new…), and Soba-Koh (yelp.com/biz/sobakoh-new…) are the soba titans of NYC. This place isn't as cute as Cocoron, which is consciously quirky and warm in a very LES way. True to Soba-Ya's very unassuming name (trans. "We have soba, that's all you need to know"), it looks more like an average Japanese spot - spare in decor, with light wood colors. They opened in 1998, which is ages ago in restaurant terms. Remember that soba is an inherently humble food, not requiring much fanfare, and the fact that the floor is slightly worn and the furniture probably hasn't changed in years won't bother you.Service is standard, this spot is casual despite the temptation of reducing soba into some austere ritual, and you can get a reliably great bowl of carefully-made noodles and broth for not too long of a wait, even during peak times. No reservations!
Noa B.}Brooklyn, NY}156}138}62}-1}1}3/16/2014}I came here with my friend for dinner yesterday; she had sushi and I ten zaru soba. She got her stomach upset immediately and i, only picked a piece of her sushi, had hard time at home. if they had served any less than edible, it's not worthy coming for. period.
Love N.}Harlem, Manhattan, NY}0}12}2}-1}5}3/14/2014}Great food! My friend took me here once and I become a regular now. Every time I get fresh meals.  The brunch menu on weekend offers good value.
Natsumi C.}Los Angeles, CA}33}41}0}-1}3}3/12/2014}I thought this would be amazing but it was just ok for me. We got the curry soba (a little sour so taste weird), duck namban (duck was over done and hard but soup was good), and vegetarian soba.  The soba itself is not bad the wish the dipping sauces were better
Lily C.}JACKSON HTS, NY}79}53}102}-1}4}3/9/2014}loved their soba noodles.  Their lunch box set is a great value - so much food. even more in love with their desserts - green tea and black sesame ice cream - not too sweet, perfect.  the wasabi honey was not my favorite.  the mini don's are a great option if you want a taste.  i'm a fan.
D H.}Manhattan, NY}0}43}78}-1}5}3/9/2014}Authentic Japanese noodles at a reasonable price (for Manhattan). I've tried many of the soba and udon dishes and pretty much everything is great. The soba is especially tasty (obviously). It always has the exact right firmness and temperature, and it's clear that they pay attention to every detail.If you're an uni lover, I especially recommend the uni soba. Simply amazing. Lunch specials are also a great deal
Jason P.}Forest Hills, NY}538}1119}3574}18}4}3/7/2014}Doors open precisely at 5:30 PM, so if you plan on getting there early on a rainy or cold day, don't expect to be let in any earlier. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted in Japanese. Just to the right, is a chef freshly making the soba noodles. It almost reminded me of my experiences of Rakuichi in Niseko, Japan. The establishment is small, with a dozen tables and another several single person seats wrapping around a L-shaped bar near the back of the restaurant. If it's your first time eating soba, you can opt for hot or cold. I prefer the cold as you really get to enjoy the freshness, texture, and flavor of the noodles as opposed to one being soaked in the broth. Scallions and wasabi are served on the side. Zaru (200 grams for $12.25), is a perfect introduction to cold soba, which includes a bed of soba sitting on a zaru (sieve-like bamboo mat) garnished with nori seaweed, tsuyu which is a dipping sauce for the soba, and a side serving of wasabi and scallions. Many might suggest to put the wasabi and scallions in the tsuyu, but I like to mix the wasabi with the soba. I then take a small amount of the soba and dip in in the tsuyu. I slowly mix it in, then slurp it up with my chopsticks, making sure to breathe air in as I suck. I find sucking air with the soba adds another layer of aroma and flavor. I learned these two tips from the Rakuichi chef straight from my visit to Japan....Yum!! There is a dinner pre-fixe menu ($18) that lets you try a little of everything. The first part of the pre-fixe is the appetizer, which is an assortment of 4 tastings varying from Kimpira Gobo (pan sauteed mountain burdock), Kabocha ( cooked Japanese squash), marinated lotus root, and a green vegetable. Each excels in different Japanese flavors and textures that will surely excite the taste buds. Next is your choice of hot or cold soba/udon noodles. Served on the side is vegetable & shrimp tempura which consists of 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 brocolli floret, and 1 thin sliced sweet potato. The batter is very light, airy, fresh and far from greasy, exactly how tempura should be prepared. Included on the side are 2 pieces of cold Inari sushi, which is a pouch of fried tofu filled with sushi rice. The sweetness of the fried tofu helps to take the edge off things, which I found myself devouring. Lastly, top top things off is a scoop of vanilla ice cream with strawberry.Soba-ya definitely offers some pretty fresh and delicious soba. The authenticity, freshness, and flavors are all there to make for a very enjoyable experience. However, there just seemed to be something missing. It may be because I'm comparing it to my unforgettable experience at Rakuichi, which is the best soba I've ever had, but so far Soba-ya have come the closest. I definitely recommend checking out Soba-ya out.
K K.}Jersey City, NJ}2}16}0}-1}4}3/1/2014}Super authentic Japanese noodle restaurant in NYC!!Lunch special is my favorite. I usually order Salmon don with cold udon.This salmon don is soooo gd and my boyfriend got addicted lolAlso noodles r sooooo delicious. Everytime I go here, I feel like I'm in Japan...Service are great, They are super polite and professional Japanese ppl=)I heard Lucy lu is a big fan of this place. 1 thing I can't give them 1 more star is, They don't take reservation..So when i go there for dinner,I have to wait for 30-40mins...well there is a nice bar across the street so i usually kill my time over there.But I'm a fan=))
Jennifer C.}Flushing, NY}37}81}42}-1}4}3/1/2014}All in all it was a great place. My bf really loves their soba so I've been here a few times. However, the udon curry katsu noodles on their special menu was awful. I don't think it's a good idea to mix Japanese curry (gravy like consistency) with udon noodles and add chicken katsu. I felt like I was eating gravy noodles. I really liked everything else I've ordered here before, so 4 stars, but don't get that udon curry thing. They have really fresh tofu for appetizers, and the price isn't too bad. The soba noodles are the best, and I loved their tempura.
Shane M.}New York, NY}0}21}4}-1}1}3/1/2014}The hostess tells everyone 10-15 min without accessing the tables...as the line gets longer and longer still "10-15 minutes" after 25 min I just walked away.
Patricia C.}Manhattan, NY}113}214}995}18}5}2/25/2014}The uni soba here just can't be beat... :) Their soba noodles are also cooked extremely well, much better than the sobas I've had at soba totto, weirdly.But to be honest, everything is good here (I try some of the other dishes my friends order), I just can't resist that every time I come! The service is great, and food comes out very fast.Get here early as this place fills up really quickly!
Cecilia G.}New York, NY}39}72}103}-1}3}2/20/2014}It's fresh but the soba portion is not generous at all.  I ordered the winter season special - oysters with soba.  Their regular size soba with oysters was like half a serving of soba noodles.  Was still hungry and ordered smoked chicken skewers.  Ended up spending $33 + 6 (tip) = $40.  Not worth it.  The flavor and portions are not amazing enough to justify the price.
George L.}Bronx, NY}178}96}144}-1}3}2/18/2014}The wait and the price does not add up to the quality and taste that I had expected. I came to Soba-ya to obviously eat their soba and was I a tad disappointed with the outcome. I waited like a hour to get a seat which is not really a problem as this place is famous and there was a line so that is to be expected. However, after I was seated and had a taste of their infamous soba, it tasted rather bland even with their special sauce that they gave me. I felt like I was eating soba with soy sauce. I added chicken meat and mushrooms to my dish which cost like an extra $5 or so. They literally gave me 4 slices of thinly sliced mushrooms and 3 small cuts of chicken breast. I find that quite ridiculous for any means.However, I give them 3-stars because their ingredients were fresh, they put a lot of care into preparing the order, and I did get uni as well, which was definitely worth it considering how big those uni was. Besides the uni, everything else was not worth the price that average around $14 to $20+ for a Soba with added toppings on it. I love soba and I had better ones at other places, however, Soba-ya just does not match up to my expectations.
Darryll S.}Manhattan, NY}197}235}61}18}3}2/17/2014}I just dont get it.Yes everything is fresh, yes service was goodBut overall, food was just... blandI got the chirashi cold soba. All the little additions/pieces/morsels on the soba was cooked nicely. Lots of flavor lots of good textures. However when it came to the actual part, the soba with the soy based sauce.. it was just .. blandDont get my wrong, i enjoyed my perfectly chewy noodles (yes they really do have great texture) but on a whole i was a little disapointed.Maybe its just me not understanding soba and how its supposed to taste... or maybe its just the dish that I got which was supposed to taste bland...How unfortunate, I wanted to like it :(
Meghan A.}New York, NY}223}570}479}18}4}2/15/2014}There's a reason for the 30 minute wait at 2pm on a Saturday - Soba-ya is very very good. There is definitely quick turnover here, and a Japanese expat vibe. The table next to us was summoning the waiter (instead of the American waiting to be served), just like they do in Tokyo.I chose the unagi-don lunch special ($16), since I really love eel. I had no idea what I was getting into. The portion was huge! A full serving of unagi-don, hot soba, pickles, it was a full tray of deliciousness. My unagi was nice and buttery, and the soba was just like I had in Japan. The only sad part was that I could not take the soba home with me, as those fresh noodles do not last long.
Buckmiller F.}ASTORIA, NY}1}16}0}-1}3}2/10/2014}This place USED to be my very favorite. I went there at least once a week and spent good money while at it. However, one day the management changed. It must have been 5-6 years ago. Everything that was great got thrown out or changed. The Yokozuna Salad was the best salad ever, and then they stopped it during lunch, got rid of the other sizes and it doesn't taste as good anymore. The Soba and Udon are still good, but not as good as before. They got rid of the Kangen Sui water and now it is tap water. The saké choices are not as good anymore. The waitstaff is not near as polite and courteous as before and the hostesses are downright rude and incompetent. One girl wouldn't even respond or say "welcome" or even "hello" and then rudely passed us up. Another one forgot we were on the list and we had to wait while people behind us got seated. The management needs to learn how to run a restaurant, i.e. train the waitstaff and hostesses. Yes, training is always needed to have a decent restaurant. The dishes and drinks are overpriced.Okay, i said a lot of negative things, but this is still a decent place. Just don't go on a Friday or Saturday night when it takes 2 hours to get a seat.
Amy S.}Manhattan, NY}107}126}144}-1}4}2/10/2014}This place is solid. The food is on point and the decor is clean, simple, and adorable. I came here with a girlfriend and we had a great time. She was craving udon and I love all things Japanese, so that's how we wounded up here. I had the chicken curry soba - it was good, but I can't say I would order it again. With so many options on the menu, I definitely want to come back and try some of the other noodle and appetizer options. The service was also fantastic, I love it when they are attentive but not disruptive. I'd like to take the bf back to try their early dinner specials.
Josh A.}Littleton, CO}2}90}0}-1}5}2/9/2014}I've only had the cold zaru soba and tempura, but they are so good that I went there three times in the one week I was in New York. Will definitely make the trip back for this gem.
Brooks J.}New York, NY}36}13}1}-1}5}2/9/2014}Soba beer! Get the lunch box set
Henry L.}San Mateo, CA}2368}836}3037}18}4}2/5/2014}Before coming to this place, I've only ever eaten soba served cold. In my mind, soba is supposed to be cold, and ramen is supposed to be warm.That is, until I went to soba-yaThe duck soba served in warm soup is unlike anything I've ever eaten! The oil from the duck slices mixes very well with the clear and yet deeply flavorful soup base, while the soba, unlike ramen, does not absorb the soup, and so provides an interesting contrast to the taste of the duck.The atmosphere is pretty nice as well, with the theme very much feeling like a actual Japanese room. It's slightly more expensive than other noodle shops in the area, but not by much. There is usually a wait line outside too, but not too long.One of the few place I go back to again and again and again.
Michael L.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}98}1}-1}3}1/30/2014Updatedreview}This place used to be fantastic not too long ago.  What happened!  New chef? New rude bus boys?  I wont be coming back any time soon.
Jonathan C.}New York, NY}183}123}7}-1}4}1/30/2014}Preface: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value). Less meat, no more 2 Chipotle burrito eating.Came in for lunch here and a few times before for dinner. The soba noodles are good. They don't quite have that perfect al dente chewiness level that Cocoron achieves, but everything is very good - the broth is tasty enough, but not overpowering, and the noodles are good but not perfect.The lunch box set, at $17, is a great value. You get a lot of food and you'll be stuffed by the time you leave. It comes with yam, lotus root, a mini block of rice with salmon roe on top, a cooked fish, a small garden salad, and then warm soba noodles with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and a vegetable tempura. You can choose warm or cold and soba or udon noodles. They only have 25 lunch box sets daily, so coming in at 12:30pm, I thought I would be cutting it close - but it looked like they still had 20 by the time I came, and by the time I left around 1:20pm, they still had 18 left. The menu is pretty extensive, so it makes sense that not everyone was ordering the lunch box set.Honestly, the set in addition to the soba was OK - that portion of the meal is average tasting - but the soba noodles make up for it. Next time I come, unless I'm really hungry, I'll probably choose something else besides the lunch box set - I'll probably try one of their other lunch specials with sashimi. The Japanese dessert pudding, on the other hand, was awesome. I really enjoyed it - it was small, it wasn't too sweet, it was the perfect dessert to such a filling meal.All in all, I'll come back. It's definitely worth coming here, only because their soba noodles are on point. And the dessert pudding was great. The other stuff is alright.
y y.}Manhattan, NY}0}87}0}-1}4}1/28/2014}I like this place. The food is great. It got a bit too busy ever since they got on the Michelin's Bib Gourmand list and the wait could be long, however since Honmura-an (used to be the best soba restaurant in town) is closed, you will have no choice but go to Sobaya if you like to have decent soba in nyc. What's sad was when I went there recently, I checked my coat but when I leave, I realized actually my coat was HUNG FROM A HOOK ON THE WALL! And it was my $5,000 coat with silk lining! When I complained, the hostess said "we don't have a hanger", I told them to THEN GET SOME RIGHT NOW. They are too used to village crowd dressed in H&M? I find it quite rude.. but food is good so I have no choice but go back to this one.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}4}1/27/2014Updatedreview}I had a good time and lunch today. I opted Soba noodle soup and Ebi tempura as a set from the lunch menu. It was a happily-filling lunch. The memorable dish was soba noodle soup, the broth... Least favorite was the tempura, light but soggy. The ending gesture, a small dessert, was nice.The corner counter was a comfortable spot to sit in the restaurant if you are alone. It has more room. My server, Julie, was efficiently polite. Although it was busy, we chatted and shared our New York stories. I am coming back for lunch soon.
Nick T.}New York, NY}69}100}257}-1}4}1/26/2014}I love coming here before 7pm for their dinner special, its definitely worthwhile to make the arduous journey here from work and making it here before 7pm. For 18 dollars you get a salad, assorted appetizers, tempura soba, tofu sushi and dessert too! This is definitely a steal being that you'd be paying double that if you ordered everything a la carte. Needless to say, I always add the salmon sashimi as an appetizer every single time I come here and without a doubt is definitely one of the freshest salmon I've had in the city. Whilst the appetizers were definitely an interesting assortments of flavor and the tempura soba was definitely the best part of the meal, a clean clear broth with amazing noodles. The desert was a vanilla ice cream with some sort of berry, I believe either strawberry or raspberry. Overall the entire meal is definitely a wonderful dinner, I'd definitely advise getting there before 7 to take advantage of this special and the wait to eat. The total for 2 people with tip came out to 45 dollars with the dinner special.
Mick L.}Alpine, NJ}3027}455}3288}-1}5}1/24/2014}Soba-ya was recommended to me by a trusted sushi chef who owned a restaurant in lower Manhattan. Remembering this, I sought out this authentic Japanese eatery for a refreshing plate of hand made soba noodles and was I ever happy. Excellent service with a great feel in this intimate space and most importantly hand made soba, I was ready to eat. Can't get enough of the traditional noodle of Tokyo so I always have imported dried soba and soba tsuyu in my pantry (along with a few zarus). It has been my experience that in order to best experience the fine flavor and texture of hand-made soba noodles you must eat them cold, since letting them soak in a soup alters their consistency and the buckwheat flavor leaches out to the hot broth. The eating of fresh vegan friendly and thiamine-rich buckwheat soba for me is a simple affair so my mind is already made up before entering, I'm going with the zaru soba. This dish is served chilled on a bamboo mat placed over a tray (called a zaru) and accompanied by a dipping sauce known as soba tsuyu (can be altered to vegan or skipped) in a small bowl on the side. Just had the soba, but the menu is well thought out for those thinking outside the zaru. My soba was absolutely perfect, made from 100% buckwheat imported from Japan, its around $11 for the large and a most satisfying meal!Went with the namesake and was thrilled!BSE22
Peter K.}Manhattan, NY}432}602}58}18}4}1/22/2014}Came here for lunch. Tried their set menu deal where you get a bowl of soba with a bowl of donburi for something like $12-15. The amount of food you get here is fairly generous.The decor is minimalistic with clean woodcut furniture easily found in so many Japanese establishments. Space was slightly cramped but not uncomfortably so.The service was not bad. Could have been a little more expedient, but nothing worthy of a real complaint.As I mentioned before, the portions are quite large here, which would usually indicate a trade off in quality. However, the quality of the food here, as in so many Japanese restaurants, is uncompromising. The katsu in the katsu don was crunchy and flavorful. The noodles in the soba were perfectly cooked just a little past al dente. The broth was so good that I drank the entire bowl. Sodium levels be damned.All in all, this has to be my favorite soba spot in NYC, even better than, dare I say, cocoron.
Kristina L.}New York, NY}984}500}1179}18}3}1/18/2014}Dine out for Japan Restuarant week! Eat for a good cause, japan tsunami relief!Setting: Prepare for a little wait. 30-40 min.Service: a little slowKamo Nanban: duck and Tokyo negi (green onions)This is one of my favorite dishes here. I haven't had duck like this before, but they slice it into small thin pieces. Chirashi: baby sardine tempura, Japanese omelette, shiitake mushrooms, fried bean curd, fish cakeBe prepared.. the ingredients in this dish are all sweet. What s nice is that the broth is not salty. Overall: I think it was ok, not the best soba but a nice cute place for a date.
Olivia S.}New York, NY}629}577}956}18}5}1/9/2014}I honestly didn't think I'd be in awe after having a bowl of soba at this restaurant. But I was amazed at how delicious a bowl of warm noodles could melt me.My friend & I ordered the tuna tartare to share. In all seriousness, I didn't expect much of it... I mean, come on, tuna tartare with a mountain of yams and avocado? What's so impressive? But wow, Soba-ya, you have impressed me. The textures played well with each element being cut into fine small pieces. Every bite provided a crunchy fresh taste of yams with creamy avocado and refreshing tuna tartare with a pinch of saltiness of shredded seaweed topping.For my main, I had ordered a small Yasai soba. The soba noodles was so soft and thin that I could've slurped it down quickly without a problem. But I wanted to enjoy this bowl of noodles knowing that it was an extremely cold night. I was delighted to see my bowl filled with edamame peas, thinly shredded carrots, scallion, shallots & a medley of mushrooms. The broth was set to just the right temperature - making my bowl of soba perfect with each slurp! Each spoonful I took in was warm & fulfilling with a slight kick in spice at the end. Deliciously satisfying. Oh yeahhh!For the finale, we got the green tea brulee. A tad more on the expensive side for a small cup of dessert but SO worth it. The green tea brulee was creamy & light (yes, LIGHT - not heavy!) topped with a glazed covering of burnt sugar. The lower half of the green tea brulee had more of a pudding consistency and the top half was more of an extremely moist cake. I was surprised at how light this dessert was & it was the perfect ending.Typical Japanese joint - don't expect anything fancy. But great for a quick grub & drink. Delish. Make my tummay melt!
Erika P.}Union Square, Manhattan, NY}2}10}35}-1}2}1/7/2014}Came here for lunch and was seated by the bar by a very curt waitress. There was a good selection of interesting toppings but the soba was too salty and they overcooked my friend's bowl that came with the lunch set.
Monte H.}Manhattan, NY}363}318}175}18}4}1/5/2014}Soba is ingenious for being appropriate in both hot and cold weather.  Not many other noodles can proclaim this. Pho is just awful in the hot humid weather, but cold soba is great. And whereas bun thit nuong is awesome in the summer, in the wintertime you just want something brothy like..hot soba. Congratulations soba, you have conquered mother nature's fickle effects on our stomach. Oh, and this place makes great soba, so I do must recommend it. Everything in general is delicious, including the raw fish and complimentary dessert that comes in the fantastic lunch deal. Slurp to your heart's content. Slurp to your neighbor's discontent. Just slurp.
T Z.}New York, NY}39}78}1}-1}4}1/5/2014}It really depends on your taste... and the dish selection. I love this place but to be honest some soba are just not good at all while the others are amazing... so it really depends on what your taste is and whether that fits with the dish you ordered... the desert menu is a must try... the green tea ice cream is unreal
B. T.}San Francisco, CA}0}50}0}-1}4}1/4/2014}It was a dark and post-stormy night and my intestinal tract was recovering from hyper-spicey curry so what seemed ideal was warm Japanese noodles.As is my habit, I got there at the 5:30 opening so getting in was no problem/no wait.  I ordered soba topped with a tempura trio of shrimp, a chili and some kind of leaf, and also some oshinko (Japanese pickled veggies) on the side.  The oshinko was mild but good.  The tempura pretty standard.  The soba itself was nice but I can't say it was in any way special.It was the broth in which the soba were served that requires comment.  It tasted beefy.  Beefier than beef, actually.  So beefy it almost tasted artificially beefy.  That's not necessarily bad--I quite liked it and drained the bowl.  But some people might find it too intense (and, yes, kind of salty).  I just wonder what accounted for that flavor intensity 'cause I don't want it to be just a double dose of commercial stock.
Misha T.}Honolulu, HI}617}3819}97}18}4}1/3/2014}Got the chirashi soba which was sort of the grab of a number of their different soba soup toppings. There was a fine japanese omelet (which i don't normally like), some tasty greens, bits of fish cake, and the best which was some tempura'd greens that really were perfect in the soup. Just the right mix of tasting rich, soggy and crispy. The soba itself tasted of higher quality than the usual stuff you get but alas the dashi was too salty. Kinda induced too much thirst to be honest.
Hyuk L.}San Francisco, CA}20}36}53}-1}2}1/2/2014}Cold ass f**ck today in NYC. Haven't been out here in over three years. Ippudo had an hour and half wait. Was not waiting that long for no damn noodles. Walked by this place and saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try. I got the soba with wild plants. Soba was over cooked and broth was really slacking. Not worth $16.50 First meal in NYC was major bust.
Asuka N.}New York, NY}345}1459}0}18}4}12/30/2013}I haven't been to a lot of Japanese noodle shops outside of those that serve ramen, so it was nice to stop by Soba-ya and enjoy a lunch that focused more on the other noodle offerings the cuisine has to offer. Even though we got there shortly after it opened on the weekend, it was nearly full by the time we got seated. There's a reasonable amount of seating, but it is cozy and can fill up on a cold winter day quite quickly. Service is pretty standard, although they do a good job of keeping your water glass filled.As for the food - my fiancee wasn't as big a fan, but I think there's a heck of a lot of variety when it comes to picking out your broth choices, the additional toppings, as well as the noodles themselves (most of the dishes can be served with either soba or udon). I went with curry broth, which is a bit heavier than what I feel would be standard, but it wasn't as heavy as what you'd find over rice, and it worked well with the buckwheat noodles in providing a warm dish (adding some scallions on the side to up the heat a little didn't hurt, either). My fiancee had a version with duck; while the meat was pretty standard, the broth definitely was infused with the rich flavors of the meat. We also got a couple pieces of inari - pretty standard; if anything, you can tell that they're not really using rice that you usually find at a sushi place - it was standard-use rice.In all, a nice little noodle shop among the many Japanese restaurants in this part of East Village. I'd stop by again to try one of their many different dishes out.
Kris S.}Babson Park, MA}11}18}3}-1}4}12/27/2013}Mushroom tempura special, and their sobas are one of the weirdest (in a good way) and nicest things to eat in j-village. Nice restaurant!
Lavi W.}Plainsboro Township, NJ}37}193}6}-1}4}12/26/2013}This small place looks pretty authentic-- like the ones in the Japanese tv shows that I watch! We waited for around 20 min for a table at lunch time. I ordered mini lunch set with a small bowl of hot soba and a bowl of chicken and egg don. Soba was very flavorful. I forgot to stir the don at first, so the egg white was kinda liquidy after I finished soba because the temperature was not high enough. Hopefully I didn't feed myself live Salmonella lol. Even the small dish- yam, pumpkin and lotus, that came with the lunch set was very tasty. I especially enjoyed the sugared yam. The overall eating experience there was very enjoyable!
Johnny W.}San Francisco, CA}1099}1150}250}18}2}12/22/2013}Having had amazing soba in Southern California, and finding that option a bit lacking in the Bay Area, I was pretty pumped to find out about Soba-ya, coming with some friends and ordering the:- Kamo Seiro - To be fair, this style of dipping cold soba into a hot broth (similar to tsukemen), has historically not been a style I'm too fond of. That said, my main issue here was that I found the flavor of the broth itself a little unpleasant, though I can't pinpoint why exactly. The soba noodles themselves were made rather well though. - Oyakodon - This is one of those dishes that's hard to mess up, and they certainly did not. While not as good as some other places I've had it at, theirs was still enjoyable.Now, unfortunately, given that this is a soba place, and I found the soba I tried rather lackluster, I can't see myself coming back, unless it's to give their actual hot sobas a try. But, the service I received the night of was a bit strange as well, almost as if they weren't sure how to handle a customer that was in a wheelchair, fumbling around with our seating arrangements, and dragging out our wait.***Accessibility Info***Venue - A cramped venue with tight table arrangements, there are precious few viable accessible seating options in the restaurant. If you're okay transferring to a chair or booth, these options increase dramatically.Bathroom - Didn't check them out, but I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't accessible.
Max C.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}21}25}79}-1}1}12/19/2013}I was looking forward to eating here but I was very disappointed. The broth was too salty here and I was mad thirsty after my meal. I don't think the soba was worth the price.
Helen V.}Brooklyn, NY}190}209}11}-1}3}12/15/2013}Was really looking forward to trying this place since it's been so cold out but I was pretty disappointed. First off, I had a tough time deciding what to order because all the toppings were...interesting. I ended up asking the server for the most popular dish and he recommended the Tempura Soba. Authentic or not, the soup base was too salty. I am still thirsty just thinking about how much sodium I consumed during this meal. The dish came with three pieces of shrimp tempura which I thought was pretty generous but not worth the $15 price tag. Doubt I'll be back.
Ellen H.}Manhattan, NY}33}46}6}-1}3}12/9/2013}Okay my biggest problem with this place is that they don't offer sauce for the tempura if you order it with soba or udon. I think that's just simply unacceptable for a place that calls itself "authentic." I asked the waitress about it and she was just like yeah just dip it in your soba sauce! Soba sauce and tempura sauce are TOTALLY different things!!!Apart from this minor kinda MAJOR detail the food is good, a little overpriced I would say, considering that you could walk two blocks and get 10$ set with udon and rice or st-marks....
Yunong Z.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}1}9}5}-1}3}12/7/2013}They have really weird toppings for the soba. I thought I wanna try something new but urgh - weird. Maybe the traditional zaru soba is good. maybe.
Mochi N.}Oakland, CA}6}138}5}-1}5}12/2/2013}LOVE it! This place is totally authentic. The soba broth is extremely subtle and not overwhelming. Their specials for the night included: Oyster soba (my choice), Matsutake soba (my friend got the last one for the night), and Sansai soba (next time, Sobaya, next time....) Another friend ate their Nabeyaki Udon, which was filled with tempura, enoki, and bunch of other things. Yum!The soba come in two different sizes: regular and large. The regular is plenty big enough, I thought. They come out with sliced scallions and do not have much else, so you might want to add some extras on top. The wait really wasn't bad by NY standards, and the hostess was nice enough to call us when we went across to Decibel to get a sake while we waited.
Jacqueline T.}Pasadena, CA}744}133}162}-1}3}11/26/2013}I know, I know. I'm a heretic. Despite this place been Michelin recommended, it's listed as "Bib Groumand" (whatever that means), I didn't particulary like it. My friends and I got here around 8PM and we still had to wait 30 minutes. The hostess was completely lost, and I do mean COMPLETELY. She skipped tables and totally forgot about me despite calling my name 5 minutes prior. I mean, is my face that forgettable? After being seated, I ordered the small duck udon, as everyone had raved about on Yelp. I wasn't too particularly hungry, but when the udon came out, it was indeed quite small. I thought that the soup was bland, the duck slices minimal, and the udon average. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought I overpaid for, basically, carbs. I guess this is very traditional Japanese style udon. If you like minimalist Japanese udon, then this is the place for you. But for me, I wouldn't come here again.
S H.}Augusta, GA}0}6}1}-1}4}11/23/2013}Good authentic soba. Dashi is little salty but good soba. Little cramped and rushed. But overall good!
Calvin S.}Winnipeg, Canada}74}1091}1251}18}4}11/18/2013}I came here by pure accident, randomly walking in after having a snack across the street at Otafuku. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I'm certainly glad I came here for what would be lunch.Since we weren't too hungry, my family shared two bowls: Kamo Nanban Udon and Yasai Soba. Both were very delicious, and both the soba and udon were very fresh and filling. The broth was a little on the salty side, but not totally unbearable. I will however take away a star for that.Service was fast and efficient, and relatively attentive, though we did have to wait a bit before we managed to get the bill.The food adventure in NYC continues. One thing I love about big cities is that the adventure never ends.
zmoney t.}Manhattan, NY}175}72}0}-1}2}11/15/2013}Tempura was very oily, to the point where my stomach felt gross after a few bites.  This is probably because the kitchen is in a hurry to fry the food, and the oil wasn't hot enough.  Go a few blocks down the street to Soba Ko instead.
Xanthe N.}New York, NY}0}5}5}-1}1}11/12/2013}I went there a lot of time! There were very good! Good service, good soba.......But I went there tonight I'm very disappointed with the service and the food! When I entered the restaurant and sat down for 10mins, no one gave me a cup of tea or water! So, I asked them, and they said ok. ...that's it. ,.When I ready for order, I had to wait about 5mins.@@! Ok! I waited. ...I wented there for the kake sobs all the time! !!This time I'm so disappointed!!!the soup were very SALTY!!!! I told them and they said to the chief.  And they said they try it before when they cook the soba! !and the service not like before! !and the food too! !!I will not go there again! !!Very Disappointed! !!
Danielle C.}Jersey City, NJ}103}189}14}-1}4}11/11/2013}grateful for another kid friendly find in the city.... and it's yummy authentic japanese food!  The noodles are freshly made and delicious.  Our table got a combination of both soba and udon and everyone was pleased.  Crowded, but we didn't wait long. (arrived at 3pm on saturday)It's loud for kid noises and casual enough for kid messes (we did leave a nice tip, though b/c of our little ones' mess).FYI  the high chairs they use are the kind that attach to the table top.  It was our first time using one like that.  We liked it, as it really buckled our son close to the table and made it easier for him to eat his food and engage with the table.
Allison Y.}San Francisco, CA}744}384}2}-1}3}11/10/2013}i'm torn about this place. i was in a soupy mood so i ordered the hot soba with duck. it came in a broth that was waaay too salty to the point of undrinkable. however, my friend ordered the yamakake, which was the cold soba with tuna and mountain yam, and it was absolutely amazing. the dipping sauce was delicious and strong and flavorful but not too salty or overwhelming by any means. and they gave us hot water to pour over her dish so she could drink the dipping sauce as a soup. so basically i could've ordered that too!! ugh lol. we also split a salmon/ikura don and the fish and ikura sat over a bed of regular rice (not sushi rice) which was disappointing. the fish quality was above average but not amazing. i love that they have different sizes for all the soba at fair price points. if i come back, i will DEFINITELY get the cold soba
Carrianne C.}Boston, MA}112}417}79}18}4}11/7/2013}It was really chilly today so my friend and I had a hankering for something warm to fill us up. We both ordered the hot Kamo Seiro (duck and green onion) noodles. I had soba, and she had the udon. I personally LOVED the soba noodles in it, but my friend said she enjoyed the udon style as well. The broth was really good, and very rich from the duck. We weren't looking to have a huge meal so we both got the smaller portion of noodles and the portions actually ended up being really filling. They also have a great early bird special where you can get this prix fixe dinner with apps, noodles, and dessert, but it ends at 7pm. The service was good and the place was pretty packed as we were leaving. I want to come back and try some of the cold noodles at some point too.
Mika S.}San Francisco, CA}22}93}3}-1}2}11/5/2013}It's kind of a long story how we came to find this place. But basically it was recommended to us as the best sushi in NYC.And then we sat down...And realized they don't even sell sushi.Okay ya sure they have sashimi right? So that's what I ended up ordering. And since they have "the best sushi" in the city I decided to get salmon belly, even though it was more expensive and I've never ordered it before. And I got age dashi tofu.The salmon was not raw. Like, not at all. It was like a few pieces of salmon, on a plate,  NOT RAW. I felt like I had just ordered a few slivers of fish, cooked, on a plate, for $12.The age dashi tofu was pretty good, though.My sister got the special which was really expensive ($18) for just udon with chicken in curry sauce. She ended up picking out every piece of chicken because it was gross and chewy. I'm a vegetarian and all I had to do was look at it and see exactly what she was talking about. Those fatty meat pieces are what made me go veggie. So she ate her meal, but basically paid $18 for udon in curry sauce.My other friend ordered udon, and instead they gave him soba. He had to tell them a couple times that he definitely DID order udon, not soba, but they did come out with his correct dish really quickly.Basically, I would not go here again. When I order expensive sashimi, I want it to be raw. I paid $31 for 3 pieces of tofu, a few pieces of cooked salmon, and one beer. How is that okay? My sister paid the same amount for udon and beer.I think next time I'll do my own research on the best sushi in NYC.
Michael M.}New York, NY}276}107}0}-1}3}11/4/2013}The ambiance is really nice and has an authentic feel. Service is good. Our server was fast and knowledgeable. Definitely overpriced for what it is. I don't mind paying a premium for quality food if it is good AND filling. When we left we were definitely still very hungry. So we went across the street and got octopus balls. SO good.
Lesley C.}New York, NY}186}30}13}-1}4}11/3/2013}I'm all about the Kamo Seiro (cold noodles, duck slices and tokyo negi in a hot dipping sauce). When you finish your noodles they provide you with hot water so you can drink the dipping sauce like a soup.I'm also a huge fan of the (complimentary) matcha green tea, and the fact that they make the soba right in plain view (though it's a little weird that they keep them behind a glass like a zoo exhibition - I guess it's more sanitary?).Just be careful about the wait time for a table - it gets super packed for dinner, so go early or late.
Kristofer E.}Menlo Park, CA}113}205}379}18}4}11/1/2013}The soba here is really good. The duck soba hot is probably the best bet. Some of the sashimi apps are very good as well especially the raw shrimp when they have it.Dinner:  -Hot soba (duck, mushroom/veg)  -Cold soba (tempura)
Daniel L.}New York, NY}407}223}72}-1}4}10/25/2013}Solid 4 stars. I got the DUCK SOBA broth was delish, the duck itself was meh. BUT if you want to get something that's really surprisingly amazing, treat yourself to the Tuna donburi with avocado and cilantro. Wow. I had that as an appetizer, and so should you (if you come here on a cold day). Their sobas are certainly worth it!
Ulla L.}New York, NY}28}63}0}-1}1}10/22/2013}Did I visit the wrong place?! b/c these are my impressions: Not authentic.Duck noodles - the broth was good, but the duck was pretty inedible.Friend got the special and it definitely reeked of Americanized (not in a good way) Japanese food you find in suburban malls - think Chicken Teriyaki bull shit. Her dessert was vanilla ice cream with strawberries drenched in syrup... seriously?Sorry, but this place is super disappointing. I would rather make a trip to Cocoran in the LES.
L C.}Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY}0}13}0}-1}2}10/17/2013}If you want real japanese food prepared and served by real japanese people go next door to Robataya. At sobaya food was on par with the chain East. Yeah, pretty subpar. Worse, servers are chinese and mexicans. Maybe there was one japanese guy behind the bar and one other server. My server she was clueless and seemed like deer in headlights ever time we asked her something- annoying. It just looks japanese on the outside but messed up on the inside. I give 2 stars for the soba noodle alone and not even the broth.
Elaine K.}New York, NY}2}17}88}-1}5}10/13/2013}$17 bento box lunch included hot soba in broth, shrimp and okra tempura, grilled salmon, rice square topped with salmon roe, veggies, and dessert. A steal but they only serve 25 a day. Get there early!
Jennifer M.}Duluth, GA}53}228}50}-1}4}10/2/2013}I inhaled my food as soon as it came out. I ordered the Tororo, which was a simple hot soba dish with great mountain yam and nori seaweed. The soup was perfectly seasoned and tasted great. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the toppings added a nice flavor without overpowering the rest of the dish. I've got to say that their soba is really good. The regular size is the perfect amount to keep you feeling satisfied, but not full.Their tempura on the other hand is whatever. It is so overpriced and they deep fry the most random vegetables (at least in my opinion).
Jess W.}Manhattan, NY}222}319}274}18}2}9/30/2013}I usually love soba-ya and am hoping this just chalked up to a bad night. I ordered a regular sized curry seiro udon. While the bowl was huge, and I'm sure the noodles were measured out - I'm upset that it only came with 4 bite size pieces of chicken. For a price of $16, I expected more.
Irene P.}Manhattan, NY}94}103}16}-1}1}9/24/2013}Hmm, not impressed. Read all the rave reviews and went, hoping to break my Cocoron addiction. Venue was a little steamy/smelly, but chalked that up to the awesome food it was purported to have. Ordered the Tem Zaru with sesame sauce ($1) on the side, and boyfriend got the Curry Seiro (I think). Aiya. Boyfriend got a whole TON of noodles and only a tiny bowl of dip. I got overfried tempura, to the point where I couldn't taste the shiso leaf at all, and the shrimp definitely looked frozen/thawed. Both our noodles were limp and sticky, like they were overcooked and old. Whatever the case, they certainly didn't taste homemade. Let's talk the sesame sauce. It was excessively salty and looked and tasted artificial. I asked for daikon ($1), dumped the whole thing in. The sauce was still too salty. Helpless, I asked for a second helping of daikon. Still didn't cover that plastic-y (best way I can think of to describe the texture and flavor of the sauce) and overseasoned taste. Made do. At bill-paying time, noticing we were about to write in the tip, the server kindly reminded us that he very generously didn't charge us for the second order of on-the-side daikon.Maybe we went on a bad day?
Salvatore F.}Manhattan, NY}27}12}9}-1}4}9/21/2013}Please do yourself a favor and ignore most of the noodle/yakitori places on St. Marks and come on up a block to Soba-ya instead.  Far better quality for only a little extra money. Their Kamo Seiro soba noodle is great (and get it with shitake mushroom!).  The duck well prepared and not too fatty, the soba noodles definitely live up to the hype.  The ambiance is nice too; the interior designers definitively have an eye for detail and made a restaurant that looks as good as it tastes.  I was not disappointed at all.  Best part is you can get takoyaki afterwards across the street too!  This place passes the test - legit Japanese and tasty too!P.S.  Their eel is also incredible!
Chrissy C.}CANAL STREET, NY}52}313}14}-1}4}9/21/2013}had the nabeyaki udon and a bowl of tuna with avocado and cilantro.  both were amazingggg.    that cilantro just brought a standard favorite to a whole new level.  love!  fyi, the nabeyaki udon is quite large.  i had to have my bf help me finish.  you get to watch them make the soba noodles in his little glass corner.  a little entertainment as you wait for your bowl of noodles.  i get easily amused by little things like that hehhe.  they have a great early bird special.  18$ for an entire set.  you can check out their website menu if you wanna know what it is beforehand.  i think this place is best for 2-4 person seating.  anything larger you may be in for a bit of a wait.
Kimberly J.}Chantilly, VA}836}1718}23934}18}4}9/16/2013}Freshly made Soba!Upon entering, you can see your noodles being made. What a treat. We took a seat at the bar, our server was very friendly and attentive. Employees here are sweet. Love that the restroom is so clean and they were burning incense inside. At the beginning of your meal, a hot towel is provided. That was a wonderful way to freshen up. I appreciate that our water and tea cups were always full. They serve excellent matcha green tea and it's complimentary. Presentation of dishes are beautiful. The Soy Cured Tuna and Salmon Sashimi were really fresh, cool, and smooth. Simply melts in your mouth. The Cold Soba was lovely. Nice chew and fresh. The dipping sauce it comes with was a bit too salty for us. Towards the end of our meal, we were given a pot of hot water. We were told to pour it into our dipping sauce and drink the mixture as soup. We had a delicious meal here. Everything was light and flavorful. Quality ingredients used. Their lunch boxes are great. The restaurant gets filled up quick for lunch during weekends. Come early.
Catherine T.}Manhattan, NY}12}208}182}-1}3}9/15/2013}I came here with a friend. On a Saturday night at 9pm in the middle of summer with no reservation, the wait was less than an hour. We were chatting so I wasn't really paying attention to the time and there were few people ahead of us anyway. It's longer than I would typically wait but we didn't really feel like wandering around to find another place. Things seemed to move quickly enough given the circumstances. I ordered the soba with duck and scallions and I think she ordered the tuna. I hate the way the duck was cooked. I don't eat a lot of Japanese food (aside from sushi) so I was missing my juicy, flavorful Chinese-style duck. The duck was very well done. It was rather tough and chewy. The duck was sliced thin, almost like how I'd slice beef, and very fatty. The noodles were OK. I wasn't aware that soba noodles are made with buckwheat at the time so I was surprised at how rough they were. But the thing that really ruined the soup for me was how salty the broth was. It was impossible to ignore how salty it was. If it had been better I might have had a different opinion but to me it was overpriced given the fact that Chinatown is so close and there are much better options for noodle soup with duck.We went back and forth debating the matter but eventually we decided to order dessert. I chose the green tea brulee and I am so happy I did because it redeemed the meal. There wasn't a real intense green tea flavor but for my taste, there was enough. The sugar on top was perfect. The texture of the creme brulee was very creamy. It was almost more like a pudding but whatever it was, it was delicious.Service was very friendly. The hostess was lovely about getting us seated as quickly as possible and the waitstaff came back to refill our water glasses and check in with us a few times. My recommendation would be to just come by and get the green tea brulee. You're an adult. You make your own decisions. ;)
dodonna j.}Los Angeles, CA}135}42}501}-1}5}9/15/2013}I absolutely loved the soba. It's not any other soba I have ever ordered at other restaurants. This was authentic! the texture was chewier and the noodles were a bit thinner the color was also different. I got the most traditional one which was quite plain with the dipping sauce on the side. I added three toppings nori, tempura crust and a half boiled egg. Served cold, a side of tempura which was also good, not over battered with flour. Salmon sashimi was fresh, and agedashi tofu was also not bad. Too bad I don't live in NYC or else I would probably go there once a week ;)I'm giving it a five star not because its the best thing in the world. I'm giving it a five star for what it is.making normal food taste better than it is.
Steve B.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}126}618}53}-1}4}9/14/2013}Awesome Soba and Udon soup, feels very traditional and classic - come here for the real stuff.I've been here twice with my GF and have been happy each time - for me, it's always hot Udon soup, duck meat, eggs, all sorts of yummy goodness.  The large bowl is enough for me, very filling.  Great ingredients, all around a tasty meal.She's gotten different things, often cold soba noodles as it was summer.  Most of the time she's been very happy too, but once she got the Yamakake - it was a nasty slimy pile of yams.  Skip it, get almost anything else here.As the weather eventually gets cold, I'll be here and get some good udon noodles again - if you love good Japanese food, you'll be happy here too.
Jenny H.}San Francisco, CA}352}456}642}-1}5}9/13/2013}No Frills. Just Comforting.I have a particularly strong affinity for soba compared to anything else on a japanese restaurant menu. It's a beautifully simplistic dish. Noodles + dipping sauce. You waste nothing-- the water used to boil the noodles get served back into the remaining sauce and you have a nice hot broth to end the meal. Zen.At Soba-ya, it just can't get any better than walking in and seeing a guy stringing out some noodles from scratch. I was in soba heaven. 100g, 150g, 200g. Lots of "toppings" to choose from!  Got mine with mushroom, radish, and seaweed. In retrospect, less is better and I should've ordered the mori/zaru/tenzaru. Respect the noodle. One of the pleasures of soba is the pick-up and dip ritual but when you've got the extra stuff, you have to pour the sauce into the bowl. Regardless, it was FANTASTIC. We ended the meal with a light, soy milk pudding. Had a lovely late lunch and hope to come back on my next visit!
Jessica V.}Brooklyn, NY}8}83}1}-1}5}9/5/2013}Great atmosphereExtensive Menu of really interesting uncommon itemsPleasant, albeit a tad brusque, staffI came here with a few friends and I had the quite painful situation of having to find a super low calorie meal. (I hate being that person.) BUT, there were a number of great options. The Clear Fish Broth is so simple, be incredible delicious. Light and flavorful, but not overly salty like some miso.I had a steamed arugula and shiso leaf special that was exquisite. Again, quite light, but flavorful. Along with that came broccoli rabe (called something not like broccoli rabe at all), and it was simple and delicious. My friends tucked in to some noodles and they all looked great. I will definitely be heading back.
Jane H.}Saratoga, CA}16}35}3}-1}4}9/3/2013}Come and enjoy their autumn specialties! I just had their oyster soba! Super delicious!!
ana-marie c.}New York, NY}102}16}0}-1}5}9/1/2013}Went for late dinner on Saturday night, around 9pm? Was quickly ushered to a cozy little booth and served hot towels...I love those things! Ordered the chicken egg bowl aka "Oyakodon" and the hubs ordered the hot duck soba. The serving size was decent, although I must say I had way too much rice and not enough chicken and egg, but overall the food was good. The soba was delicious and I'd probably get that next time I'm in the area. The duck was cooked to perfection and the broth was just perfect, not too watery and not too powerful. Def worth going to if you haven't already...I love the fact they have a great lunch special price and will be coming back for the price!
Helen C.}Brooklyn, NY}83}409}1168}18}4}8/25/2013}Solid lunch spot with their specials and love the hot towel they pass out once you get seated. Get your New York City grime off your hands, order yourself a soba lunch set, relax and enjoy the cozy surroundings. Waitstaff is friendly but unfortunately one star is deducted because they drop the bill on us before we were done eating. I understand they were closing for the afternoon but could you wait until I finish slurping my soba before sending the check our way?
Susing Y.}New York, NY}8}86}0}-1}4}8/24/2013}I came here with a few friends on a Friday night.  The wait was 1.5 hours for 3 people. Food was good though.  I ordered the Kamo Namban Hot Soba Noodles.  We also ordered dessert, which consisted of sesame ice cream with mochi, jelly, red bean, strawberries, and brown sugar syrup.  Delicious.  I would come back here when it's not as busy.
Shelly H.}Cambridge, MA}42}12}2}-1}4}8/21/2013}This is about the weekday lunch experience!1) Go before the rush at 12:30~1 PM2) Nice! Hot towels.3) Get the $17 lunch box set.4) Food coma from all. that. food. A small tempura set, hot/cold SOBA (I mean, come on, it's the namesake!), the bento box of salad, tsukemono, broiled fish, veggies and rice with lots of roe. If you opt for the cold soba, the kind waitress dropped off a teapot of hot water so you can dilute your tsuyu/dipping sauce and drink it off like a starchy broth at the end. :) YUM! 5) Oh, and dessert. That creamy pudding!!I have yet to diverge from this set, but my friends have tried the other sets (don + soba), and attested to their yumminess.
Latef X.}New York, NY}34}516}549}-1}3}8/18/2013}I'm not really sure what the big hype about this place is.  It's just regular soba, and I thought the noodles were a bit overcooked.  Tastes the same as the one I can make at home, and it's pricey.  Crazy that they add surcharges for a tiny amount of garnish that normal places provide for free (e.g., nori strips).  It was decent though, and I did like the box of hot broth they bring at the end to fill up your dipping cup.  Nice way to end the meal.Service was pretty terrible and slow.  You need to flag down a server anytime you need anything, and it's not always such an easy task.
Jin C.}New York, NY}33}997}148}18}3}8/10/2013}I came here on a weekend evening for some dinner because my beloved Upstate had a wait too unbearable for my hungry stomach, and Soba-ya was very pleasantly not crowded at all.Apart from that, there's really nothing to shout about it. I don't think the menu was very special, and the soba I had was just... eh. I felt like I could have gotten a package of dried noodles and made it myself if I bought some ikura from Sunrise. I've had soba at Cocoron and that was really good. The menu was more interesting and I liked the utensils there better.
Winston N.}San Jose, CA}214}6}0}-1}5}8/9/2013}The lunch box is an amazing deal with a great variety of flavors and dishes. I got the cold soba and it went well with the tempura as well as the salmon and rice. The japanese side dishes were presented well and organized into different sections in the lunch box. The strawberry flan that came with the lunch box was the best flan I've ever had. A very small portion which I loved!
M. S.}Manhattan, NY}2}104}56}-1}4}8/7/2013}I was shocked when I tried the uni Toro soba. It was great and had a perfect combination of umami and being filling. The tofu salad... Lettuce needs to be washed thoroughly. Had a few bites of sand. Can't wait to try the agedashi tofu.
Bonnie Y.}Livingston, NJ}180}54}45}-1}4}7/31/2013}What a great find! My experience here was most-excellent. Everything was great, from decor, to food to service. We came for lunch and they had a fantastic menu with many varieties. I ordered a lunch set which includes a rice dish and a choice of udon or soba (served hot or cold). I ordered the tuna sashimi over rice and cold udon served with room-temperature dipping sauce on the side. The tuna was very fresh and they gave a generous portion. The noodles were perfectly made and tasted so fresh. After placing my order, I realized it was silly that I didn't order soba (hence the name of the restaurant). No worries, I will come again!
Josh Q.}San Francisco, CA}33}414}0}-1}4}7/30/2013}Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here.  The noodles are excellent, the meat is excellent, even the barley tea is delicious.  Had nearly no complaints and would gladly return for more.
Diana P.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}51}258}981}-1}3}7/29/2013}I'm just going to come straight out and say it... I'm a soba fan .. the first time I tried soba, i liked it so much I bought a huge bulk of it at the nearby Asian market but Soba-ya was a bit disappointing. I ordered the chicken curry soba and the waiter brought me chicken curry udon ... I kindly reminded the waiter I ordered the soba and it wasn't before long he came back with my order. The noodles were a bit overcooked - not what I would've expected from a Soba specialty restaurant. My friends ordered a cold soba dish with duck that was served with a warm dipping broth and udon claypot. The cold soba dish was probably the best selection out of our entire meal and the udon was also a bit overcooked. Overall experience: just OK ... not so sure I would return though ...
Harba N.}ASTORIA, NY}0}24}0}-1}4}7/28/2013}I mean it's nothing to write home about and a little pricy but the food here is always good. I've tried most of the menu and never had a bad experience.
Carol T.}New York, NY}174}53}82}-1}3}7/18/2013}Came here at 7pm on a Thursday night and just beat the rush of ppl! Here's what i had:Kamo Seiro - cold soba w/ duck & green onion - duck was kinda tough, soup broth was good, soba was good.  I got the small which i think was 100g of soba? for $13.75.  Kind of expensive in my opinion.Dessert:Milk tofu w. strawberry sauce - wasn't a fan of the strawberry sauce & the milk tofu on it's own was meh.honey wasabi - it tasted like wasabi with a slight sweetness =)  interesting.  i liked it.overall an ok place.
Michelle T.}New York, NY}319}971}1072}18}4}7/10/2013}The boyfriend and I came in for lunch on a weekday. Soba-ya, like many of its fellow specialty Japanese restaurants, offers a lunch special that is limited to a certain amount of orders per day. Soba-ya has a Lunch Box Set that is $17.00 for a bucket of food - but there are only 25 servings per day. The box itself comes with four sections - a mixed greens salad with Soba-ya's original dressing, broiled fish of the day, rice with cod roe and egg, and cooked veggies. On the side, you get an order of shrimp tempura and a huge order of cold soba. After you're done with your set, you get a mini panna cotta dessert as well. I thought everything tasted very fresh and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. But most of all, I thought the deal was amazing. You get so much food for just $17.00.
Tiff M.}New Hyde Park, NY}0}44}20}-1}4}7/7/2013}Came here on a weekday with a friend for lunch. While it was filled, there were still a few tables available and after waiting for the tables to be set we were seated.I ordered a seasonal (?) special which was basically katsu curry udon. Katsu and curry both being favorites of mine and this combo being my usual go to item at udon shops, I didn't see why not.The portion size on the noodles was fair in my opinion, definitely left me full, but I can say it doesn't take too much to make me full. The curry soup in the udon was good, and not as sweet as Japanese curry tends to be which I appreciated. The katsu though looked very slightly under cooked (tasted a bit so as well).All in all took off a star for the under cooked meat and the high price. It was around 17 for my dish not including taxes or tip.
Mei C.}Brooklyn, NY}482}321}563}18}3}6/30/2013}Walked around the area, found this place. Décor is pretty authentic Japanese. They serve hot and cold soba noodles. Never had it before, so wanted to try it out. Had desserts already prior to coming to this place. Was already feeling full, so me and my friend decided to order something small. We had the fish cake app, which was more like a gelatin fish cake (gummy like) wasn't really into it. We also got a hot soba noodle bowl with minced meat and mushroom to share. The bowl was good for one person serving, but since we were already full it served us just right. Noodle just wasn't what I was expecting.
Ad. C L.}New York, NY}63}78}42}-1}4}6/27/2013}First, if you are coming for lunch on a weekday, consider coming before 1pm. Before 1pm Soba-ya is probably 40% full. After 1pm it's almost 90% full. Yes you will probably still get a table after 1pm BUT your food will come much faster when there's less people :DAnyway, I came with a friend for Wednesday lunch and we got:Kamo Seiro Soba- REALLY Hot dipping sauce with duck slices in it- Dipping sauce has a great meaty taste, and it's quite yummy to make it into a soup afterwards (they give you hot water to mix in the dipping sauce after the meal)*Lunch Box- Amazing value- First there's the lunch box itself, which has a rice section with salmon roes and egg pieces, some preserved veggie, salad, and a broiled fish- And of course there's the soba and the dipping sauce- And there's tempura with 2 shrimps, a pepper and I think a slice of potato- And a custard dessert- I eat a lot, but the lunch box was a huge portion- ALL FOR $17!!! RECOMMEND!ps. I came to the restaurant at 12:30pm and waited at a table for almost an hour for my friend, and I was surprised I was not even rushed once to order. Bonus points for being chill (besides having chilled soba)Tip 1: They only give out a limited number of lunch boxes every day (I believe 20 or 25). So get it if you can!
Lisa T.}Hayward, CA}55}1267}6}18}3}6/25/2013}Came here once and go the salmon rice bowl. My friend got the soba, it was ok. Nothing really memorable about this place.
Rachel S.}Forest Hills, NY}0}56}0}-1}4}6/24/2013}Tasty appetizers and noodles. My favorite was the tofu salad...fresh ingredients and clean, crisp flavors...definitely more traditional Japanese options that a lot of places around. Reasonably priced and good service. The noodles come in three different sizes which is great for sharing and trying a few things.
Tina Y.}WALL STREET, NY}229}268}2984}-1}3}6/17/2013}Perhaps this place has gone down since the height of it's glory.  My high expectations were quickly shattered.  I always wanted to try this place, but always felt that the prices were a bit high for soba, so the other day while hanging out in the East Village a friend planned on going here for lunch.  I wandered around outside while waiting for our friend and saw that they had a lunch special for $17 which was limited to the first 25 people who ordered.  It was close to 2pm, I thought surely it must have sold out by now.  Shortly after being seated, I asked the waitress if they still had any more lunch specials, she said yes.  Ironically, I didn't end up ordering the lunch special since I got distracted by the uni soba.  When I saw it on the menu, I reminisced of the uni soba I had a Sakagura (special of the day) which was mouth watering-ly delicious.  The uni soba i got here was just uni thrown on top of normal soba and some creme and some seaweed on the side.  As much as I love having Uni, this dish was not integrated well and nothing special.  I could have just ordered the uni side order for $6 and topped whatever soba dish I wanted.The other parties ordered the lunch special, and the charashi soba.  The lunch special seems to be the best deal and looked pretty decent.  The charashi soba bowl was stuffed with toppings.  It's a toss up on whether I want to give this place another try.
Daiki N.}Palisades Park, NJ}134}60}1}-1}4}6/17/2013}Simple. If you feel like traditional hand made soba or udon. This place will satisfy your needs. They have a wide variety of Japanese noodle dishes and located within the east village area (for those that went our drinking).There aren't a lot of great soba-ya (noodle house) in NY, and I think this place will keep me coming back as long as they exist.
Lulu C.}New York, NY}1}41}42}-1}3}6/16/2013}Came here for lunch on a weekday with my lovely manager. We arrived before Sobaya opened in order to prevent the long waiting lines. At 12pm, door opened, we got our seat, ordered our meal, everything got ready in few mins. Well disciplined customer service! ^.^We decided to have Kamo soba ($16) and Lunch box ($17) to share. Kamo soba was one of our original plans, however, the reason we wanted to try lunch box was because it stated in menu that there were limited servings everyday. What? Limited? How can we miss this, right? =PWhile we were waiting for our meals to arrive, there was also a large group of Japanese people waiting for their orders too. The atmosphere was kinda too high for them or what, they were very loudly chatting with each others. I understood that I was dining outside, thus, I shouldn't complain about the noise level. However, today's noise level was kinda too over for me. Oh well.. =/The food arrived, Kamo soba was very good. Soba was very smooth, I could just swallow them without chewing. Soup base was also tasty, light but flavorful, very good soba! Comparing with the amazing Kamo soba, lunch box seems nothing special at all. Sorry for saying this, but me and my manager both believed we could make the same bento box at home. Only the shrimp tempura worth the price, there were two, and we each got one. At least we tried it out and knew what the lunch box had. O.oStill a nice dining experience in the east village. One star deducted because of the lousy level, another star deducted was because the lunch box not worth the limited serving. However, I will definitely come back for their soba. In addition, I will remember to save some spaces in my stomach to enjoy their dessert. =)
VIVIEN C.}Carlsbad, CA}18}65}1}-1}4}6/4/2013}Soba is very good.The wait is acceptable.Just a little pricey I think.
Eric L.}Los Angeles, CA}2}16}0}-1}4}6/3/2013}This is a great restaurant to come and relax with your friends and family.  I've been coming to Sobaya for more than six years, and it is one of my favorite restaurants in East Village.  My wife and I like to come here on a cold and rainy day for the Nabeyaki Udon, which is the best in the city.  I also like their sake oyakodon and tuna steak don as well.
Bertrand M.}New York, NY}4}17}0}-1}5}5/30/2013}My go-to place for Japanese noodles in the East Village. Homemade Soba: you can get a glimpse of the noodle-maker at work if you are lucky. Both Soba and Udon are fantastic. For a rather unconventional appetizer, try the Avocado tempura. Pretty good sake selection. Helpful staff. Highly recommended.
Monica C.}Brooklyn, NY}100}69}99}18}4}5/21/2013}Came here for lunch on a weekday around 3:00pm with the boyfriend because I wanted to try a new soba place. The hostess greeted us in Japanese with a smile, which I appreciated since some places frown at the fact that customers come half an hour before closing (they reopen again for dinner). It wasn't too busy when we got there so we were seated immediately - next to the worker by the entrance making the soba noodles. A waitress came by as soon as we sat down with warm wet towels for us to clean our hands--- super PLUS considering I am a clean freak and that gesture was very much appreciated!It was our first time here so I decided to try their soy cured tuna with mountain yam appetizer. It had an interesting texture-the yam is not the sweet orange yams we are so used to, it was white and had a super sticky consistency. It was served with seaweed and wasabi, you can add soy sauce to taste. The combination of the tuna/yams/condiments made for a delightful little sashimi treat, although it looks like an unappetizing blob of sticky goop once you mix it all together.For the entree, I ordered salmon sashimi with salmon roe lunch box which came with rice as well as a bowl of soba (or udon) noodles - Very nice presentation. My boyfriend ordered the tempura shrimp with rice and soba noodles. The sashimi was pretty good, my first bite had a little fishy taste but not to the point that makes you go "bleh". The soba noodles were so fresh and delicious, however I felt like the broth was a little too salty (MSG?) for my liking, not flavorful as some other places I've been to. My boyfriend enjoyed his tempura but had the same opinion about the broth. We ended our meal with the 3 scoops of ice cream: honey wasabi, black sesame, and green tea. I loved the green tea. The black sesame was ok. I didn't enjoy the honey wasabi too much bc it was too spicy for me. Thank goodness it came with cups of tea to wash everything down. Food was decent. Service was great -- main reason I'm giving Soba-ya 4 stars. I will probably be back to try their cold soba noodles with duck.
Tina Y.}New York, NY}0}196}0}-1}4}5/17/2013}I took my friend here for the early bird dinner special ($18.00, from 5:30 pm to 7 pm) on Wednesday (5/15). My friend arrived at 5:30 pm sharp, but the waitress didn't seat her until I arrived. This was understandable because the early bird special could get very competitive sometimes.I've been going to Soba-ya for over 10 years, and it is always a safe place to go with friends. It is never too loud for conversations, and we can sit comfortably. I've noticed that the quality of lunch special tends to be somewhat inconsistent, but the dinner special never disappoints.I used to order the hot soba, but sometimes I found the broth a bit too salty. So I ordered the cold soba the other day, and I did like it better. Maybe I will start ordering cold soba from now on!
Lelia T.}Brooklyn, NY}92}107}191}-1}4}4/24/2013}Mmm, yummy. First of all, I want to commend the hostess for exceptional service. She greeted me with a smile and friendly recommendations. I thought it would get really crowded for lunch time (which it did) so I asked whether there would be a wait for a party of two. At that time, she said no and asked whether I wanted to be seated. I was surprised she would seat me without a full party because not many restaurants in St. Marks do that. I said sure and took a seat on a two person table. A waitress came by and gave me a hot wet towel to clean my hands which was a nice touch. While perusing the menu, which did have a wide variety, I receive a text telling me that my boyfriend was running late. Not wanting to hold up a table, I just got up with the menus and told the hostess that he was running late and I didn't want to hold the table. She was not at all angry, which really wow'ed me and even thanked me for my courtesy. Plus plus! When we were actually seated like an hour later (-___-), but it wasn't too bad because they have an area where they show you how the fresh soba was rolled and sliced. It was very entertaining, but I was starving and couldn't wait to eat. I got the salmon over rice and my boyfriend got the dipping soba called Tororo. The soba was good and chewy. The broth was a little salty, but tasted good as a dipping sauce. The salmon was very fresh and the roe had a really strong fish taste (which I wasn't THAT fond of, but tasted good with the rice). I had ordered the lunch set which included a clear soup and some radishes for extra charge. In my opinion, the set wasn't worth it. It was basically mildly salted water and like 5 pieces of radishes...  The waitress came by later and explained how the soup for the soba was to be changed into drinkable soup by adding hot water. It diluted the saltiness and actually made it pretty good. She was friendly and clear. Also she was very good with filling up our water and prompt with the check when we asked for it. Overall, it was a good meal. I didn't get to try dessert because I wanted dessert elsewhere, but this is a good place for a light meal. To be honest, Soba-ya is nothing extraordinary, but the good service made my experience better. I would go back.
Kate N.}New York, NY}41}45}5}-1}3}4/23/2013}Solid food and service. Authentic Japanese menu as far as I could tell. But nothing too spectacular. The shoba broth was a bit salty. The service, although very nice, took forever. Desserts were the highlight of the night :)
Kirsten P.}New York, NY}4}36}6}-1}4}4/22/2013}Ooo yum! We had the agendashi tofu, a little cold but good. Then we had the mushroom broth with udon.... Wow! So meaty and delicious and light, will be coming back for that again.We also had cold soba with carrot, ginger, daikon... Order came out wrong first time around but was quickly corrected. Good service, great hot green tea that keeps flowing. Fresh, light, tasty noodle meals with happy customers all around.
Boon K.}Chicago, IL}326}847}8}-1}4}4/21/2013}Freshly made soba noodle and they have these box lunches(bentou) and that feed an army. It was so good but I could barely finish any of the it but I love the soba, thin and a little chewy. I got it cold as that is my preference.
Kelley C.}Philadelphia, PA}29}45}2}-1}4}4/12/2013}Decent soba place!Service was attentive. Menu had a ton of options. I went with cold soba and duck. It was a little twist on the traditional and very good.I would come back!
Robert K.}Newark, DE}17}43}0}-1}4}4/11/2013}Authentic Japanese food.  I was surprised to find several of the menu items, for example umeboshii (pickled plum -- beware, you won't like it!), outside Japan.  Soba can be ordered hot or cold and is top notch.Try the bentou (lunch box) if you're lucky enough to get one before the day's supply of 25 runs out.  The tempura was a little disappointing compared to the excellent other dishes.
Xi L.}Manhattan, NY}25}19}17}-1}4}4/9/2013}Sorry I have to write this review in the midnight.... I was there the day before yesterday for dinner with my friend. It was extremely warm and we ordered cold soba with salmon roe. I highly recommend cold soba if you never try. The soba is drained and cooled and served with dipping sauce made by mainly soy sauce. It's a traditional Japanese food and perfectly good for warm spring days and hot summer. It was also my first meal when I visited Japan form the first time 13 years ago. The environment is very down to the ground but not shabby. The service is very good (like most of the Japanese restaurant ran by Japanese people). I was carrying my gym bag and laptop with me and the receptionist asked me if I need a place to store them and she could watch for me. That was a life savor! They offer hot towel before you order the drinks. They also help explaining the dishes they serve. The only star I took away from them is the size of each serving. I don't know about their size of Donburi (rice bowl) but the regular sized cold soba me and my friend have ordered were so little. Don't get me wrong, the food itself was great. It's just the size. You may still end up starving after one regular serving of soba. Speaking from that, the place is not cheap. Anyway, after I came back home, I decided to make cold soba myself. And I made it yesterday at home, and it tasted almost exactly as what you can have in store and extremely easy (sorry Sobaya but I'm really into Japanese cuisine that I can homemake many of them and cold soba is so much easier than things like Katsudon, Omelet rice and curry. Even Hanami Dango is more complicated than cold soba). If you want to know how, contact me through yelp and I'll see what I can do to help.
Jae C.}Manhattan, NY}145}237}2}-1}4}4/8/2013}This place seems to always be busy but with the variety of Japanese options on the block, the waits never seem to be too bad. The interior is very cozy and makes you feel right at home once you are seated. Staff are prompt and friendly. My last visit, I had a tuna sashimi don since I was craving tuna. Sliced tuna was neatly arranged on top of a soft bed of white rice and seaweed flakes. Texture and flavor of the tuna was fantastic but there was too much rice. The sobas here run a bit on the larger side (even the smalls) and I have never had any complaint. The duck soba and curry sobas stand out as particularly delicious. As an aside, I prefer Soba-ya over Corcoron because of the larger portions. My only complaint is that it runs a bit on the pricey side, but that seems to be the trend with many of the better Japanese restaurants in the area.
Amy D.}Champaign, IL}23}84}3}-1}4}3/31/2013}I went with two friends for dinner on Saturday over Easter weekend.  We originally wanted to go to Ippudo but their projected wait time was a ridiculous ~2 hrs.  It seems that Soba-ya doesn't accept reservations so it's nice because the wait time is usually no more than 20-30 min.Upon sitting down, we were served genmaicha (toasted barley green tea), perfect for the still brisk day.  Noodles are ~12-17 and appetizers are ~10, albeit a bit small for sharing.  Most people would probably be done with a small or regular--it's more food than you anticipate due to the soup.  Appetizers:Sea Urchin: set over a bed of grated taro, the sea Urchin was intensely flavorful.  I personally wouldn't re-order it just because I didn't feel like there was anything special about it but OK if you want sea urchin.Agesashi Tofu: pretty solid though not the best that I've had.  Topped with more taro, ginger, green onions, and dried fish flakes, the lightly battered and fried tofu was set in a subtle sauce.  The flavors blended well and the tofu was really soft.  Just a bit on the bland side, it could have used a tiny pinch of salt.  Overall, a great way to start the meal.Pork Belly: my favorite of the three, the pork belly was savory yet not heavy as can sometime happen with the cut.  The soy sauce wasn't overpowering and it had a nice sweetness to it, probably from mirin.  The sauce was wonderful and we were drinking it at the end even without the pork.Entrees:Kamo Nanban (hot soba): The duck was delicious, reminding me of the Peking Duck that I always get when I'm in Beijing.  Well cooked, with a small layer of fat edging the meat, it was definitely the high-light of the dish.  I did find it a little bizarre, texture-wise, that there was a starchy coating on each slice but perhaps it was used to make sure that the duck retained its flavor in the broth.  The noodles were well cooked and tasty.  The broth was good, although  seemed to lack a certain complexity and was just a tad on the salty side.  Overall, wonderful for a cold day.Soba with Oysters: This was a special while we were there.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed it and loved the broth, finishing every last drop.  I didn't try his dish so can't comment to much on it.Overall, Soba-ya was a great place for dinner.  As with Japanese food, the flavors blended well together without overpowering each other, allowing the ingredients to show through.  I would definitely revisit this place.
Alice C.}Emeryville, CA}49}345}13}-1}4}3/31/2013}I've been here 10 years ago, and it is still maintained its excellence after all these years.The duck soba is always the one to try.Soba is made in house. Everything every is made the old school way, which is getting hard to find these days.Best part is there is no ridiculous wait here and the price is moderate.
Meghan C.}Portland, OR}104}298}93}-1}4}3/30/2013}I'm not a raging expert on Japanese food, but I get the feeling this place is pretty on-point as far as authenticity for two reasons:1. There were were quite a few Japanese people dining here.2. I had no idea how to eat various parts of the meal. Like, that apparently I was supposed to dip my soba into the cold broth, not pour it over the soba. And the teapot they give you at the end is soba water that you can pour into your leftover broth to make a cup of soup. If you're not entirely familiar with the food, you might just have to creep on other diners' tables to figure out the protocol.Cultural confusion aside, the food was really good. I had the lunch set with salmon sashimi, salmon roe, and cold soba. Generous helping of salmon & roe. Super clean flavors and super fresh ingredients. So fresh that you can watch the soba being made as you eat! This style of food is so simple that it would be completely ruined if the ingredient quality was even slightly off. I usually lean toward cuisines with bold flavors, but sometimes the simplicity of Japanese food is a welcome change of pace.I wasn't a big fan of the banchan-like sides. I liked the Japanese sweet potato, but I thought the tuna-like fish was bland and dry.The radish (or turnip?) was just sort of whatever.The service was super attentive, but there was a language barrier and they had difficulty explaining how to eat our soba. Just a minor thing, though. Now I know for next time!
Waz W.}Portland, OR}19}246}320}-1}5}3/29/2013}I'm a huge ramen fan, but I've decided to take a little break from ramen and explore soba. I'm also going vegetarian for 2013, and soba is generally more veggie friendly. Naturally, Soba-ya was first on the list of soba spots to try. Located a couple blocks away from Ippudo, I suspect soba-ya is a popular backup for noodle fanatics. The menu was almost overwhelming. We started with some tempura. I only ate the veggie tempura. Fresh veggies and a light crispy batter. What's there not to love? My friend ordered the Kamo Seiro Soba ($16). The soba was cold, but the duck dipping sauce was hot. She ordered the large, which came with 2 gigantic trays of soba! I ordered the large Yasai Hot Soba ($13.50), which was packed full with mushrooms and vegetables. The broth was too salty to drink on its own, but was quite lovely with the soba and veggies. Very comforting on a chilly winter's day. Soba-ya, I'll be back!
Cally S.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}3/28/2013}One of my favorite go to places for soba. They are always consistent in their service and food! They make their soba noodle bowls just perfect each time, and you can see that they make it in house. Not a overly pricey place and the ambience is ok but it is clean and the food is good!
Daisy W.}Brooklyn, NY}41}17}20}-1}1}3/23/2013}I have to give this place one star based on my experience. But I might be wrong. The food we ordered was terrible.  Other than sushi, I'm not a fan of Japanese food.  Almost all the Japanese restaurants I went, I end up disappointed.  I like ramen, so I ordered the oyster Udon (don't remember the full name, but please if you see my review, don't try this noodle...). We also ordered appetizers like sesame tofu (no taste at all!! )and steam egg (Way too salty!!!). Sadly, NONE of them are good... If I was not desperately hungry, I would leave those food alone forever.  And I heard girls next table kept blaming the taste of food was not good. So I guess I'm not the only one.I don't understand why the rating here is so high.  But I'll never come back again.
Ed L.}Manhattan, NY}1183}348}644}-1}4}3/11/2013}I love Soba-ya.  It's Soba-licous!  I've been coming to this spot for over a decade to feed my need for speed (actually, I meant Soba).  In fact, I'm typing up this review right around the corner and may have to satisfy my cravings (for Soba, not speed).  When you first walk into the venue, the host/hostess and staff will greet you in classic Japanese fashion.  This politeness extends to every aspect of their service.  The decor is classically minimal, which lends to a soothing ambiance.  This was my go to first date spot for quite a while, especially if someone has never had soba before.  If you're not sure how to dip cold soba and how to use the broth afterwards, just ask.  Also, don't be afraid to slurp as it is the custom.  In addition to a great dinenr menu, I like to go to Soba-ya for their lunch special.  You'll get your noodles with a bento box filled with tempura, fish and a selection of seasonal vegetables.  Yum.  Yeah, I think I'm going to have to wrap this review up to get my Soba on.When I first came to this place, they used to roll and cut the soba in front of the customers, I don't know if they still do it, but it was quite the show.    Show or no show, I recommend Soba-ya, for a refined evening out that won't break the bank.  Tell them Ed sent you.  They'll look confused and won't know what you're talking about, but it's worth a try.P.S. I'm really proud of that "It's Soba-licous!" line and will be treating myself to a lunch special shortly.  Sayonara y'all!
Cinthia K.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}191}566}250}18}5}3/3/2013}I really really enjoyed my meal here.I came here 2 weeks ago for my lunch break. I came here a little after 12PM, so I was able to get seated right away. Within half an hour of me getting there, though, I did notice that the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. My suggestion for those that don't want to wait would to be to get there as early as possible.I decided to get one of their lunch specials. I chose the mini veg tem don set, which came with a bowl of rice topped with vegetable tempura, a smaller bowl of hot soba with broth, and an assortment of pickles and raw veggies. Quite a nice set of assorted foods. Upon my first bite, I knew I was a fan. I've got a soft spot for traditional Japanese meals that revolve around rice and lightly seasoned vegetables (probably has something to do with the fact that I am Korean and grew up eating Korean food, which resembles this kind of Japanese cuisine). At the risk of sounding super pretentious, I felt like I was transported back to Shibuya or Roppongi Hills, which was where I had similar meals.So, yeah, I was a fan. The service was also prompt and friendly. I liked the decor here and I can't wait until I dine here again.
Valerie L.}New York, NY}164}335}8}18}3}3/2/2013}I used to come to this restaurant for their tartar bowl, which was amazing and my favorite dish of all time. But they don't have it anymore or anything similar to it, so I haven't been frequenting Soba-ya as often as I used to. When I do come here, I order the Kamo Namban- the broth is good and so is the duck, but it doesn't stand out. The restaurant itself is cute and the servers are diligent. Overall, Soba-ya provides a mediocre restaurant/soba experience- I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.
Will R.}Portland, OR}87}528}25}18}2}2/28/2013}After much hype and an enthusiastic suggestion from a close friend the wife and I tried this place. Usually we go to our go-to Japanese place on 8th st. Cho Cho San. Needless to say we were very disappointed. The noodle making in the front window foreshadowed wonderful things, the foul smell at the entrance foreboded more ill fated ones. The latter proved to be true. We shrugged off that weird odor and took our seats at the bar. This is the moment when I ordered the best thing of the night, a soba beer. Apparently the Japanese make this very special hefeweizen from their native wheats. And I'll be damned, it was tasty just like the Bavarians ones are!!! From there though, all downhill. Our starters were some tempura I was hearing and reading so much about. They were tasteless soggy crumpling things. There were no squid as advertised, jut broccoli, carrots, and some other unidentifiable vegetables (not tasty). Our soba noodle soups were even worse- overly salty water with some fish balls (not good at all) and my duck (chewy and tasteless, the antithesis of goo duck). The waitstaff was attentive and helpful though. I am somewhat ignorant on the noodle thing, but I know that I didn't like these at all. If you do go, make sure you get a soba beer. It might be the only redeeming thing of your night......
William H.}FOREST HILLS, NY}85}35}0}-1}4}2/27/2013}By far the best dish here is the Hot Sobaya with Duck. I've been here a few times and this place rocks every time. You can order either a small or large bowl of each ramen dish and for the most part, the small will suffice. If you love noodle dishes you won't be disappointed here. Consider this one of the best comfort food places.
Laura H.}Sydney, Australia}357}394}3}-1}4}2/25/2013}When you are hungover there really isn't anything better than noodles.  Yet again I tried to get into Ippudo at TWO IN THE AFTERNOON ON A MONDAY and the wait was still two hours.  This place is outrageous... so I looked up the next best thing and Soba-ya it was.  My friend and I met for a rehash of last night's events over a platter of seaweed salad and a lunch box.  SO much food for $14 if you do the lunch box.  I ordered the tuna sashimi one which came with huge chunks of fresh fish, veggies, and a sizable bowl of hot soba OR udon noodles (I went with udon).  I was so warm and full and happy by the end of this meal that I was barely able to drag my fat ass back to work.  GREAT option for lunch.
Eileen Y.}New York, NY}16}10}0}-1}2}2/21/2013}I ordered the Kamo Namban (duck soba) and was pretty underwhelmed. The duck was hard to chew and the broth was too salty. I felt like my noodles were drenched in soy sauce and wound up drinking a lot of water. Overall, I'd probably try other noodle places in the area before coming back for another round.
Sandra S.}Los Angeles, CA}287}91}0}-1}1}2/21/2013}The soba was decent.  I got the hot soba with the butter flakes/fishcakes, and it was just the thing for a freezing evening in February.What was NOT okay was the scrap metal I found in my soup.  It was a rough, twisted piece of thin sheet metal, and I found it while chewing the noodles.  I cannot tell you how disturbed I was/am/will always be.  What's worse is that I encountered it when I had almost finished my bowl of soba!  I alerted the waiter, who took the piece of metal, then whisked my bowl away.  Instead of being mortified and passionately apologetic, all of the waiters just seemed kind of embarrassed, like they couldn't wait for me to leave and put this all behind me.  My waiter wordlessly dumped a free bowl of ice cream on my table, then proceeded to act as though I had not just almost choked on a piece of scrap metal.Having lived in Japan, I am aware that this is probably a cultural thing, but this is America.  And a customer's health and safety is worth more than a bowl of ice cream.
Darren R.}New York, NY}6}127}49}-1}4}2/18/2013}I heard of this noodle shop years ago.  I came in here starving, so I decided to do something I don't usually do and order an appetizer.  I usually don't because most of the time it's overpriced on purpose for the impatient.  But I wanted to try the tuna tartar.  Unfortunately it tasted like they just pulled it out of the freezer.  It literally still had ice crystals in it.  Well thankfully my hot soba noodle Cashari soup was so delicious, I nearly overfilled.  I had to will myself away from drinking down the broth.  I'll be back for more, but no appetizer.
Chloe L.}New York, NY}2}87}55}-1}4}2/5/2013}I was recently introduced to Japanese Soba and I am hooked. I've been to Cocoron for the first time and wanted to try this place to compare. This place is def nicer but too damn pricy for just noodles and soup.  Don't think I'll come back here since Cororon is better and cheaper.
Steve B.}Brooklyn, NY}66}201}0}-1}5}2/4/2013}Best Zaru Soba you will find in the city. Noodles are rich, nutty, smoky, complex, awesome in every way. My favorite part is when you get the soba noodle water to use to turn your dipping sauce into an after-dinner soup of sorts.
V U.}Manhattan, NY}5}82}0}-1}4}1/24/2013}Overall, I'm a fan of the Kamo Namban (hot sobaya with duck). I thought the noodles were extremely good but the broth was a bit salty for my taste.I also tried the tempura appetizer and that was good... you can't really go wrong with tempura right?
Yichen C.}New York, NY}82}58}0}-1}4}1/24/2013}East Village is a magical place. Land in any Japanese restaurant there and you get amazed. Wow. Honestly I was not expecting much from sobaya when I walked in, but it truly outdid its appearance. We had the uni tororo (sea urchin with yam) and goma (sesame) tofu as starters. I was driven speechless by the uni tororo - the yam is grated and cooked to such perfection that it kind of ruined yam from any other restaurant for me, not to mention the magical effect when it's mixed with sea urchin. I'd strongly recommend this dish for people who are afraid to try natto (Japanese soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis; I had to pull this definition from wiki) because of its strong flavor. This is the closest resemblance you could get to Natto in texture, but it doesn't have Natto's strong smell that drives people crazy. Seriously, this dish alone makes the restaurant stand out. Goma tofu is a house-made tofu that's chewy in a good way, and very tasty. For the noodles, we had a duck udon called kamo-nanban with extra sea urchin and egg, and a seafood soba with extra slices of duck meat. Loved both. Not a single reason for complaint. The chef used scallions and miso/soy sauce in a masterful way and made duck meat, which is normally overly rich an fatty, taste really good.Guys, definitely try this restaurant.
Kat D.}Astoria, NY}52}280}35}18}2}1/24/2013Updatedreview}Disappointed at the latest visit. They took away some of the best menu items and the service has gone down. I'll stick with Cocoron, at least it has character (and tofu!)
Anna K.}New York, NY}0}7}4}-1}2}1/19/2013}Finally, I made it to this place today after living in NYC over 10yrs. As a Tokyo-born Japanese, unfortunately I have to say their soba was very disappointing... The soba sauce didn't have enough saltiness/sweetness at all, no flavor of Bonito/Niboshi(dried fish) either. Addition to that, my cold soba was way too cold (icy cold) which is not the right way. (Never had that cold soba/any noodle in my life) And, soba itself didn't have an aroma of buckwheat at all... Even though I was starving and was so excited to have soba that day, I couldn't finish a 2/3 of the mid-small bowl of it. I wanted to take my parents to this place whenever they visit me next time, but it seems like that's not gonna happen... ;(
Arlene Y.}New York, NY}506}255}135}18}5}1/13/2013}modest little restaurant, tucked away in a little street near east village, it is easily missable, I literally walked   past the place a couple of times before I finally found it.  After I found this place and tried the soba noodles I was in love! Been here multiple times, and I recommend: 1) Kamo Namban-- Hot soba noodles with duck. THe duck is so tender and it just melts in your mouth,  noodles are cooked to perfection, and the broth is flavorful.  (this is and will always be my favorite dish) 2) Tempura- same broth as Kamo Namban, but you get a side of crunchy tempura with shrimp and various veggies. 3) Agedashi Tofu -- fried tofu in a flavorful broth (appetizer) 4) Sesame Icecream - deliciousness apparently now they also have an early bird special from 5:30-7:00  18 dollars for 5 courses- must try this hands down my favorite noodle place!
May Z.}New York, NY}11}64}0}-1}4}1/7/2013}Ate here because Ippudo was closed. What a pleasant surprise. Ordered the Udon and it was delicious. For dessert, I had the milk tofu. Wow. A new favorite.  Note that since everything is homemade, it takes a very long time for the food to come out. Spent about 1.5 hours at my table during a 1:30pm lunch. Worth it though, especially if you're not in a hurry. Delicious.
Nora M.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}0}25}0}-1}4}1/6/2013}Soba-ya is a perennial favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. The shoji-screened, bamboo-paneled interior, replete with small traditional alcoves, or "tokonoma", is as warm and inviting as the soba noodles served. If you head for the East Village in search of one of those experiences that transport you into another culture, this place will do the trick. You don't have to be a borderline-creepy, white male Japano-phile with mangas and Miyazaki DVD's clogging the bookshelves to appreciate the attention paid here to Japanese details and atmosphere. Even on a busy night, when it's packed to the rafters and conversational din and noodle-smacking reverberate off the walls, a sense of calm still seems to prevail. You'll always be able to hear your date - if you're into that sort of thing.P.S. The "stamina noodles" pack a delicious garlicky punch. You'll want the large bowl.
David C.}Campbell, CA}85}413}14}-1}4}1/3/2013}Literally in-and-out of this place in 20 minutes at 11 PM or so. Shared a cold plate of soba. I don't know if this soba was AWESOME or we were eating such heavy / rich / creamy foods, but we were almost racing to take possession of them cold noodles...at least I was... Noodles were like $12 or something, maybe less. I think the waiter was a little disappointed: "One?" in disbelief. Yeah buddy, this is actually my fifth dinner, I might hurl if I stand up too quickly.   I like Soba-ya a lot though, for what it's worth. It's on a street with a bunch of places that end with "-ya." Pretty funny, actually, I heard the owners own the entire street, straight out of Gangs of New York. "This is my street-ya!" The soba is solid but I've never met a cold buckwheat noodle I didn't like-ya dig? I will stop now.
Priscilla T.}Manhattan, NY}104}580}8}18}4}12/22/2012}Love the wood decor and vibe inside (and out). Soba was great as well. I loved the portion size options and the variety on the menu. My foodie friend and I tried pretty much every category on the menu: sashimi, hot soba, cold dipping soba, tempura, and dessert. Yum's all around :)
Yue P.}Manhattan, NY}3}3}1}-1}2}12/14/2012}I tried tortoro hot noodle and it was way too plain. Also the salmon sashimi was not fresh enough. Don't go if you like spicy noodle soup because they don't have any. The price was not acceptable for this quality of food ($11 for my small size noodle soup which I think $5 might be more appropriate). I don't get why they have such a high rating, maybe I expected too much.
P H.}Grand Prairie, TX}2104}1595}4321}-1}2}12/9/2012}Decor: 4/5-Love the wood decor, chairs and tables.Service: 3/5-We were seated 15 minutes prior to closing and they were kind enough to let us order anything on the menu granted we all ordered at the same timeFood: 2/5-Tortoro hot noodle with grated mountain yam. The broth was flavorful though salty. I could only take a few bites before giving up. The soba noodles were thin and bland. I prefer Cocoron's soba noodles.I can see why the most recent Yelp reviews have claimed Soba-ya's quality has gone downhill.-Uni tororo (Fresh sea urchin & Grated mountain yam) was interesting. The yam tasted like sticky cold grits. The uni was alright. Worth $9.50? No thanks.-Satsuma-imo (cooked japanese sweet potato) was the best dish here at $6.00. Not overly sweet, just right with a slightly firm consistency that doesn't break apart when picked up with chopsticks. I'll be back just for this!
Kenny C.}New York, NY}353}219}389}-1}2}12/7/2012}I didn't try the soba here, this review is for the tuna carpaccio. We came for a light snack after filling up with hot wings and beer. Id like to return to try the soba. Those at our table who did order soba said it was just mediocre.Service: 4/5No complaints!Warm mint scented hand towels Decor: 4/5 Warm, wood trim, clean, cozyFood: 2.5/5 - I had the salmon carpaccoio $12 (yelp.com/biz_photos/soba…)- 4 bite sized servings (refer to picture) each composed of two thin (~2mm) slices of atlantic farmed salmon over a bed of green onions in a bath of yuzu sauce- I was thoroughly disappointed. Although the salmon was fresh, portion size was lacking and they used farmed atlantic salmon, this isn't an all you can eat sushi joint, what gives?- yuzu sauce was tangy and delish - over a bed of green onions, the onions were cut chunky and the flavor really overpowered the subtleness of the fresh salmon, all I could taste was green onion really. I would have preferred some watercress(was there any in there? didnt seem like it) Tuna tartare:- I had a taste of Gloria C's tuna tartar,- nice presentation, it was layered well- taste was bland and unseasonedI expected much more out of of a Michelin rated restaurant. Ill come back to try the soba sometime, maybe, or maybe ill just save my money for the less expensive and super delicious cocoron.
Andrew J.}Manhattan, NY}204}143}401}-1}3}12/5/2012}Soba-ya was alright. It's a bit expensive for what it is but the flavor seems authentic, albeit a bit bland. I like this place when I feel like I need to detox/eat healthy. Maybe I just don't like this type of food?
Fionna W.}Brooklyn, NY}12}79}16}-1}5}11/28/2012}Gotta come early or wait- we're waiting, for not too long and enjoy the amazing soba!!!Brush up on your chopstick etiquette! Don't be afraid to slurp,and get the soba! It really was as awesome as all the reviews are saying it is.
Judy L.}Denver, CO}119}682}85}18}3}11/26/2012}Sadly, didn't live up to its hype for us. The food was tasty but didn't wow us. Small tempura appetizer - tasted much more authentic than I can usually get in Boston. Fresh. Not overly fried. Tasty. Seasonal special mushroom soba - not really used to having soba in soup. The noodles felt a little too soft for me. Duck udon - surprised that the duck slices were dry and hard to chew. The broth wasn't as light as I prefer. Una don - best part of the meal. The mini eel bowl was very delicious. The flavor was just right and had a good fish to sauce to rice ratio. The wait was about 30 minutes on Saturday at 7pm.
Tiffany Y.}San Francisco, CA}323}371}58}-1}3}11/25/2012}Came here last night (Saturday).  When we got there at 6:10, there was no wait.  But by the time we left, the entrance was crowded by people waiting to get seated.I ordered the seasonal mushroom soba but thought it was pretty plain, just mushrooms and soba.  I had to add quite a bit of pepper to add any flavor.I thought the highlight of the meal was an appetizer (soup with mushroom, fish, and shrimp) that came in something that looked like a teapot.
JENNY P.}New York, NY}35}38}13}-1}4}11/24/2012}Great, clean, noodles! I had the nabeyaki and it was the best I've ever had. Minus one star for making me wait for an hour and 15 minutes in the cold...brrr!
Emma G.}Atlanta, GA}64}207}4}-1}5}11/24/2012}Amazing soba! Lovely ambience, from the hot towel you are handed at the beginning of your meal to the soba chef making the noodles right in the dining room by where you are sitting. My friend and I did the "early bird special" which is a wonderful prix fix deal if you eat dinner before 7:30 on weeknights. $18 for a tasting of four appetizers (delicious- pickled lotus root, and three other wonderful things that I can't remember but were delights), a giant bowl of soba (hot or cold), tons of tempura, two sweet tofu skin rice rolls, and dessert!The only irritating thing was that the only dessert on the prix fix menu is ice cream- can't do because I have a dairy allergy- and they were completely unwilling to possibly substitute something else. It's okay though. I was bursting at the seams from all the other food and I didn't need dessert.The noodles are so ridiculously fresh (duh, they're made in front of you at a little table in the dining room) that they actually start swelling up in the broth if you don't eat them fast enough. Slurp away!
Bianca P.}New York, NY}38}21}6}-1}5}11/17/2012}This is actually my first review. I was so impressed with the service that I had to share it. Of course the food was yummy, but lots of food is yummy. The service was the highlight here:1. Walked in around 7 on a Saturday night with one friend. The hostess told us it would be a 20-30 minute wait and took down my phone number so she could call us when the table was ready (this is a pretty nice system... that way you don't just have to stand around). We got halfway down the street and got a call that the table would be ready in 5 minutes-awesome! 2. We were a bit overwhelmed by the menu (I missed the cute illustrated guide they have at Cocoran), but the waiter helped us figure out what to get. 3. Auto warming toilet seat! What? This is ridiculous, but surprisingly pleasant.4. This was the most outstanding part. I had a good deal of food leftover, so I asked the waiter to box it up so I could take it home. After getting our receipts back, I still hadn't gotten my leftovers, so I was worried that they had thrown them out by mistake. The waiter came back and told me that they had, indeed, thrown them out... so they were making me a new order (and it was fast). Awesome... soba all week!
Jeffrey C.}New York, NY}221}94}85}-1}5}11/13/2012}One of two great soba places in the city...and both are down in the East Village.  I get to here a lot more than Soba-koh.  I've loved this place since it first opened and make my way here several times a year to get my fix.If you can swing it, the early bird is a great deal!
J A.}Burbank, CA}251}5}0}-1}4}11/11/2012}they make their own buckwheat noodles. i had hot soba noodles  soup with shrimp tempura, and added half boiled egg, It was very good! not spicy, or dashi (stock) was just right. Just a lil wish is that they could give out some more negi. Overall, I think food from this place is somewhat authentic.
Isabelle D.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}4}11/4/2012}Love this place. Went for the 16-buck mini lunch special and there was nothing mini about it. The place is quaint and clean and was, at the time of my visit, full of Japanese customers (always a good tip off). Around that price buys you a standard size bowl of hot or cold udon or soba along with a rice dish if your choice. I got the unagi rice with hot soba. Little toppings and dishes were included such as slices of yam, lotus root, pickled relish, carrots and cucumbers. The soba was good. Maybe slightly overlooked but only because I love a tougher noodle. The eel was delicious though I would have preferred a little more sauce over the rice though I'm sure they would have granted me exactly that if I would have asked. No complaints about the service. The waitresses were sweet and abiding. We were also seated quite quickly though considering lunch time rush hour was over, I wouldn't have expected anything too different. Did I mention this was on a Sunday? Lunch specials still exist on Sundays. Will definitely be returning. Over and over. Reasonable and more than worth it.
Wayne L.}Washington, DC}235}272}607}18}5}11/1/2012Updatedreview}I love this place and have been here several times now and it still continues to impress me.  So upping my review to 5 stars.  Everything I've had here over multiple visits has been amazing.  Soba, lunch sets, sushi/sashimi.  It's all so good.Soba-ya is a pretty small space given it's popularity though.  So if you're coming with a big group (larger than 6) come early.  You'll notice people starting to stand outside and line up before the place opens.  So get in line and prepare yourself for a great meal.
Hannah H.}New York, NY}55}80}246}-1}4}11/1/2012}Five stars for the food!! Three stars for the service. Una Qi and Seafood Udon are awesome!! Around 30 USD per person.
Johanna C.}New York, NY}118}157}72}-1}4}10/29/2012}Solid 4-star restaurant.  Definitely has an authentic Japanese atmosphere, from the employee greetings to the food itself.  I had the mini chicken katsu don, because I wasn't that hungry, and it was the perfect amount.  The dish only had a few peices of chicken but was covered in egg/omelette over rice.  It had great flavors and I would definitely have this again.My husband had a lunch box which came with a strawberry milk tofu dessert which he gave to me.  It was very delicious and sweet and was beautifully presented.I went with a group, and most of my friends ordered the lunch set mini which came with an entree and soba noodle which everyone loved.  I would definitely go back here and try some more dishes.
Franklyn9 B.}Torrance, Los Angeles, CA}0}15}0}-1}4}10/23/2012}One thing that drawn me here is the handmade soba they have in  specialized. Had their lunch box and dinner with my friends in 2 weeks, like their lunch box big portion @ $17. I enjoy eating it a lot, especially how everything is presented nicely.As for the dinner I went, probably we went @ the peak hour, so the food took longer than usual but the quality was great. We had chawan mushi, duck soba, seasonal mushroom tempura, uni-tororo soba, buta kakuni, maguro yamakake, and ika meshi. Except the ika meshi and uni-tororo soba are not as I imagined, others are pretty good for a normal New Yorker (since I've tried better in LA).
JiaJia T.}Hauppauge, NY}409}385}557}18}4}10/16/2012}Came here on an early weekend dinner and had to wait for about 15 minutes.  Not too bad. Had chawan mushi, seaweed salad, Yasai soba, and a nabeyaki udon.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the broth was savory.  Great meal on a rainy chilly evening.
Elaine L.}New York, NY}83}140}57}-1}4}10/15/2012}This is where I will eat my soba. Duck. Yuba. Taro. Monk Fish Liver.
David P.}Manhattan, NY}67}431}292}-1}2}10/15/2012}noodles were just OK...not A-OKnot impressed with places that nickel and dime you. For example, had soba with literally 6-8 short narrow strips of seaweed. asked for some more seaweed which was 50 cents more. considering how little they initially put on the noodles, I ordered $1 worth of extra seaweed which was adequate.seriously? extra charge for strips of seaweed? at least when you pay an extra $2 for rice at an asian place, you become slightly fuller.don't even get me started on what they consider a chicken rice bowl 'set' meal.
Bo W.}San Francisco, CA}0}25}0}-1}4}10/14/2012}If you are in NYC, you have to come here for lunch.  The lunch set is a good deal.  Plus the dessert in the lunch set is my fave.  The handmade soba is their specialty so make sure you order this.
L K.}Cambridge, MA}7}129}0}-1}5}10/13/2012}Wonderful and warm customer service.  Delicious soba noodles (and healthy too).  The bathroom was clean. Decor was inviting and calming.  Dessert was the best part--try the milk and strawberry dessert!
C H.}Austin, TX}1}19}0}-1}5}10/10/2012}I had been craving curry noodles since a trip to Tokyo this summer, and I finally found a delicious bowl of curry udon here. Perfect and heavenly!
Vanessa T.}Honolulu, HI}155}447}14}-1}5}10/2/2012}Soba-ya is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. The lunch special salmon sashimi donburi + soba combo is only $14 and is the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The quality of the sashimi is just so much better in Japanese restaurants because their standards are higher. I opted for the cold soba and it was refreshing and chewy. It's the perfect meal for a warm day. For dessert I ordered the honey wasabi ice cream which was weird but somewhat enjoyable. The wasabi aftertaste was interesting. I got a taste of their version of a panna cotta (milk pudding) and that is the dessert to get. I wish I ordered that instead of the spicy ice cream. This is one of those places I can't stop talking about and I'm already thinking about bringing friends here!
Eva L.}Jersey City, NJ}72}92}4}-1}5}9/30/2012}Yes, I questioned myself if there food is worth what I paid for. There is a sign that some of their stuff is slightly overpriced. BUT I found out it might all because I didn't know when to go, and what to order!Generally, I feel that there's always more soba than udon. I happened three time when I went with a friend and she finished her udon before me (I always have soba).Try to go there during lunch time. You will find that there's a huge price drop on some of their combos. I think I paid total $20ish for 1*Unagi Don+4*miniappitizer+1*traditional soba. It was a great deal.I've also tried their $10-to-choose-three appetizer, duck soba, and chirashi sushi. yummy!!!!! The chirashi was BIG. Couldn't finish that by myself..Service is pretty good. Food is delicious. and price can be good too!!!
Meriann S.}New York, NY}1}5}0}-1}5}9/26/2012}One of my favorite spots in the city.  The lunch special and early bird dinner specials are a great deal!  I usually get the Nabeyaki Udon.  Everything is delicious and authentic.
Ange H.}Manhattan, NY}0}11}0}-1}4}9/25/2012}Nice decor - it was not crowded.  Had  the Monday soba special - next time will try a cold dish. The black sesame ice cream was nice with the soba chips!
Wendy G.}Minato, Japan}238}721}1145}18}4}9/23/2012}I came here on a whim for Sobaya's special lunch set on a Sunday. The ambiance was relatively relaxing, certainly good enough for someone in the mood to indulge in their food alone.The menu selection was abundant and very authentic Japanese, but NOT the food themselves.I got the lunch set Salmon Oyako don which is essentially salmon sashimi and salmon fish roe on top.I was disappointed to see the rice was not even sushi rice; the soba's texture is worse than the ones I cook myself at home; oh the little amount of sides was just odd and not refreshing at all.On the other hand, the presentation was excellent, in part, which explains why New Yorkers like this place.I just want to point that out - don't be easily fooled by the looks! People have been mentioning that Soba-ya quality going downhill these years. I could totally imagine that. Presentation is easy to fake, but when the quality of ingredients is bad, there's no way you could make delicious meals out of it.Food is not cheap there, so please be more selective and thoughtful when it comes down to cooking!
Alex R.}Aurora, CO}37}30}20}-1}5}9/22/2012}Went here a few weeks ago and have been craving it non stop since! The store front is small and easy to miss if you aren't looking for it, but it's necessary to go looking for it. I had a noodle bowl with soba noodles and braised duck, it was AMAZING! My girfriend had noodles and fresh tuna, which she hasn't stopped talking about since we went. We dont often go to the eas village, but when we are there we will be coming here to eat.
R Y.}Manhattan, NY}43}270}340}-1}4}9/18/2012}Delicious, but I keep asking myself, is it worth what I paid for??For appetizer, my friend and I picked from the seasonal menu. It was raw salmon wrapping greens (leek or lemon grass). It was pretty delicious. Only thing i would change is that less of the greens (which you cane pick out yourself), so that's just me being picky.For entree, I order 2 small dishes - 1 small soba and 1 small oyako don. They were both delicious, but personally the soba wasn't anything special. Also, I definitely had better sauce to dip my noodles. Theirs was very plain and no unique note to it. The okyako don (chicken with egg and onions) was okay as well. I asked for the egg to be runny, but it was still more on the cooked side. Oh well.My friend ordered their soba with duck. It was good. She wasn't starving after eating it, but she did have munchies afterwards, which is perfect because we could go get dessert.Either way, good was pretty good. The food was more fresh and tasted better than many other soba/ Japanese places. However, it's not on the top of my list to go on a weeknight dinner, but if you never been and are curious, go take a look. You wont' hate it, but you can decide for yourself if you'll love it.
C T.}Neihu District, Taiwan}5}42}1183}-1}5}9/17/2012}This is my favorite place for soba in the NYC. I am always a big fan of ramen/noodle/pasta/soba shops that make their own noodles/pasta (specially if they know what are they doing). There are kind of unic and destin texture that I can hardly find from the premade or dry noodles/pasta. I like how Soba-ya make their own soba right in the dinning area. I also like their extend selections of hot and cold soba. A very nice list of domburi (rice bowls) is definitely a big plus to me.One side note, while their soba taste great when served cold. It gets too soft very fast if you let the soba stay in the hot broth too long which happened on me when I had both rice bowl and the hot soba to finish.By the way, a reviewer has mentioned previously at here that the combination of tororo (Japanese yam) and uni (sea urchan) with soba can be kind of weird... For me, they do go alone very will when is over rice. However, with soba, I have tried them on cold soba which was great. I will probably not recommend them to be served with hot soba. Sliming, creaming, and hot broth with soft soba... Hmm... That can be a tough texture combination to sell for many people.
Dennis L.}Philadelphia, PA}336}303}143}18}3}9/9/2012}Not so bad, but not so great. I ordered the sea urchin cold soba with grated yams. Generally I like grated yams, but I think I prefer it over rice by itself. When mixed with the soba soup that is dumped on there and uni, it just tasted weird. I probably ate it incorrectly, but I even asked the waitress if there was a best practice style of eating it and she said to just dump the sauce in, so I did!All in all, i probably would not go back. They wouldn't let me eat my otafuku i bought while waiting, and then they seated my party while I was order (of course), even though it's the same owner! I confirmed with the otafuku manager and the waitress, but they didn't care. I understand the policy, but shiiiii I ordered a $20 soba dish. Should just let me eat my octopus balls.
Jenna L.}San Diego, CA}107}505}0}-1}4}9/6/2012}We woke up a little bit late on our last day in New York.  Decided that we needed to hit all the places we had on our list that we hadn't had a chance to hit yet.   We hadn't decided whether we wanted to go to Cocoron or Soba-ya yet, both of which specialize in soba.  We looked up hours and found that Cocoron was actually closed on Mondays, so it made our choice much easier.  We headed over to Soba-ya and waited a couple minutes for it to open since we got there a few minutes early.  We were the fist customers in, and we ordered pretty quickly after sitting down.  It was raining outside (Yep, in August) so we all opted for hot soba even though I really prefer cold soba anyday.  I got the kamo negi, cooked duck and green onion.  It was pretty good - the duck flavor in the broth was the best part.  I am not really a huge fan of hot soba, so I should have gone with the cold dipping soba, but I wanted to try it hot here for some reason (must have been the rain).  Pretty good flavors though.  Cooked duck in soup kind of has a slimy texture on the outside, which was kind of strange, but I got over it.  Overall, I enjoyed it, and respected that they made their own noodles and liked watching the guy making the noodles from our table, but I think next time the cold noodles are the way to go.
Gail Anthony T.}Jersey City, NJ}77}155}25}-1}4}9/3/2012}My favorite soba spot in the city.  What's nice, you get to see the fresh soba rolled up and cut up in front of the restaurant.  The kamo (duck) soba is where it's at!  My son had his first experience with soba here; now he eats it at least 3x a week.
Sharlene C.}Brooklyn, NY}73}668}84}-1}3}9/3/2012}popped in for a dinner with an out of towner.  i had rice in a soba spot.  i got rice with salmon sashmi and roe.  mmmm.  it was a generous helping and my noodle eating pals were jealous of my selection.  i'll be back to try the main attraction.
Janssen W.}Costa Mesa, CA}108}30}16}-1}3}9/2/2012}Look, I have been a fan of Soba-ya and have been going here for years. But its sort of like an old friendship that is showing cracks and wear that need repair and retuning.Last night, they were having their end of summer special and so it was extraordinarily louder than I have ever remembered it to be. They also had a girl over in the front entrance dressed in a kimono selling Japanese soda and playing some Japanese(?) drum music on her Macbook Pro. Anyway, it looked all a little too tacky. On this particular night, the waitstaff also seemed brisk: solely order taking and not really all that helpful.The space itself is a small and beautifully simple bamboo framed area with a soba noodle bar. The food here is very good and very reasonable. If you get the soba (hot or cold), you won't be disappointed but you won't be blown away either. Soba-Koh, Soba Totto, and Seo are all better. FYI - You should know NEVER get soba from a non-Japanese ethnically owned/runned/outfitted restaurant. They always f#c2 up the broth and tastes like ti#s water.
Elaine C.}Seattle, WA}194}182}9}-1}5}9/1/2012}That's soba!? Whoa.  It's so fresh! My bf and I stumbled upon this restaurant after staring at a blank screen in the theater on 14th for 30 minutes before management declared it's projector broken and unable to play the 3 hour batman movie for which we had alloted our time. Fortunately, east village was right around the corner with random, amazing options such as Soba-ya! How I have not yet discovered this until now is shocking to me. It hit me I've probably been cooking soba all wrong (overcooked)!My bf got the cold soba and I got a hot soba (yasai). Both were delicious. Toppings were light but flavorful. The broth was tasty. The meat was tender. The noodles were amazing. I officially love soba thanks to soba-ya and will now begin to try all other popular soba places! I will be back to review soba-ya after my soba quest.
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}3}8/31/2012}Pretty good, although nothing spectacular.  Everything is overpriced.  I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon.  The broth was decent although I was glad it came with an egg which thickened up the broth and made it a little bit more hearty.  The bamboo that came in the bowl was a huge flavorless chunk that made me feel a little nauseous when I tried to eat it.  The udon also came with some really skinny long mushrooms.  The tips of the mushrooms were good on the initial bite, but the cook neglected to cut off the root/base. I thought the whole thing would be edible, but it was so chewy it made me want to gag a little.  Maybe if I'd had a steak knife I could have cut the roots off myself, but after that rubbery experience I had no desire. Everything else was okay.  Next time I'll tell them to put the tempura on the side.  The cook took some extra liberties as far as I was concerned and put my shrimp tempura directly into the udon in the kitchen.  When it came out, it was already a soggy mess.  Service was prompt.   The bathroom was clean, another plus.  I think I'll investigate some of the other restaurants on 9th street before I come back.
Grace H.}Jericho, NY}30}22}11}-1}3}8/30/2012}First off, the outdoor sign is really cool and has an authentic feel. Inside, it's cozy but kinda tight spaced and the waiters are in Japanese kimono type clothing. My friend and I had to sit at the counter because there were no seats available but our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. I got the Nabayake udon which was about $18. I paid $26 including tip and tax. There were some chicken, tempura shrimp (it was really good! just the right amount of crisp yet the bite of the shrimp was yummy, meaty, and warm), tempura carrot, mushroom, other vegetables. I attest to other reviewers who say that the ingredients are fresh. I just think it's a little over-priced. I didn't care so much for the broth. Not my cup of tea. My friend got some soba thing. Hers was decent. It's not tasteless as some reviewers say. Overall, a good experience, but won't be running back here anytime soon.
Gene W.}Manhattan, NY}30}44}10}-1}2}8/28/2012}Soba-ya would have gotten a solid 3 stars from me for their food, but, I'm sorry, I have reasonable expectations of customer service, and Soba-ya failed to meet them.I came in with three others, and two of us happened to still have a coffee drink in our hands, and the hostess told us we couldn't bring them in. Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that they served coffee....Wait, they don't.So I asked why, and she responded, "...because we sell drinks here and we want you to buy our drinks..."*MINDBLOWN*Okay, I get that restaurants totally have the right to establish their own no-outside food and drink policies. I'll even give the hostess some credit for her honesty. But really? It was a late morning for us. We were tired. We had out of town guests - so we got them coffee from one of the best cafes in Manhattan (this was no $1 coffee, alritey?) - and we came here to eat. I didn't need someone telling me that we couldn't have the rest of our coffee at their establishment, because - that's right - they wanted more of our money.Ultimately, it made us uncomfortable, and that discomfort is what's going to stick with me for awhile, and not their Oyakodon. Pity!
Jane L.}New York, NY}21}148}30}-1}3}8/28/2012}Got the cold tuna soba with grated yam. Interesting flavor but not my cup of tea. Didn't particularly like the slimy texture of the yam. The uni appetizer was better off without the yam. Icecream was okay. The wasabi honey was spicy. Never a big fan of wasabi so I can't really rate it. The green tea was divine though. It was by far the greenest, most bitter green tea icecream I've ever had. It was the best part of the meal :)
Lily T.}New York, NY}686}911}719}18}3}8/22/2012}guess I am just not a big fan of soba...it just taste like whole wheat noddles drenched in a soy sauce soup. I got the shrimp tempura soba. The shrimp was fried nice and crispy but there was nothing really special with the soba or the soup..Their assorted sashimi was very good tho..the fish was so fresh and just melts in your mouthservice was goodoverall, the quality of the food was good..but just don't like soba that much. Won't mind coming back to try other stuffs
Christine Y.}New York, NY}96}123}264}18}3}8/19/2012}Sobaya is kind of famous as there are less soba houses than ramen houses in St Marks.  So I was excited to finally come here with friends.The entrance was attractive, and the inside is cozy Japanese style with bamboos and woods.  Nice environment.The highlights are:1) pork belly appetizer in soup - the soup had a very unique taste.  They probably added some herbal in it.  Very delicious.  I couldn't stop drinking the soup.2) salmon carpaccio - tasted good, though the portion was too small for the price.3) cod - texture was very smooth, and the edge was seared to be crispy.  Loved it!4) cold soba noodle with shrimp tempura - the sauce (on the side) was a great a companion to the cold noodle.  Cold noodle was better than the hot soba noodle.The other dishes were just so-so.  The Chawan Mushi was sooooo ordinary that my mom could make it better at home.  The tempura was just alright - the batter was thicker and oilier than I would like.  Hot soba noodle was soggy.Overall, it's not as impressive as I thought.  Food was good, though not overwhelmingly good.  I expected it to be better.
Brian L.}Edison, NJ}152}255}1786}18}3}8/15/2012}The hot towel service before dinner is a cordial touch, the ambience is serene, and the service is commendable.I went with the intent of trying cold soba served by an establishment supposedly specializing in soba (hence, the restaurant name). The soba and broth were light and refreshing, but don't expect a bargain for an empty stomach. The largest portion of cold soba was $12 for about 1.5 instant-ramen-cups of noodles. If you have a small appetite and don't mind overpaying, give this place a try. Otherwise, plan to leave starving and/or broke.
Katie B.}New York, NY}74}135}525}-1}3}8/14/2012}A friend and I came here on a Sunday night for dinner and had a good experience though I would say the restaurant is over priced (depending on your standards of course...)  I had a regular sized duck soba which was tasty but the quality of the duck wasn't great and the portions were on the small side.  The noodles were broken up and soft, which I'm not a fan of.  My friend had Chirashi which he seemed to enjoy but the sashimi was chopped into small cubes, not sliced.  The atmosphere is nice but nothing worth raving about.  Service was good but nothing special.  A solid 3-star restaurant, but if you're in NYC, I would definitely recommend other places.
Jason T.}San Francisco, CA}239}354}46}-1}2}8/14/2012}tl;dr strange-tasting Japanese cuisine; small quantitiesIf you're thinking about taking your family or group of friends out for a nice hearty meal, this isn't the place. If you're looking for great bowls of soba or udon noodles or tasty dishes that work for every palette, this isn't the place. I should have heeded the warning about tiny portions... oh why oh why didn't I? This isn't your typical Japanese restaurant. To get the most out of this place you should have a great taste for Japanese food.My party of five came here after getting slapped with a 2.5 hour wait at Ippudo. We waited about 10 minutes before getting seated in one of the booths. Many of the patrons came in couples, and it felt a bit awkward coming in with my family of five and squeezing into a booth. We ordered the Curry Seido with cold soba noodles, Toro Toro with udon, and Vegetable Tempura rice bowl, all with the largest servings, hoping it would serve the five of us. The curry seido came first, and we were completely shocked with what we saw. Two small layers of soba noodles stacked on top of each other and a small bowl of curry. So this was what the "200g" meant. Disappointment was an understatement. The noodles were bland and didn't contribute much to the curry, which I admit was not bad.Next was the Vegetable Tempura rice bowl, and thankfully the outlook appeared positive. There were quite a few pieces of vegetables on a decent sized bowl of rice. Rice bowls don't come with a large size. Instead, the "set" comes with a few slices of pickles and a bowl of soup. Not worth it. However, nothing in this dish reached my taste expectations. The rice and sides were mediocre and the tempura was just plain tempura. Lastly, we have the Toro Toro udon. I'm sorry, but what did I just eat? It was presented like a bi bim bap with various cold ingredients above cold noodles. I try to forget this dish because it tasted so strange and different from the Japanese food I have tasted before, but it had soggy mushrooms and a clump of wet seaweed. Even if you're used to Japanese food, I would suggest that you avoid this dish.Overall, the atmosphere was decent, but this place clearly appealed to couples. But I did not like the food at all, and I recommend you avoid this place if you don't have a lot of Japanese cuisine experience.
Derrick C.}Princeton, NJ}30}24}4}-1}5}8/13/2012}After trying many of the other popular soba places (cocoron, totto, koh etc.), sobaya remains my favorite for a plain cold soba with dipping sauce.I have tried some of the fancier sobas at sobaya as well (such as the uni soba with jap yam) but I thought the plain cold soba with nothing except nori, scallions and wasabi was significantly better than all the other places. The noodles are perfectly cooked and the cold dipping sauce is delicious. I've been to sobaya many times and they've always had consistently good noodles and dip.
Nelly N.}Manhattan, NY}7}189}67}-1}2}8/12/2012}Came here once, I think I need to try it again.  Not really sure why all the hype, I think I got the wrong thing.  The noodles was just ok.  Not sure if it's suppose to be better?  Damn, maybe I got a bad batch.  Nah, no way!  I am going to get everything and eat it until I give this place 4 or 5 stars like everyone else.
Dennis J.}New York, NY}13}743}33}18}4}8/11/2012}Two friends and I stopped in for dinner on a weekend, and we were told there would be a half hour wait but that they would call us when there was a spot. We were sitting in Cha-An across the street for 15 minutes before we received a call telling us we could be seated, so definitely be prepared to be called on the earlier side if asked to wait.The atmosphere is nice, and the booth in which we were seated was comfortable. We ordered a carafe of sake (two glasses each for three people), along with an uni dish, the tuna tartar, and the tofu to start. They were all pretty good; the tofu is creamier than most, and I've had tastier tuna tartar. The soba was quite good; I ordered the cold soba with dipping sauce, while my friends had the duck soba. Their opinion was that the duck itself was not as great, although they enjoyed the broth.For dessert, we ordered a scoop of each of the honey wasabi, green tea, and black sesame ice cream, along with the green tea creme brulee. Unfortunately, if I could do it again, I would only have the black sesame ice cream of all of these; the green tea ice cream could have been sweeter, I felt, and the green tea creme brulee was a bit too pudding-like and not that tasty. All in all, though, it was a nice meal (a bit on the pricey side) with fairly good service and a nice environment.
Michael L.}Waldwick, NJ}48}362}152}18}3}8/8/2012}For the best soba on the East Coast, this is the best place to be.You all might wonder why I gave 3-stars instead of 4 or more based on my accolade on top.  Well, that is because the service and quantity fall far behind.  Let me talk about the good parts first.My favorite dish here is the Cold Uni Soba for $20.  It is ambrosia to my mouth.  The rich buttery sea urchin roe flavors the whole experience making every swallow comforting and soothing. The cold refreshing broth, at the same time,  giving you a sense of consuming a cleansing, almost healing draft.The desserts are also a pure delight.The quality of food is first rate, but the portion size is for the dieter or those well practiced on fasting.   Each bowl of soba can be consumed with three of four bites, and you must depend on the broth to fill you the rest of the way... which is about 2 metric cups worth of liquid.  I often need to order two bowls to stop my hunger pangs, which can get pricey.Now the service through the most part seems fine till you need your check taken care of, or if you want to sit down and talk to your dining partner while ordering more.  Took 40 minutes for them to get the check to me once.  Another time a server came to us and ask us to leave so others could be seated... we were going to order seconds and dessert.
Martin L.}Brooklyn, NY}29}147}1}-1}4}7/31/2012}whenever i have a craving for soba, inevitably soba-ya creeps into my mind. i'm not going to say this place isn't pricey though, for a regular cold soba with classic dipping sauce, it will run you about $11 and almost all the other cold soba or hot soba combos are $15-18. But i guess this doesn't appear to affect their business (and doesn't affect me going there either) even with various competitions near by. it's a pretty classic japanese place, where they focus more on the flavors and less on the presentation. it's pretty much constantly full. i've never been there at an eating hour or late eating hours without a line somehow waiting, although the hostess do a pretty poor job of estimating times. On one instance they told me an hr wait and within 10 min i was called, and most recently the past weekend, we were told 30 mins while  they were already calling us after 5. Needless to say in that respect, expect fast service and quick tables turnaround.the noodles are made fresh and have a "bouncy" texture, which i personally prefer more compared to soba-koh (which is only down a few blocks). they are also more yellow than you would typically expect for soba (with my experience it being more brownish). Try the duck soba (either cold or hot, both very good), which is melty and flavorful from being soaked in soba soy sauce broth. The appetizers are quite good as well. don't think i've ever been really dissappointed with them from the many that i've tried. this place is definitely worth a visit.
Chris C.}New York, NY}35}147}61}-1}4}7/29/2012}I'm not a huge soba fan but Soba-ya was so good. I had the tempura hot soba noodles. Delicious noodles and shrimp! The ice cream dessert was interesting. I liked the black bean flavor the best.
Mar C.}Manhattan, NY}66}152}10}-1}4}7/29/2012}Lunch special was delicious! I loved the soba noodles, shrimp tempura was cooked well, and the presentation was excellent.
Marielle S.}Manhattan, NY}70}71}9}-1}3}7/24/2012}Had an L size Kamo Seiro (duck meat served in a hot broth with cold soba noodles on the side). It was alright. The taste wasn't really memorable and I'm not sure if I was just particularly hungry that night or what, but I was still hungry after. I've had better but I might be a little spoiled from having lived in Japan. For $20 this dish didn't really seem worth it.I do like the variety on the menu and wouldn't be opposed to coming back and sampling other items. The Early Bird special seems like a good deal.
Curly S.}Brooklyn, NY}2}32}0}-1}4}7/23/2012}We go there every sunday. Ironically, we love the udon better than the soba
Sam F.}Brooklyn, NY}3}21}0}-1}4}7/20/2012}Solid, solid ramen. The dashi is incredible. Nabe(?) ramen or soba is the way to go.I've had mixed results ordering other dishes, but the seafood rice bowl is also really tasty. Definitely more expensive, but it's in Manhattan, so that figures. The ice creams are good if you're in the right mood -- sweet wasabi is a unique flavor. If this place were a bit cheaper and had more variety, I'd give it five stars. Be prepared to wait up to an hour for a table, but there are plenty of nearby bars to hang out in while you wait.
E W.}Brooklyn, NY}168}308}43}-1}3}7/16/2012}SO WE SAT AROUND FRIDAY NIGHT EATING CUM. It was pretty good though. Seriously, there is a cum appetizer - who woulda thought? It also comes with 'sea tongue' - whatever that is. I basically made this a dinner of sake though. Oh! And the best thing was.......... The green tea ice cream! Superlative!!!! BEYOND. BEYOND BEYOND. The richest, darkest green I've ever seen on an ice cream wet dream spin around ten times and say shucks wow this place is not so bad.
Shing Yiing O.}Manhattan, NY}380}622}603}-1}4}7/12/2012}3.5 stars?? Leaning towards 4.. I ode red a cold soba noodle.. just a small portion and the summer special appetizer.. with jelly fish (can't remember what's the name of it).. it looks like rice pudding.. but is jelly fish instead.. lol.. it looks like a dessert to me..The cold noodles was pretty good.. but not amazing.. I mix it with the dipping sauce they gave.. after my meal.. they gave me some hot water to mix with it so that I can drink it as a soup.. interesting.. I did not know about it..My friend ordered the curry hot noodle.. with soba.. I guess for hot noodles.. Udon definitely taste better.. the curry soup was so thick and I felt sick eating it with soba.. I don't know why.. My friend don't really like it..Service was pretty good.. At first I changed my order and they told me they can't do it.. but they will help.. but I don't think there is such thing that can't change my order since the chef have not cook my dish..
Julie A.}Manhattan, NY}38}183}4}-1}4}7/5/2012}Helpful service, assorted tempura, pork katsu don small lunch special, and cold sake over ice (on the house) made for an excellent summer lunch adventure. We sat at the bar, which ended up being a godsend as I am a soba newbie and had to ask a few (probably embarrassing) questions. With lots of servers hustling around, I was able to clarify what to do with the white stuff that comes with the tempura (mix it in with the dipping sauce), confirm that yes, the noodles are meant to be dipped into the accompanying broth, and figure out why exactly I was given a cube-shaped tea kettle with mysterious hot liquid (you're supposed to pour it into the leftover broth and drink it like soup). So, now you know.I was quite pleased with everything I ordered, starting with the totally excellent tempura plate. The small lunch special was decidedly not small, and I was happy to have the pork and rice bowl to accompany my cold soba. My co-adventurer just got a (large) plain soba, which was fine, but I think he may have been a bit jealous of my order. More learning!Anyway, a lovely place to get out of the heat and enjoy a relaxing lunch.
Melissa T.}San Francisco, CA}28}319}2}18}4}6/24/2012}My friend and I randomly came to eat on a Saturday around 6:30. The wait was fairly short and the service was great. I ordered the Kama Namban noodle just because it seemed different. $16 for a bowl of noodles is kind of crazy. I swear I liked it and finished off the entire thing but I said to my friend "I feel like I'm drinking hot dog juice" and after she tried some she agreed and took it to mean I didn't like it. No, it was good just ... hot dog juice-yWhile both of us were kind of meh about the soba noodles, the saving grace was the FREAKING AMAZING appetizer, tuna yabi-maki. So delicious, I know I am going to crave that forever and ever. It's tuna sashimi wrapped in beancurd atop guacamole which a three way combo I would have never dared to dream. Seriously, get it and relish it
Anthony T.}New York, NY}362}65}92}-1}4}6/22/2012}Their soba is always great, I am big fan of their cold soba.  Everyday, they have this daily bento box special, their is only 25 being serve daily and it is first come first serve.  Cold soba at Soba-ya is like the best summer noodle in the city. just be aware that during the day time, their are many family and kids.  Might not be the best quite lunch spot you seek.
Josh K.}Jackson Heights, NY}291}1298}39}18}4}6/20/2012}Get the lunch bento, if available, any old day of the week. They say they only sell 25 per day - I do believe they have slightly more because we came at 1:30pm on a Saturday and they still had some.This isn't your typical American-Japanese, chicken teriyaki with california rolls bento box. This is a real Japanese The amount of variety is just staggering. Your lunch box will probably be different, but I received a small portion of soba, tempura, a rice ball with ikura on top, stewed lotus root, a small hijiki salad, a portion of dried fish, three kinds of pickles... and dessert (a tofu custard with a strawberry flavor.)It's worth every penny of the $20 it costs. Remember, restaurants are best when they are presenting a variety that you cannot make yourself at home without investing a whole day's worth of effort. This bento box containing 8 or 9 or more (damn, lost count...) items is probably the best deal in town. And it's super authentic and super traditional to boot.Oh, and by the way, the soba itself is good. not the best I've ever had, but freshly made, and you get to drink the soba-yu afterward - I can't really ask for much more but I am not a super discerning soba eater as long as all of the key ingredients and presentations are there.
Elbee M.}Atlanta, GA}13}165}0}-1}5}6/18/2012}The soba was great.  Tons of options for all types of eaters (vegan through carnivore).  Also, their weekend special chirashi bowl was awesome.  I enjoyed it even more than the soba.
Laura A.}Jersey City, NJ}259}7}0}-1}5}6/10/2012}My friend and I came here for lunch about a week ago. We were seated right away. The ambience was really nice, and the cold soba was ridiculously good! I had the yamakake, and my friend had the kamo seiro. I finished my food in fifteen minutes LOLOLOL. I loved that they gave us a small cup of genmaicha at the end of our meal. Our waiter was also really lovely! LOL, the toilet is also nice. It's one of those TOTO toilets that washes your butt and warms the seat. Basically, there's really nothing bad to say about this place! I will definitely come back in the future. :3cc
Jason G.}Boca Raton, FL}321}449}149}-1}4}6/9/2012}I am not going to pretend like I know a lot of about this kind of food, I don't. What I do know is after trying a slew of noodle bars, Soba-Ya takes the crown.So fresh and so clean word to Andre Benjamin. That is this place in a nutshell. Prices are right and the menu is pretty overwhelming for people unfamiliar with the whole noodle phenomenon but keep ti simple. Nabeyaki Udon with with shrimp tempura is a home run every time.If you're in the lower East and want a cool atmosphere, Soba-Ya is the right call.
Daphne L.}New York, NY}1}4}68}-1}4}6/6/2012}Lovely Service and atmosphere. I had the kamo seiro - duck cold soba noodles with hot dipping broth. The flavor of the broth was so rich with dashi smokiness. I found the dish to be very homey. Next time I'd like to try the Nabeyaki Udon.
Markus J.}Portola Valley, CA}6}186}0}-1}4}6/4/2012}Great soba and udon. Appetizers and rice bowls good, too. Service is friendly and fast, but there is often a line to get seated.
Sue P.}Brooklyn, NY}39}111}4}-1}3}6/4/2012}i consider $25 for a lunchbox rather overpriced, but you do get a lot of food. everything tastes fine. the tempura shrimp is especially good, light, crunchy. the wasabi honey ice cream really is as delicious as everyone says. but the soba is NOT very good, especially considering it's their namesake. the soba is a muddy, gummy, hot mess. the dipping sauce and condiments are fine.
Jen K.}Queens, NY}237}344}3}18}5}5/27/2012}Super-good food!!!  I've tried many of their ever-changing specials, and they are all great.  TIP:  GET THE WASABI HONEY ICE CREAM!!!!!I finally took the advice of some other Yelp reviewers and ordered this ice cream, and it was the highlight of my last meal.  It's so good I seriously think about that ice cream all the time now - it's effing AMAZING.  I also tried the green tea brûlée, which is a little mediocre.  The top is nice but the cream part is too full of green tea powder for me.BUT GET THE WASABI ICE CREAM!!  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  YOU WILL BE SMILING LIKE THIS:    :D  :)  :p
Ruth C.}Mountain View, CA}480}481}246}18}4}5/26/2012}Nice fresh soba, but not on par with Japan.I came here to eat on my own (I don't mind eating on my own and quite enjoy taking my own time for my own meals).  I like their different set options that guarantee you get a TON of food for a decent price.  It's not cheapcheap, but it's not pricey.  You can get a good meal for $15-20.  Definitely the best deal I've found for a scrumptious meal.I opted for a plain cold soba with ten-don set.  The soba was pretty good and fresh (they have a guy making soba near the entrance in a show-y area... a little too gimmick-y for me), and the ten-don had good flavor and was quite generous.  A bit too much rice and not enough sauce, but that's ok.Lot of Japanese patrons and overall a very clean place.  The restaurant is somewhat small but they cram a lot of tables in... service wasn't great, but it was relatively busy during a weekday lunch.I'd come back, but it's not my favorite place.  Maybe if I was dining with other people it would have been different.  I think this place necessitates eating with others... but dining alone just seemed too lonely this time which was weird.
Lisako V.}Hoboken, NJ}0}105}1}-1}4}5/17/2012}Good vibes here. Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere. I enjoyed the nasu in dashi- very light and flavorful. The soba itself was very good, along with the veggies, though the broth didn't make much of an impression on me. I'll definitely come back and try some other dishes... maybe zaru soba instead.
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}3}5/16/2012}it is decent and clean, but nothing amazing. good but nothing to write home about. i've tried multiple dishes, but my conclusion: cocoron is much better than soba-ya
Osman J.}Manhattan, NY}152}256}600}-1}5}5/2/2012Updatedreview}5 star for Buta Kakuni, maybe 3.5 to 4 for everything else.It is really amazing, you can just order it with a rice and beer and will make your night.
Alex W.}New York, NY}6}130}0}-1}3}4/28/2012}I probably should have gotten a soba dish because of the restaurant's name, but I'm a much bigger fan of udon, so I opted for the duck udon, which was actually quite tasty. The udon was cooked to a perfect al dente with just the right amount of chewiness, and the broth was tasty. The duck was a bit tough, which was to be expected as it sat in the soup. It's a bit pricey for a bowl of udon, but I guess if you wanted to splurge...?
Amy M.}Manhattan, NY}51}303}615}-1}4}4/26/2012}I came here about two weeks ago on a Friday after work to Soba-ya. It was around 6PM and I was able to get a seat right away, which was good. I just sat at the bar. There was a waitress/bartender behind the counter and she was so sweet and such great service!I ordered beer, Kirin Ichiban. It was good and light. :)For appetizer, I ordered the tempura that came with shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura. I felt that was so fresh and so much better than what I have had at other Asian restaurants. Maybe this place is more authentic. Who knows?As for the entree, I had the soba with duck and hot soup. That was really good. Nice and hot and it was a perfect day for it.And for dessert, I had the black sesame ice cream. So good!This place was great from beginning to end! It is an authentic Japanese restaurant and I appreciate that a lot in NYC. And yes, everyone raves about the toilet in the bathroom. It's the same one as the ones they have in Japan and the hotel rooms. Basically, it cleans your butt when you press a button! LOL! :P
Jade J.}Brooklyn, NY}360}171}786}-1}5}4/25/2012}Had this twice in the past 3 weeks. Always get the lunch special tempura soba bento! Really way too much food for one person but soo good (and I'm greedy). You can definitely tell that the soba is fresh with a slight chew. I even got to see one of the chefs knead and cut the noodles in the station next to the hostess table. Service is impeccable and prompt. Love this place!
R P.}Brooklyn, NY}27}1}0}-1}5}4/23/2012}On the JZ to Fulton I tripped on a weird tin and it was ACTUALLY a sardine tin and a few feet away was a weird puddle. I switched cars and ended up at Fulton to discover that there was no C train, shuttle, substitute, substitute teacher, adequate prostitute or adequate constitution to get me to Bed Stuy tonight. I just marveled at this italian MTA crew talking about something called a 'gang box by the hatch' and the signage which suggested alternative trains in Manhattan running on nearby lines and then suggesting anywho on the C line in Brooklyn to 'just take the 2345 instead' and live a mile or two to the left. Finally on the Queensbound JZ give-up platform to get back to the Marcy stop and just call it a night at home, this weird smelling train pulled in. I hopped over the tin, thinking, 'wow, three sardine encounters in one evening!' (--Earlier at Soba Ya).Tin can chat aside, I have discovered a superlative soba joint.
Tompy F.}Manhattan, NY}2}121}1}-1}3}4/16/2012}The lunch boxes (only 25 per day, supposingly) are plentiful but nothing that special. Recently got a B rating. One wonders.
Alice A.}Sacramento, CA}211}358}1966}18}5}4/14/2012}Had  the hot Duck Soba special and it was fantastic! The noodles were fresh and tasty, the soup was rich and hearty, and the duck and mushrooms were delicious.  For dessert, had Green Tea Creme Brulee and gee there was a lot more than I thought but it was definitely good; crisp sugar top and creamy green tea goodness below.Will definitely return here to try their other entrees :)
S S.}Brooklyn, NY}27}288}912}-1}3}4/6/2012}It's a good Japanese restaurant to eat soba noodles. Good environment and many soba noodles options (cold and hot), drinks and appetites. The appetites are good. I like the Tuna Yuba Maki with avocado. The soba salad was okay but the taste was too plain for me. Next time, I will order the Soba noodle soup.
Meredith X.}Chicago, IL}320}195}25}-1}4}4/3/2012}Ate here for lunch in anticipation of watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi (fine, didn't eat sushi but thought I'd stick with the Japanese theme). Light, delectable, satisfying. Ordered the sesame tofu to start. A little block of tofu came out surrounded by a pool of sauce (miso based?). Took the little spoon that came along with the dish and dug in. Surprisingly very thick, custard and cheese like. The normally flavorless tofu had a sweet flavor to it. Very delicious and unexpected. Ordered the Friday special of toro toro soba. Noodles cooked perfected, firm and not gummy. Loved the little mushrooms and grated yam. Dipping sauce was very flavorful. My server was also very informative as to how I should be eating the soba properly (I think she saw me struggling, mixing haphazardly, and slurping away, too refined). Left content but not overly satiated. Great place to go for a quick lunch.
Sam C.}San Francisco, CA}0}33}0}-1}3}3/24/2012}This is one of those popular spots around St. Marks. Personally I found the food to be overpriced for what it is. But the atmosphere is pretty nice, and perhaps it would be a good place to go to on a date. Personally I think it's a bit too small and pricy.
Celia Y.}Astoria, Queens, NY}649}335}530}-1}5}3/23/2012}Okay so I see a lot of reviews that critique the 'light' flavor of the food here. Well this is exactly what soba/udon and the dipping sauce is supposed to taste like! It is supposed to be light in flavor! This place is the most authentic Japanese noodle place I've been to yet. And I know because I've studied abroad in Tokyo, Japan and had some kind of noodles almost everyday. I ordered the Maguro(tuna sashimi with rice) don lunch set with cold udon noodles. The udon and maguro were delicious and fresh, the broth was solid, especially in the end when you pour boiling water into the broth to drink it up like soup. The small pickled items were really good, though I've had better in Japan. But the overall meal was delicious and the flavors all tasted nostalgic to me. If you are looking for an authentic Japanese meal and you love either soba or udon noodles, this is definitely the place to go!
Homer S.}Hoboken, NJ}15}283}9}-1}3}3/10/2012}I thought our lunch was satisfying and well-rounded. I liked the duck in my soba noddles and it was filling overall.  My dining companion thought it was a well balanced. Truthfully, while it was enjoyable, I crave ramen. I don't crave soya sauce based broths with relatively boring noodles (yes, that's you udon and you soba).
Thomas M.}Flushing, NY}357}197}39}-1}3}3/4/2012}I only had the hot soba there, and I wasn't impressed.I'll re-review when I try the cold soba and the wasabi ice cream
Cheryl W.}Borough Park, Brooklyn, NY}10}10}62}-1}5}3/2/2012}The design inside the store is exquisite and has a japan feel to it. The employee's are really nice and kind. They are extremely polite and patient. The soba tasted damn good. The sweets are also pretty good especially the sesame ice cream. The price is worth it for the food. This is recommended for friend's gathering and hangout.
Michael T.}Fairfield, CT}3}49}0}-1}3}2/23/2012}Sobya is a competent soba noodle restaurant - most dishes are reasonably priced, and quite flavorful.This eatery is definitely worth a visit, although it can hardly be described as outstanding - still, it is enjoyable.Please take a look at the Sobaya pictures here:flickr.com/photos/nickna…
Chris K.}Washington, DC}46}379}65}-1}3}2/21/2012}I got the bento lunch set, which came with an assortment of different items. The food was all standard. I opted for the cold soba, which came with tempura shrimp and chile. The one thing I really liked was that at the very end, the waitress put boiling water into the soba sauce, to make it a soup. The dessert was meh. The food was okay for its $17 price tag, but I felt as if it was all one-note. In actuality, I'd much prefer the robust, dericious flavors of Korean food! This meal was kinda bland :/
Trevor P.}Manhattan, NY}77}152}7}-1}4}2/11/2012}I've tried to come here before on weekends and didn't feel like waiting in line, so I recently went on a weekday night and was seated immediately.I had a duck/mushroom soba and my date had the tempura veggies over rice. Both of us were super impressed at the freshness of all the ingredients. My broth was smokey and meaty, the noodles were nice and firm, and it was just the right size. Hers was exceptional- the accompanying sauce was sweet and tangy, perfect with the veggies and rice. We're both craving it since we ate there. And if you go, DON'T skimp on dessert! The honey wasabi ice cream is an experience and a treat. It's complex, spicy, sweet, creamy. A perfect end to your meal. But share a scoop with the table, since finishing it on your own would be a serious wasabi overdose.
Susan L.}Manhattan, NY}313}420}670}18}4}2/2/2012}This is definitely the place to go to when you want yummy soba. Besides the soba, the appetizers are delicious too. The bento box was really good, however the salmon was a bit overcooked. They also give you a little dessert after you're done with the meal.
Ian K.}Los Angeles, CA}8}37}0}-1}1}2/2/2012}This will go down as one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. My entree was described as having grated yams atop the seared tuna and rice bowl. instead it came with a viscous cream of wheat like pudding atop the rice. It was one of the most vile substances I have ever tasted and the only food I'ver ever eaten that actually triggered my gag reflex. We immediately called the waitress over to let her know that these yams were not grated as the menu described, and were not edible by even the most liberal definitions of the word. She replied by saying that the restaurants policy is not to take back any items. We insisted that the entree was not as it was described on the menu, at which point we commenced the portion of our dinner wherein we engaged in a spirited debate about the precise definition of "grated." Now, this server was nice enough and a competent waitress, but no one would confuse her for a native english speaker. She, and the manager who arrived to investigate the fracas, insisted that these yams were grated.  It quickly became clear that they were going to stand by this poor translation.  At that point I said, "whether or not these yams are grated , this is inedible. We'd like to get something else instead." The manager too insisted that they could not take it back. After a bit more scuffling, we ended up ordering something else, saying "We are not going to eat this grated yam rice bowl, so you can take it back to the kitchen. In a New York City restaurant, it would be absurd to charge us for something that was misdescribed on the menu and effectively inedible." The manager didn't respond. When we got our bill, we were shocked to see that we had been charged ($16.50) for the misdescribed, uneaten, and inedible entree. Truly, some of the worst service I've ever received anywhere.
William W.}Brooklyn, NY}0}6}0}-1}4}2/1/2012}I came here with my girlfriend twice for their dinner service. Both times, coincidentally we sat in the exact same spot, haha. Anyway, this place is in St. Marks, so for dinner time it's always buzzing. It's a good place, the food is tasty, but I have to say that the portions are small if you order off the menu. It's better to get the Dinner Special because you get way more food for the price that you're paying for. You have your choice of Udon or Soba, and the Soba is very light tasting, not like the ones you cook by yourself from the packages (it's made in house here). The tsuyu sauce is pretty tasty, though I have a suspicion it's from a bottle. The last time I came, I wasn't really that hungry, so I just ordered regular Zaru Soba. For those of you who don't know, Zaru Soba is straight up cold soba noodles on a plate, with dipping sauce. That already set me back 12.00 USD, haha... damn. My girlfriend ordered a Kitsune Udon Soup. She said the soup flavor was oddly off for a Japanese run restaurant, but what do I know, I'm not Japanese and I thought it tasted pretty damn good, haha.Overall, good experience. Food is a little pricey for what you get (I was nowhere near full with my entree) but the quality is good, and the atmosphere isn't too bad. More like 3.5 stars, to be honest.
N H.}New York, NY}5}42}14}-1}2}1/31/2012}As a lover of soba noodles and japanese cuisine, I am sorry to report that I did not have a good dining experience here. I really wanted to like the food at Soba-Ya, it had such a wonderful reputation and I had expectations of enjoying delicious soba- but it was not to be. My husband and I ordered the ika meshi, tuna tartar, hot soba with tempura and the cold soba with a shirasu & mitsuba leaf tempura fried cake (the exact name of the dish escapes me).Appetizer breakdown: The ika meshi (sticky rice stuffed squid) had an unpleasant, artificial smoke flavor- my husband couldn't choke down more than one piece, I didn't think it was quite that bad (it was edible) but I'd never order it again. The tuna tartar was mediocre: while the freshness was fine, the tartar mix wasn't particularly flavorful and the large chunks of mountain yam inside didn't compliment the flavor of the tuna but added an awkward texture that made for unpleasant eating.Entree breakdown: My husband enjoyed the tempura, but didn't like the broth that came with his soba. My husband is very picky, but I tasted it and was in full agreement. I was taken back with how terrible it was. The flavor was that of a cheap soy sauce mixed in with instant dashi from a packet, with an indescribable chemical afternote. The dipping sauce for my cold soba tasted like a cold version of the same broth. I was pleased with the shirasu (baby sardine) and mitsuba tempura, this was delicious and crisp, I just wish the broths that came with our soba was palatable. We were considering complaining but felt it wasn't worth the trouble if the rest of the food was so lackluster we'd never return to dine again.The soba was the greatest source of disappointment in my experience. If this is what "GOOD" soba is supposed to taste like, than I don't think I'm such a big fan of soba after all.  It was not terrible, just bland like paste. To be honest, the dried soba noodles in my pantry have a more complex, earthy flavor than Soya-Ya's fresh soba. On a bright note, the service was very good even on a busy night. It was entirely the food that let us down. I sincerely hope that we attended this restaurant on an off night, but the food was so inconsistent and lackluster that we will not be coming back. There are better places to dine in the East Village.
Miinno N.}New York, NY}0}334}0}-1}4}1/29/2012Updatedreview}I went with my two children on Sunday for lunch.  I LOVED the food and so did my kids.We could have given 5STARS with the food, but we had a bad experience initially and I have to give 3.5 - 4 STAR now because of it.It was a little after 1:30 when we arrived and many people were waiting.  Even though we initially had no space to wait, the kids behaved well.  Later we got to sit at the bench to wait.  Many people came and got seated.  Then, I realized that we had been skipped.  First I thought it was because we were three of us and they had seats for 2 available.  However, I witnessed that they were giving seats to others - party of 4 and 3 who came after us!  When the seating lady was giving another table to a newly arrived (probably had been there for 5 minutes VS us waiting over 30 minutes), I said to her, " you know we have been here waiting for very long."  She said, "because you have a baby" - ???? was my first reaction.   A baby?  My son is almost 4 and he was patiently waiting and behaving.... my daughter is much older - well-behaved as well....It seemed that they have special seats that they preferred customers with children to sit.  Maybe they should have mentioned it to me when they were seating others but not enough words - for Japanese restaurant, even in the US, they need to educate their staff to have the kind of service you would expect in Japan.In Japan or from a Japanese staff, I would have certainly gotten a word from the staff asking us to be patient because they would prefer to corner seats and back seats to the customers with children as it would be easier for them to manage.For a second, I got rather offended when the woman called my son a baby and so was he - he almost cried!!Also, I was annoyed - because this woman asked everyone who came into check in her/ his coats and luggage but me.  I had three coats and a bag full of hats/ scarf and various things in a big bag!  I was worried about my experience of Soba-ya  would be terrible today and it made me sad as I came to celebrate my daughter's achievement.However, we got seated after few minutes to the seat which I did not was allowing kids (corner seat, but not at the back).Once I got seated, we ordered quickly.Dashi Tamago (omlet) from Appetizer menumini sake oyako don (the salmon sashimi with salmon roe on the bed of rice)Kamo seiro (cold soba noodle with duck and scallion dipping sauce)Ten zaru (cold soba noodle with dipping sauce and tempura)Since our appetizer was to take sometime, a Japanese staff came and gave us edamame on the house.  Also, he was very careful in our drink order and also giving us various plates for various things.  It was really nice.My daughter LOVED her Kamo seiro.  Both kids LOVED Tamago (and so did I).  The dipping sauce for the Tamago was slightly different from soy sauce and it was nice.My Tempura was great - light and exquisite as good Tempura should be.The noodle was just right.The sake oyako don was excellent and my son and I really enjoyed it.So in the end, the food experience was great.I just hope that next time, they will educate the seating staff so that they do not offend customer like us....
Amy R.}Brooklyn, NY}158}73}12}-1}4}1/22/2012}Great prices for filling delicious soba noodles!Entree: I had both the kamo namban and the curry noodles here. The curry noodles was far better than the kamo in terms of taste. The kamo broth was just a bit plain for my taste. The slightly spicy curry broth made the dish a real treat! Soba was just perfect :)Dessert: I tried my friend's ice cream and it is strong and true to the original's flavor. I personally enjoyed the anmitsu and I don't even like tongyuan! But the sweet sauce makes the boring tongyuan pretty enjoyable. Can't wait to try their other desserts!
M D.}New York, NY}4}113}271}-1}5}1/18/2012}This has been a favorite for YEARS. I can always count on them for excellent service and tasty soba noodles, cold or hot! My favorite is their Kamo Seiro (duck) soba because I love dipping cold noodles in the flavorful hot broth. Then, it's like you get another meal because they bring you noodle broth to add to the concentrated dipping broth to made a soup! I'm also a fan of their Yasai Soba soup and Agedashi Tofu appetizer. And I always get their Japanese yam appetizer: Satsuma Imo. It's soooo incredibly sweet and tasty! The place itself is super authentic, and they will yell a welcome to you as you're seated. The decor is beautiful and the place, while it can be noisy, is still calming for me. The bathroom is very cool too, with a Japanese toilet that is a sure conversation piece for those unfamiliar with it. :) I have rarely had a long wait for this place except at expected busy prime dinner hour. But if you get there earlier, you don't have much of a wait, if at all. A solid place for soba!
Lily P.}San Francisco, CA}1248}987}3255}18}4}1/11/2012}Noodles are clean (not over cooked, not undercooked, made in house, fresh, didn't need extra ingredients), yummy, the veggies are fresh, and the place is just simple good food. Unlike ramen where it gets dirty inside of ramen, overwhelming smell of buttered noodles with tons of oil and extra toppings..thie place was more relaxing with good service and straight forward menu with the sizes done by grams.
Cathy S.}Apex, NC}20}135}310}-1}4}1/10/2012}Good noodles. Quick, warm and spot-on service. Only complaint is that they always keep a server overlooking the dining area adjacent to the entrance...given that it is a small and quiet space it makes me feel being watched,especially if you are dining alone. Ask to be seated at the bar or in the corner you will be fine.
Elizabeth J.}San Francisco, CA}589}635}749}18}4}1/6/2012}Came here a few days ago for some Pho! Very tasty. Fast service, nice pieces of meat. Definitely a good spot for some soup.  Also had the shrimp spring rolls -very tasty.  Will def come back or order delivery.  Love Phooooooooooooo Very cheap too.
Matt L.}Manhattan, NY}90}138}225}-1}2}1/6/2012}Sobaya has been so highly regarded by many and I had great expectations for this place only to find that I was highly disappointed. Compared to Soba Totto, this place is not even close to being in the same league. After waiting so long through an endless line, I was shocked to learn that the food is mediocre and that this place has been overhyped by the media. I came to this place twice to give it fair judgement and I am writing to let you know that Soba-ya is "NOT WORTH WAITING IN LINE FOR." Go to Soba Totto, you can cut the line and have a much better soba. As a matter of fact, Soba Totto has better portions, better quality soba than Soba-ya for the same or less price. For example, I tried the Uni Soba at both places. I found out that Soba Totto has more Uni in their soba than Soba-ya and it is much better quality. And the price? Same. Soba Totto beats Soba-ya both in quantity and quality. I have given tries to their appetizers and other dishes. But, the results are the same. I have no bias on any restaurants, and am writing to distinguish the difference between overhype and what is really good. Soba-ya is an overhype.
Caitlin R.}Brooklyn, NY}14}58}3}-1}4}1/5/2012}I have to admit, I always come here for their yakinabe udon. Their soba is okay but I prefer SobaKoh. Yakinabe udon is the best thing especially in a cold winter night. The broth, the egg, the tempura shrimp, the right kind of chicken, you will have to try really hard to slow down or you're going to burn your mouth while chowing down these yumminess. One thing to complain, why is there broccoli and carrot in the mixed tempura? That just feels so wrong!!
Lucia T.}Manhattan, NY}151}57}150}-1}5}1/4/2012}LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Legit Japanese food. Bonito fish broth is to die for cus it's some smokey yumminess!
Pierre S.}Manhattan, NY}28}124}5}-1}5}12/30/2011}Curry udon was excellent. Salmon don very good. But the best was the crazy honey wasabi ice cream. Edgy and so yummy. Great service.
Kevin S.}Newton, MA}76}15}0}-1}4}12/29/2011}Deservedly on the list of Michelin recommended restaurants under 40. Hand made soba noodles were delicious; green tea was perfect for a cold NYC winter night; honey wasabi ice cream was unique (though is certainly an acquired taste). Service was polite despite the wait. Highly recommended.
Liz M.}Boston, MA}144}249}7}-1}3}12/28/2011}NOT worth waiting on line for.  And thankfully I did not. If you are dying to try it.. go on a Tuesday at like.... 5:45 or 6pm?$18 dinner special is legit.  The sweet potato is eh.  The other appetizers are decent.... a taste.. The soba is good but its not SPECTACULAR that I would wait many minutes for.  It's a gamble.  server was rather awkward, she wanted to chide me for my resusable coffee mug. it ended up in a very awkward 2 minute silent spat. Dessert for the dinner special? canned strawberry on top of vanilla ice cream? you can do better than that, east village japanese restaurant.  even the japanese restaurants in flushing give green tea :)
Alan L.}Manhattan, NY}26}84}36}-1}4}12/24/2011}Came here last night alone. First, I have to say that I love the way the restaurant looks--just very clean, well-lit, and welcoming. And I had a seat at the bar and didn't feel uncomfortable eating by myself at all.At the recommendation of the waitress behind the bar, I got the duck and green onion hot soba. I thought it was a pretty generous serving and it definitely filled me up for the rest of the night. The slices of duck had a strip of fat along each piece which I thought was a little un-eatable. I ended up just tearing it off and putting in a small dish. The one thing about the dish was that there was just something a little off with the broth, like it was missing a 2% somewhere. It was a little sour (so maybe a little too much vinegar or not enough... something else?)They give you a cup of barley tea after your meal, which is a really nice touch.I ordered the honey wasabi ice cream for dessert. That was an interesting taste. I actually liked it, but of course, if you don't like the wasabi taste--don't order it! (There's little dots of wasabi in the ice cream). It's not as firey as what you might get when you just put wasabi on sushi but you definitely feel it in your nostrils. It was one of those tastes, where the more you eat, the more you can eat.The service at Soba-ya was amazing. Loved it. My glass was never half past empty and the bar waitress has probably been one of the nicest servers I've had in a long time. I would say the food (and the price--I ended up paying $25 for myself) gets 3 stars but the service gets them an extra .5 (maybe .75) stars.
K W.}Brooklyn, NY}15}92}8}-1}4}12/22/2011}one of the best soba places in the city!went there with one of my friends while she was visiting the city and we had a great time there.  since it was just 2 of us, we easily got seats by the chef's bar and the chef was very nice to us.  i got one of the veggie sobas (yasai) and it was simply declicious!  the soba tasted extremely fresh, and the broth was savory yet refreshing.  we also got a couple of small appetizers to share (agedashi tofu & maguro yamakake).  they were also really really good.  i think because they homemade all of the tofu and sauces, the dishes all end up really freash.  we even end up with an extra dish for free because the chef starting making a dish for us, but then he realized it was the wrong dish.  that was nice =)finally, the dessert... i don't remember what my friend got (oops), but i got the strawberry tofu... and it was the best thing ever!  forget almond tofu... this thing is the real stuff!!!  love this place...  =)
Adam E.}Manhattan, NY}259}14}2}-1}5}12/22/2011}The soba salad is amazing...  I also love the rice bowls and the pork belly app...  The staff is very friendly and does a good job turning tables without making you feel rushed or uncomfortable.  In my opinion if you're in the mood for soba noodles there is nowhere better.
Annie C.}San Jose, CA}1}105}14}-1}4}12/21/2011}My favorite food is Udon.  So, when I visited NY, my friend suggested this place. The place was just packed with people. Even though we had everyone in our group (4), we waited almost 1.5 hours to sit. They suggested us to sit in groups of two at one point. The noodles were really delicious. We had, nabayaki udon, vegetable udon, tempura udon, duck something soba. They were all excellent. Probably one of the best. I would love to give 5 stars but 1star is deducted for messing up my order (I asked for no egg on my udon) and 1.5 hours of wait is long long time to wait for any kind of food.
Wing L.}Long Island, NY}204}245}78}-1}3}12/15/2011}The aroma walking in will entice you; there's just something about it's broth.Ramen lines were long and udon shops haven't tapped the market yet, so soba is the next best alternative to a cold winter.It's been a while since I last came here and while I wanted to give it a higher score, the overall experience was just "A-OK."The noodles came in 3 sizes. Let's face it, this place ain't cheap so you might as well pay for the largest to "satisfy" your craving.  I decided to get the large bowl of duck soba while my friend got the Regular bow.  The bowls are EXACTLY the same size but the portion is just more.  My friend did mention that she was still hungry afterward so if you're a big eater, maybe a regular isn't for you.  Be a fat-ass like me and opt for the Large.I used to like the noodles because they had a good bounce/ consistency (hand pulled) but when I tried it, it tasted like soba noodles that I buy in the Japanese market.  Really couldn't tell the difference between fresh hand pulled and store bought, which made justifying the price a bit hard.The duck was a little tough and chewy, unfortunately.  No fat on the duck though (which was nice) but it was overcooked.  The reedeming factor was the broth though; it had a slight tangy/ sour taste that somehow just works for soba noodles.For dessert, we got the tofu gelatin dessert.  While good, at $4.50, it's another pricey dessert (small portion).I'm a big eater and while Soba-ya satisfied my craving for soba noodles (briefly), I was hungry an hour later.  However, the price paid for 1 bowl and 1 dessert was equivalent to eating a bigger meal elsewhere.
Dong V.}Manhattan, NY}18}34}23}-1}4}12/12/2011}pretty nice restaurant. we went there around 6pm last night,and it wasn't full. but in 10mins, the whole place is filled with people, which is a very good sign. we ordered hashitashi, tempura and zaru soba. everything is good, except one thing made me feel a little uncomfortable. they didn't put the daikon( white radish) in with the wasabi and scallions, which is very unusual, because daikon is such a basic ingredients in Japanese food.  it should always come with the zaru soba or tempura. they gave it with the tempura, but they didn't give it with our soba noodle. my husband asked for it, and the most unheard thing is the waitress said it will cost you around $1.00. then i was very shocked, but i still want it. then i said sure. it turned out $0.75, but still, they charge you the ingredient is supposed to be included in the dish. overall this place is fine, nothing really specially good or bad.
Erica B.}Brooklyn, NY}1}58}0}-1}4}12/11/2011}Definitely need to keep coming here to explore the amazing menu.Last night was my first time; had the lotus roots with ume paste and minced shiso leaf,  delicious. And the special rice bowl, which included finely chopped chunks of tuna, salmon, egg, shrimp, shittake, and eel sushi on a bed of rice. Everything was wonderful. The sake prices are a bit shocking here. All the vegetable side dishes look like winners, I need to come back just to try the rest of them.Meanwhile I didn't even get to the soba!I was lucky to enter this place on a Saturday night at 5:30pm when it was easy to get in. By the time I was paying my bill an hour later there was a line out the door for tables.Most certainly coming back for more as soon as I can...
May L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}591}464}229}18}2}12/10/2011}I went to Soba-ya after attending "Cupcake takes the Cake" to try to get the sugar out of my system and heel from the angry stares of others.  Apparently, no one at a cupcake event likes the skinny girl who brought a date.  Oh Soba-ya, I so BADLY wanted to be like all the other yelpers that love you.  The complicit "ya" in your name just seems so positive.  And yet, 2 stars... cue sad music.First, the service and atmosphere is wonderful.  I can't complain about that.  Attentive.  Considerate.  We received green tea while we waited at the door.I had the Monday.  Which was a special on the Kitsune.  My date had the Nishen.  The presentation was beautiful for both, but the taste, underwhelming.Perhaps, I need to come to terms with the fact that I like more complicated broths. I felt like someone had just poured water over the existing ingredients in the bowl to create this soup. The ingredients were wonderful and the pairings made - more or less - sense.  I didn't like the that the weird pink/tofu/fish thing was soaked in sugar before being added.  Just unnecessary.  The fish broth was so fish and mine was just eh.  I feel like I should give them another chance given the hype + longevity of the restaurant + the reviews appear to highlight non-noodle options.  But for now, you get 2 stars.
Casey C.}Irvine, CA}373}509}52}-1}3}12/6/2011}Pricey but good... keep in mind I'm from OC/LA So Cal so price is relative.But the flavors were good and the options are good. Noodles cooked right. Soup base tasty but not over powering or salty. Service and atmosphere was good too.
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}4}12/3/2011}Ippudo is my go-to place for ramen. But sometimes what I crave is udon. The thing is, unlike ramen or soba, udon hasn't exactly broken through the Western culinary mainstream. So when I realized that Sobaya serves udon as well I had to go try it.The broth in udon is unlike any other. I crave it's aroma. And Sobaya's udon was 4 stars. Not quite as perfect as I would like it to be, but the broth has depth, the noodles it's character and add a dash of Shitchimi and it perks up the whole bowl. I prefer tanuki udon but also enjoy tempura udon very much. They have nightly specials which is great. This will definitely serve as my udon place for a while.
Maria N.}Astoria, NY}1}14}0}-1}4}12/3/2011}A GREAT place for lunch.  A group of 4 co-workers and I usually go twice a month and typically get the under $20 bento box, which is well worth it ... tempura, cooked veggies, a broiled fish (changes depending on the day, soba (hot or cold) and a salad.
Stacey S.}New York, NY}123}76}17}-1}3}12/2/2011}I once used to love eating here and it wasn't uncommon for me to suggest Soba-ya at least once a month. I'm not sure why but I think the quality has deteriorated over the past year. Whereas before, it used to feel like each dish was prepared by someone who actually cared about the food I was going to be served, nowadays it feels like a few line cooks just throw together the ingredients like they're mass preparing cafeteria food. It's a soba place. So when your soba dish comes out with portions of your soba stuck frozen together, you sort of wonder if there's any reason for you to return... other than the fond memories of when it used to be so good.
Jenny C.}Easton, PA}1}32}0}-1}4}11/21/2011}There is almost always a wait here (for dinner especially) but the food is delicious. I love their sweet potatoes, braised duck and pork belly dishes. Their yuzu soy cod is also excellent. I have not tried their soba soups, but the dipping sauce for the cold soba is good and you can add however much wasabi and scallions you'd like. They do give more broth; however, I've almost always been close to finished with my soba by the time they've delivered the broth. I'm not sure if it's still around, but I used to get the milk pudding dessert a couple years ago and it was great. Very light, not heavy at all.It is a bit expensive, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.
mayra T.}Calgary, Canada}0}14}0}-1}5}11/20/2011}I have been eating Japanese food all my life, and I can tell you that this is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever been.Green tea is authentic, fish is fresh, rice bowl with tuna sashimi was delicious. It was a table of 4 and we were all very satisfied with the food.They are making the noodles at the front of the restaurant, pretty cool to watch.
Hannah S.}Boyce, VA}4}7}1}-1}4}11/13/2011}I've been to Soba-ya twice and loved it both times.  Of course, both times I got the salmon and salmon roe over rice with soba noodles, which is delicious!  The first time I got cold soba, and the second time it was hot soba.  I liked the cold soba better, personally, but both were yummy.  I've only been during lunch, when the prices are a little more reasonable for a college student.  I also tried the ice cream once.  My favorite was the yuza flavor. The black sesame was good, too, but I wasn't a huge fan of the honey wasabi.  It was an interesting flavor, but very strong, so I could only manage a few small bites.
H H.}Dublin, CA}69}457}124}-1}4}11/10/2011}My friend and I ordered the soba with the duck.  I thought it was a little too salty for my taste, but I forgave the saltiness because you can taste the detail of the soba and the soup.  My friend told me that the soba is actually made from flour flown from Japan and all hand-made.  Even in the soup, you can taste and see small slivers of orange zest, ginger and onions.  The soba was also delicious because it wasn't too hard, too soft, it was just the right consistency.  They also gave us a generous amount of duck; it was flavored deliciously, but I think its slightly a little overcooked because it was slightly tough.  But overall it was delicious!  The agedashi tofu is pretty derricious too.It's slightly more than I was expecting, it was approximately $50 plus for all of this.I thought service was pretty good and quick.  We got everything before we finished our sentences.
Julia L.}San Francisco, CA}14}82}0}-1}2}11/9/2011}Am I missing something? I tried their seasonal soba and I thought the soup was sour / off. There werent any veggies in the soup...it was literally just soba and 3 oysters (oysters were cooked well). And it was $18...The people dining around me didn't get soba...but this place IS called Soba-ya. I'm confused.Also, the calpico was watered down.I'll probably try something else next time or try a cold soba. I might have just picked the wrong thing?
James C.}Manhattan, NY}167}190}107}18}4}10/25/2011}One of my staple japanese noodle places. I tend to come here for lunch as the prices are more to my liking seeing that their dinner and lunch prices are different but the menu is basically the same. The thing I usually like to order would be the rice dish with the chopped raw fish. It comes with Soba as well. I think if I came in here for dinner and with their prices I would be Meh and have it as 3 stars. This is a solid lunch place
lore f.}Jersey City, NJ}21}195}17}-1}3}10/25/2011}4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service They tell you at the door "15minutes wait", that actually translates to 1 hour wait. If I'm going to wait an hour might as well eat at cocoran.
Lisa H.}Brooklyn, NY}548}279}4757}-1}2}10/13/2011}Extremely mediocre for the height of expectations I had heading to Soba-ya for dinner yesterday night. There was no rain- possibly due to the somber weather, which was an upside after hearing that people wait close to an hour even on a weekday. We ordered the pork belly and cod for appetizers. The pork belly came in a bowl of soy sauce based broth with scallions, horseradish and a poached egg on the side. The pork belly was meh- chewy and not tender as most pork belly is. On the other hand, the "gindara"- yuzu infused soy cured cod was buttery, flakey and melt in your mouth delicious. If I knew it was this good, I would've opted for 2 orders of cod instead of the pork belly.As for the main, I ordered the soba noodles with sea urchin. Personally, I didn't enjoy this at all. The soba noodles were harder than I preferred, and it came with a yam foam which when mixed in with the soy, produced a mucusy soup base. This made the dish look very unappetizing.. and also felt gross when I slurped it up. As for my friends choices in mains- Nishin and Tanuki.. both soups were extremely salty.As for the desserts.. we ordered three different flavours of ice cream- the honey wasabi, green tea and black sesame. All were delicious! The green tea was especially bold and flavourful. I hope the next time I come I have a better experience than this. I had really high hopes for Sobaya.. but after trying it, it definitely falls out of the radar when compared to Cocoran.
Mina J.}Jersey City, NJ}25}72}38}-1}5}10/13/2011}One of my top few favorite Japanese restaurants in the East Village, Soba-ya hits the spot every time. It's not common to find a place that focuses on soba and udon and does both quickly and to perfection. I've never had a problem getting a table here, and the wait staff is generally very efficient and accommodating. I often order the Nabeyaki Udon, but last time I tried the soba salad which had many elements to it and was super tasty. I also often order Calpico and soda to drink, which if you haven't tried yet you should. At the end of each meal here I almost always save room for their yuzu ice cream, which comes with fried noodles on top and is the most delicious alternative ice cream in the universe.If you claim to love Japanese food but only eat sushi and teriyaki, it's time to broaden your horizons and visit Soba-ya!p.s. - It was a happy coincidence when we were seated next to Chloe Sevigny's table one evening. :)
Pinky And The B.}Manhattan, NY}852}1468}5797}-1}4}10/5/2011Updatedreview}Nothing has changed for me since I first reviewed Soba Ya. I Have been 4 times since the first review. Twice for dinner and twice for lunch. I guess I had a different experience  than other reviewers because I felt the lunch special was a good value. The portions are generous , the service good the food is quality and the place is clean. They even serve dessert including in the lunch special. It was a custard with  a Strawberry, I am no stranger to Japanese food. Here is my NYC Japanese food list. yelp.com/list/japanese-r…Here is my nation wide Japanese list. yelp.com/list/my-nation-…I do not think you can find this value in Tokyo. The quality is very good for New York. After coming back from Honolulu last time I had a hard time eating sushi because the sushi here tastes like plastic compared to sushi in Honolulu. Our first sushi stop was sushi Yasuda. The fish I had was half frozen and very disappointing there, I came to Soba Ya for the Soba which was delicious  but have also had sushi at Soba Ya  and it was some of the freshest fish I have had in NYC lately. And as I said in my previous review, most Soba in NYC is a mix of wheat and Buckwheat.Here at Soba Ya it is 100%  Buckwheat imported from Japan.
Alan C.}San Jose, CA}2}2}0}-1}5}9/30/2011}Fantastic! Especially for the 1 free drink coupon from yelp for checking in. We sat at the bar and I dare say got way more attention and service from the bartender since she was in front of us the whole time. This was way more fun than sitting at the table being served. Not only did they give us large portions even though we ordered the "small" they offered small dishes for us to try. We ended the meal with a wonderful dessert that was similar to mango melon. GO!
Matt M.}Manhattan, NY}63}322}18}-1}4}9/29/2011}We tried the salmon rice bowl and the Tanuki soba noodles tonight and both dishes were quite good.  The rice bowl was topped with salmon roe and fresh salmon sashimi - and the rice had excellent flavor too.  We got the small, which was enough food for a decent dinner and only $10.00.  The Tanuki was a nice noodle soup bowl.  The broth was medium in color and strength and was very flavorful. The soba noodles had great flavor and were high quality.  Overall, this was a great sized dinner and very enjoyable.  I believe the Tanuki has some little fried onion pieces and a fish cake in it.  This bowl was only $11.50 and a great deal.
Serena C.}Los Angeles, CA}667}405}861}-1}4}9/26/2011}Fresh authentic Japanese food at its best! The way to go here is definitely ordering off their Lunch Special menu--more food at a lower cost FTW! Being the greedy chubby bunny that I am, I went with the Maguro Don Lunch Set with Cold Soba Noodles. The maguro don came with 7 superb thick, beautiful slices of tuna and a nice large shiso leaf on sushi rice. Very delicious. And the cold soba, oh man..... I've never had anything like it. So amazing! The fact that the soba noodles are made fresh daily at the restaurant made all the difference in the world--the texture, the flavors, etc.I also got a chance to try some seared tuna from my friend's Tunasteak-don. If seared tuna is your thing, it's not to be missed. They give you 8 large slices of tuna that's been lightly seared along the edges with a ginger soy marinade atop. Don't hesitate to stop by the soba-making station at the front of the restaurant if you see the guy there making it. It's pretty neat and cool to watch!
Abby B.}Jersey City, NY}0}5}0}-1}2}9/19/2011}The appetizers are ok, and seared tuna fish over rice was good.  Sake and beer selections are acceptable.  What's wrong is this place call themselves soba-ya, place of buckwheat noodle have a bad soba noodle dishes.  Noodles are either too cooked--soggy or too hard, tastes like soba that we can buy from Asian stores, it cannot be hand-maid on that premise.
Erica S.}Manhattan, NY}277}210}26}-1}3}9/16/2011}This place is definitely hit or miss. If you don't like soba/udon this is definitely not the place for you.I've been here twice. My friends kept telling me how great this place was so I came to check it out and got the hot soba noodles. Definitely was not a fan-- I don't think soba can get that fancy and nothing I can't make at home. I also had the pork belly which I thought was delicious though! My review for my first trip here would have probably been a 2.The second time I cam here, I came with the friend who raved about how great this place was. I tried the salmon don per her recommendation and loved it! It is huge! and has all varieties of minced salmon that you can think of! Although my second trip was better, I'm not sure I would come all the way over here just to get one good thing on the menu.
David K.}Paramus, NJ}44}80}30}-1}3}9/15/2011}On a hot summer day what could be better than a some cold soba to cool you off?We had the Tem Zaru soba and the Nameko Oroshi.Noodles were cooked well and overall presentation was really good.I would come back again to try some other dishes.
Debbie P.}Venice, CA}0}29}0}-1}4}9/10/2011}Ahhhh this place is so freaking good!!! My friend from Paris has been visiting for the past week, and last night he had a hankering for Japanese food.  A quick walk across Manhattan lead us to the door of Soba-ya.We were seated quickly and placed out orders.  We had the tofu sashimi and sweet potato appetizers to share.  For entrees, I ordered the Soba Salad and my friend had the hot soba with duck and mushrooms.Everything was delicious, delivered fast and accurate.Why 4 stars you might ask?  The vegan menu is very limited (Soba Salad is the only option.  Yes, it's delicious but ONLY OPTION.)  Also, vegetarians be aware that they use fish broth in most of their dishes.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}3}9/10/2011}Everything is of high quality here, and we were surprised to see the B rating sanitation grade they received.  This did not hinder us to exploring their hand made soba noodles though.  If you check in with yelp you get a free sake, soda, or beer! score.  As for appetizers we ordered the shiso sasami which was chicken tenders wrapped with shiso leaves with tempura batter served with a side of green tea salt.  It was just OK, not as good as it sounded.  The soba dish i ordered was one of the daily specials the Age Tofu which was 2 pieces of large fried tofu with yuzu chili infuzed in the middle served in a fish based broth.  The broth was yummy, and the yuzu chili tofus were pretty awesome.  They also give you a choice of either soba or udon, but comon if the name of your restaurant is Soba-ya you already know what to choose.  Unfortunately I have discovered that soba is one of my least favorite types of noodles.Good broth, but lacking noodles
Mike A.}Staten Island, NY}49}10}0}-1}4}9/5/2011}First off... The Soba I had here was perfect! Perfect texture and flavor! I recommend trying it w/  duck, the flavors are spot on. For an appetizer we enjoyed a single piece of uni on top of a cup half full of fish jelly. The jelly was clear to the eye and clean to the taste and went very well with the uni. We washed this all down with a cup of there green tea which was definitively a variation of Genmaicha (one of my favs!) in a cup I swore I have seen for sale in Pearl River Mart.Unfortunately this place will need to loose a star for their rude service. The worst came when our waiter asked us if we were having dessert, and when we declined he made some comment under his breath and walked away.
Susie S.}San Jose, CA}217}169}40}-1}4}9/3/2011}AMAZING food. The lunch box is especially amazing. You can literally taste a bit of everything! And the dessert.. God bless Japanese people!I also loooove the Uni Tororo as an appetizer. You'll love it if you love uni.However, it loses one star for the price. If you want to order an appetizer too, you should expect around $50 for 2 people for lunch.
Gracie h.}Brooklyn, NY}2}68}1}-1}4}9/1/2011}very well done elegant restaurant. delicate flavors for the duck soba.
Bjorn P.}New York, NY}22}641}654}-1}3}9/1/2011}Clean, cozy Japanese restaurant. Friendly service. Got packed - on  a Tuesday. I even liked the bathrooms. Sashimi was very fresh and good - had the assortment. Had cold soba - I liked it but didn't love it. The tempura was very good. I would go again to try the hot soba - I know people who know that say eating cold soba is the way to do it - but perhaps wasn't in the mood. Very good honey wasabi, sesame and yuzu ice cream. Good sake - both Junmai and Nogori.
Denrick B.}Chicago, IL}96}41}18}-1}4}8/31/2011}Amazing food but terrible service!I had the pork belly as an appetizer and the naebeyaki udon, and both dishes were  divine. The pork belly melted in my mouth like butter, and I was an inch  away from disregarding my table manners just so I can lick the savory broth off the bowl. I just wish the server had told us more about the dish and instructed us to mix the broth-egg-horseradish medley before biting into chunks of horseradish.5 stars for the food less a star for the wasabi nose burn yields a solid 4 star for this intimate, authentic soba joint.
Stephen D.}Bergen County, NJ}213}571}175}-1}4}8/30/2011}There was a 1 hour wait on a Tuesday night at 7:30 pm which is a good sign. There were 6 of us and they had no problem accommodating us all. The menu is varied, alot of soba & udon dishes, some sushi dishes as well as your more americanized asian food. The ambiance is loud and the service is quick. It's a tight fit so remember not to bring large bags/luggage/childrenI had the cold soba with duck broth, the broth was so deliciously salty combined with the cold noodles made for a great treat. The lady had a tartare done, with 3 types of tartare (salmon, tuna, bonito? (maybe)) it was delicious, the fish was fresh and the tartare seasonings were rich.Overall cool experience, the food seemed authentic and fresh and for the price is can't be beat.
mona k.}New York, NY}147}73}17}-1}1}8/30/2011}If there were a zero star rating, I would have given it that. It doesn't even deserve one star. First of all, the soba noodles were like shredded cardboard boxes. The soup/ sauce of soba was worse than store brand ones. It had weird burnt and acidic taste. Everything was wayyyyyy too salty. Tuna tartar was blend, and when I asked for small dish for soy sauce they told me to pour the soy sauce on the top. What the..? I was starving when I got there but could not stand eating this food. The only thing I could bear from this place was their hot tea. Will never go back or recommend it to anyone. Sanitary rating B didn't look so good either.
Jessica Y.}Los Angeles, CA}132}235}39}-1}4}8/27/2011}Delicious!We came here after randomly Yelping eateries around the East Village neighborhood. It was either this or a subway ride to Brooklyn's Robertas for some pizza. Good thing I chose this place.Coming from LA, I had my reservations about this place specializing in Soba. However, maintaing a four-star rating with 300+ reviews was a pretty good sign.The place is charming and cozy and despite having to wait a little before being seated, I have to say that the food and service was fantastic. With both of us wanting to try their specialty soba as well as some type of bowl, we took advantage of their lunch special. Ranging between $16-20, Soba-ya offers quite an extensive selection. I had the chirashi bowl + hot soba and my friend had the salmon sashimi and salmon roe bowl + hot soba.Needless to say, we pretty much sat in silence as we scarfed down our food. And for someone who tries to limit her carb intake, I happily downed my bowl of soba.Really, when I'm back in the city, I'll definitely come back!
Allie B.}New York, NY}29}53}0}-1}4}8/27/2011}Got the hot Udon noodle soup with mixed vegetables and mushrooms. It was amazing, I have never had soup like that. Highly recommended!
Sh F.}Manhattan, NY}0}40}8}-1}1}8/22/2011}First of all, the place got rated as "B" by health department, which is unacceptable given the price customers pay and types of fresh food the restaurant is serving.Most of my past visit, the place was O.K. but the latest made me feel not going back there, at least for a while.I ordered the combination of hot soba w/ Unagi domburi.Soba's broth was ridiculously salty and anyone could recognize it by looking at the broth. It's just too dark! It must've been heated for excessive amount of time. For any soba cook or server not to recognize it indicates lack of attention as a restaurant. The broth was among the key element and this kind of treatment killed the flavor as well as the taste.Ugani was another disappointment. It's not even similar to average re-cooked cheap Unagi and it seemed that they've done the similar too much heating for this one as well...Another disturbing thing was that whenever there are more customers, they started to pressure customers to leave even if they've just started to drink tea, which the servers brought as after-meal tea.For the price we are paying...are you kidding me?
Alphonse T.}New York, NY}33}49}1}-1}4}8/21/2011}The free Yelp offer for sake/kieran is great!! I had the Doshipura (?) rice bowl which was very filling, and flavorful. The place was packed on a Wednesday night, so our party of three had to sit  at the bar, which wasn't that bad though the waitress could hear our conversation. But fun place overall, on a quiet street with pretty good food!
Theresa L.}New York, NY}166}74}1}-1}5}8/17/2011}I'm a believer!Boyfriend RANTS AND RAVES about this place. He loves the tuna steak-don with a side of udon. The first time I went, I wasn't impressed. But, as I went back, I really grew to love the food. It's clean and simple- not overly dressed. Also, their hot green tea is fab!
Greg P.}Norwood, NJ}197}108}28}-1}4}8/16/2011}Authentic Japanese Noodle house. The cold noodle dishes are better then the hot, but both are delicious. I had the Nabeyaki Udon. The broth was nice, rich and full of flavor. The appetizers are varied and good. The Tem Zaru was lovly, and next time I go, I will order a cold noodle dish. The wasabi ice cream has a real kick to it. Too much of a kick for my taste. Also, the crunch soba topping for the ice cream was too hard and didnt have enough sweetness.
Edouard M.}Pittsburgh, PA}21}107}0}-1}4}8/12/2011}The cold soba (tempura soba) was very refreshing for this hot summer night. The noodles were firm and tasty. The hot duck soba was good but less interesting. I am ambivalent about its broth: I found it somewhat tasteless at the beginning, but it got tastier. The lotus roots with pickled plums were very... plumsy. You could feel the lotus somewhat. A very nice place overall. Reasonable price too.
Carol L.}New York, NY}197}123}3}-1}3}8/8/2011}Had a group dinner at this place and the seating was a bit of a hassle. No chairs can be added so make sure you know exactly how many people are coming.I got the soba dinner deal which comes with a few appetizer pickled veggies, tempura, and soba. ~ 20 bucksIt was decent, but didn't absolutely amaze me. I wish I had tried some of their specialty sobas, maybe next time, but the dinner deal was a pretty good price.We ended up downing quite a few bottles of sake and the food did come out in pretty good time. The atmosphere of the place was nice.
Kanako I.}Chicago, IL}3}33}56}-1}5}8/3/2011}There are just so many non authentic Japanese restaurants in NY but I LOVE this place.  Service is good, their hand-made soba is really good. Tempura is cooked great too. very light:) I am impressed that they even serve Sobayu. P.S. Their broth is tokyo version of borth, not Osaka/Kyoto. So it's a little too salty for people from Osaka/Kyoto area.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}7/30/2011}Recommended:Kamo Namban Soba (hot): absolutely delicious soup and duck meat! Although there is quite a lot of duck in it, the soup doesn't get too oily. Tempura Udon (hot): their tempura is possibly the best in the city. Especially the shrimp tempura is to die for.I also tried their tartar don that comes with tuna, salmon and amberjack tartar. It was descent but you definitely shouldn't pass on their sobas and udons.Overall, this is definitely my favorite dinner spot in the neighborhood, and the best non-ramen noodle place in the city.
Hyatt B.}Manhattan, NY}300}5}0}-1}4}7/27/2011}Awesome Tempura Soba (Tem-Zaru)!! The Goma Ae (boiled spinach with sesame sauce and seeds) was also really good. My gf's hot soba on the other hand was not very good. Ended the meal with a Green Tea Brûlée, which was creamy and delicious. Overall a bit pricey for poor young ppl, but great for everyone else.
Aileen M.}Brooklyn, NY}22}21}0}-1}4}7/23/2011}Soba-ya makes pretty solid soba. What was ordered on a Saturday night for two: Appetizers: steamed egg custard with chicken and vegetable and the tuna tartare with japanese yam and avocado.Entrees: Ikura cold udon- with salmon roe and grated radish and the Kamo Seiro- with sliced duck and hot dipping sauce and green onion. The steamed egg appetizer was pretty satisfying and if you are Chinese- it will remind you of your grandma's homemade "steamed water egg" dish. Except, instead of using water, this steamed egg dish was made with rich chicken broth. It's a tiny appetizer, almost the size of one egg- with one piece of chicken and one piece of mushroom in it. Definitely plan on getting more apps if you are not dining alone. The tuna tartare was very fresh and the Japanese yam gave it a unique punch to it. Now onto the noodles, the correct consistency in their soba was something I really appreciated. The sliced duck was covered in tempura, in the dipping broth, which made it soggy and the duck meat was pretty dry (wasn't a fan). However, the broth itself was flavorful and had a soy tangy taste to it,  went well with the green onions and soba in it. The cold udon entree with salmon roe had a vinaigrette tasting broth to go along with it. Very refreshing on a hot summer day. The udon they served was not the same as the traditional ones you see in regular Japanese restaurants, they were much thinner, different. I actually prefer the thinner ones. Overall, the ambiance had a very authentic, tranquil, and homey feel to it, no rushing and kind service.
Valerie S.}St Paul, MN}42}94}3}-1}2}7/18/2011}I loved the ambiance and the authenticity of the place.I understand that quality food is not cheap, but $14.00 plus tip for a bowl of noodles with a few greens and a mushroom or two?.. uh..The broth and noodles were very flavorful and if you're a noodle enthusiast with a great amount of cash to throw into your desires, then this could be a good destination for you.Me on the other hand, I'd rather pay 14.00 for some sushi or protein.. not just carbs.
Piotr B.}San Francisco, CA}0}4}0}-1}4}7/18/2011}I was wandering New York a little while ago trying to find a restaurant that turns out had closed in the past year or so. Bummed by this discovery I started to wander the streets in search of food.I ended up yelp-ing this place, and they had a check in deal of a fresh sake with the meal. The food was great. The desert was delicious, although red bean pastries are something that may have to grow on you if you've never had them before.Overall I recommend the place. I won't go any deeper because it was a while ago, and I would rather keep mum rather than misinform. cheers.
Jay S.}Bethlehem, PA}1}5}0}-1}4}7/18/2011}Very nice atmosphere - the staff are friendly in this small Japanese noodle house.  The food was very good, the fish was extremely fresh - almost right out of the water!
Nancy L.}Bridgewater, NJ}114}309}309}-1}3}7/12/2011}I came here with my vegetarian friend and thus ordered separate dishes. She had three different dishes of veggies and especially loved the spinach one. I ordered the Amber Jack sashimi and duck soba (cold), which was recommended as a "must try" per our waitress. The sashimi was decent, but nothing close to Azabu standards. The duck soba was just alright, but I definitely regret that I gave in to the waitress' recommendation. Next time, if I do come back, I'll stay away from the duck and try the Uni or Tuna Soba. For dessert, I ordered the 3 homemade scoops combo for $6 and tried their wassabi, yuzu and black sesame ice cream. Surprisingly, I thought the wassabi ice cream was awesome and was actually my favorite amongst the three! The yuzu was good as well (has a citrus taste to it) and the black sesame was average. Anyway, okay experience here and would recommend it if you're a soba person (noodles are done really well), but would definitely skip the duck soba. PS: If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free beer or shot of sake!
C. N.}Geneva, Switzerland}1}19}23}-1}3}7/9/2011}3.5/5 to be accurate; been here 5 times, not because I adore it but because the preferred destinations nearby were packed or closedFood (3.5/5) being a soba-ya, the quality of the soba is good yet the soup lack of flavour and the dishes are salty in general, with overly greased tempura; this being said, however, certain sets are not bad for a quick lunch: bara chirashi, Kamo nanban w/ soba, nabeyaki for winter salvage; goma tofu and kaisou salad make fair starters, and milk tofu to finish. Lastly and sincerely, a 4.5/5 does apply to the decently done UnajuAmbience (4/5) well decorated, including the bathroomsService (4/5) friendly
Nancy P.}New York, NY}0}82}0}-1}4}6/28/2011}Every time I come here, I'm reminded why I love the simple, clean flavors of Japanese food so much. I've tried many of the noodle dishes, both cold and hot, usually with the soba. I would recommend trying the starter dishes...just amazing, clean flavors that I miss eating a largely Western diet even in NY. The eggplant and the sweet potatoes are two of my favorites. I usually go for the no frills cold or hot soba with the mushrooms and radish. For a more hearty and intensely flavored dish, the duck is delicious!
Tiffany L.}Brooklyn, NY}302}532}429}18}4}6/24/2011}pro: there's something very authentic about this place and the food is honest. they serve hot tea while you wait for a table! had a really interesting experience with the sea urchin (which i love) in fish broth jelly (which i found questionable). they have a pretty solid tempura soba. I like that they put the tempura on a separate plate so its not soggy when it gets to your table. TRY the WASABI ICE CREAM. con:  a little pricey for the portions.
Clemens W.}New York, NY}448}235}596}-1}4}6/18/2011}If you couldn't tell from the name this place is famous for its soba (buckwheat noodle). Because the noodle is handmade in the back by some pikachus and squirtles, it's magically delicious. I would rank it on the same level of Japanese quality soba.  You can actually see them make the noodle in the front sometimes.  It doesn't seem the most sanitary, but it's cool to see them do it.When you eat soba at a good soba place, it's always a good idea to have it cold. I order this Zarusoba because good quality soba can still be ruined if it's overcooked in the broth.  When it's cold and you get to dip it in some of their special soba sauce with wasabi, there's less of a chance it'll cook while you're slurping away.Whenever I'm near St Marks and in the mood for noodle, this is the place to go.
ghost g.}Edgewater, NJ}33}104}502}-1}3}6/14/2011}3 starsSoba-ya has been one of the few japanese restaurants that consistently has been in my rotation ever since it opened.  I average 2-4 meals at Soba-ya a month and have had virtually everything on the menu.It has time and time again provide to be a good value.  The portions are smaller given what they used to serve but I think its consistent with what your seeing across the city given the rise in food costs.As far as apps go:My fav is the  yuba sashimi, which is tofu wrapped in yuba raw bean curd.I know of no other restaurant at this price level that would even think about giving you real wasabi with a $6.50 app.  Kudos for real fresh minced wasabi root.Moving on to entrees:The Soba noodles are made in house and you can witness it first hand as there is generally a fellow making them for all to see in the main dining room.I prefer taking my soba the good ole fashion way which is cold with a little wasabi and dipped in the sauce that they provide.Otherwise I really enjoy the various sashimi "Dons" aka sashimi over rice bowl.The top Don in my humble opinion is the Salmon Oyako which is fresh salmon sashimi and salmon roe and of course real wasabi.#2 on my list is the Tuna Steak with garlic sauce over rice.  I think of it more as butter sauce because it taste like butta!#3 Is the fresh Tuna Sashimi over rice.#4 The Bara sashimi, think of it as a minced Chirashi over rice that includes Tuna, Salmon, Amberjack, eel, shrimp,squid,omelette, cucumber and shitake mushrooms.Last but not least, one of the most simple desserts that tastes great is the Milk Tofu, its a cross between Tofu custard and jello.i would say there best value is the lunch menu during the week and on Sundays.  Expect to spend about $30 bucks with tip if you go for entree and app.
Steph Z.}New York, NY}41}108}108}-1}4}6/14/2011}Had a great lunch last weekend with my friend, We had the lunch set with noodle soup and salmon roe and sashimi rice. Very yummy! Good quality. I would definitely go back there again!
April Joy C.}Brooklyn, NY}359}69}161}-1}4}6/14/2011}Surprise surprise, I'm an Asian that doesn't like pho or ramen.  So when I stumbled upon Soba-ya I quickly got excited and the quest was on to find someone who was willing to have Japanese noodles from neither Minca or Ippudo (both good but like I said I'm not a fan of ramen.)Soba, as it brings me to a "natsukashi" place, is definitely my favorite Asian noodle and Soba-ya gets it right.  I wish I wrote my review right after I went because I can't remember what was had, but I can say I've been there 2 more times since my initial visit.  What's great, is with my first check-in with yelp I got a free glass of sake.Oh yeah, their toilets, Toto.
Dennis B.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}20}0}-1}5}6/12/2011}If you want soba noodles, do yourself a favor and visit Soba-ya.  Reliably delicious house made soba, cold or hot, excellent service and comfortable atmosphere.
Kassy M.}San Diego, CA}260}1352}639}-1}5}6/12/2011}YUM! If you like authentic Japanese food and noodles, you will have a great dining experience at Sobaya. We stumbled upon this place on a weekday afternoon, and I am glad we decided to eat here. Getting the lunch special is probably the best way to go. For about $16, you can choose a rice dish paired with a noodle dish (soba or udon, hot or cold). I got the Magurodon (tuna over rice), which was absolutely delicious. If you enjoy big pieces of raw fish, this dish is for you. I think this was the first time I had a maguro-don in over 5 years. Maybe even 8 or 10!The cold soba that I ordered with my magurodon was tasty as well. The two dishes combined are very filling and definitely worth the money. I cannot remember the last time I had such a filling lunch. Note: check-in on Yelp and receive a free bottle of Kirin beer or sake!
Karen M.}Manhattan, NY}29}18}0}-1}4}6/6/2011}Fantastic service and wonderfully authentic Japanese food.  SOBA GOOD!
Suzi Y.}Brooklyn, NY}8}53}0}-1}4}5/29/2011}I ordered the eel on rice and the Yasai (mixed vegetable and mushrooms) udon soup, both very good. But the Green Tea ice cream is still my all time favorite, strong and rich the way Green Tea ice cream should be, though I didn't care too much for the crunchy noodle that comes with the ice cream, kind of greasy tasting.  I believed they changed the crunchy noodles to a more cheaper and greasier version. Sorry, no dice! Order the ice cream and skip the greasy stuff.
Chih C.}Manhattan, NY}49}19}1}-1}4}5/28/2011}Great place to eat if you are a soba and tempura fan.  This is one of the best for tempura...of course soba too.  Great combination of food and reasonable price.
Ada S.}Fremont, CA}115}50}29}-1}3}5/27/2011}Waited about 30-40 minutes to get a table for 2, even though after about 15 minutes, there were 3 tables for 4 open. I guess they only seat table for 2 for tables of 2 and tables for 4 for 3 or 4 people. (Kinda ridiculous)On the up side, the hostess offered hot tea/water for those waiting. I got the Nabeyaki Udon which was served reallyyy hot and it was delicious on a cold rainy day. My boyfriend got the Tem Zaru (cold soba). He said it was ok and that the noodles were good, but the sauce could have had more flavor.Also, free sake or small beer when you show them that you've checked in!
Anqi Y.}Glendale, NY}32}13}19}-1}3}5/25/2011}It is okay, not the best noodle. The soba soup is just so so. But I like the cod.
jl t.}Brooklyn, NY}4}8}0}-1}5}5/21/2011}I have been going here since 2001.  It's still amazing and always consistently good.  Service always consistently efficient and nice.They have great lunch specials.  Expect a wait for dinner.
Carter P.}Brooklyn, NY}22}25}0}-1}4}5/20/2011}Good for a real-deal soba fix.  Nice sake selection too.
Janice L.}Los Angeles, CA}101}499}629}18}3}5/19/2011}I had high hopes before coming to this place! Came here on a weekday, not very busy. Servers are nice though!They have a pretty good lunch menu with lots of food! They give you so much soba for their set lunch as well. The hot soba was just meh, kind of bland and lacked flavor. The soup wasn't special or anything. Disappointed. The don that came with it was huge too! My friend got the seared tuna don lunch set and she complained that the mushroom is too salty! Come here for lunch yall! Super worth it!
Nelson W.}New York, NY}440}535}923}18}4}5/13/2011}Sobaya offers the most consistent soba experience for both beginners and soba lovers. With each hot/cold soba variation, the light broth and chewy soba offers a refreshing, light, and healthy experience. Combining the food with good service and reasonable prices, Sobaya is the standard by which soba restaurants should be measured.The Kamo Seiro (cold soba with hot duck dipping sauce) is the ideal soba dish offering a refreshingly light, soba experience yet providing a filling meal for those with a big appetite. Soba options with tororo (grated yams) or yamakake (tuna) are best for those preferring to have room for dessert. Small plate lovers can have their own fun with a robust delicacies menu offering favorites such as Ika Meshi (cooked squid stuffed with sticky rice), Uni Tororo (Sea Urchin and Grated Yams), and Tuna Yuba-Maki. Not to leave the vegetarians out, the Moriawase offers you a flight of three vegetable appetizers for $11. Personal favorites include Nasu Nibitashi (fried eggplant), Satsuma Imo (sweet potato), and Ume Renkon (boiled lotus roots). Sobaya is definitely a spot made for repeat visits. A new adventure awaits each time you dine. A restaurant that can be relied on for new experiences? I can't remember the last time I used "relied" and "new" in the same sentence...
J 2 K.}New York, NY}83}357}37}-1}3}5/10/2011}Errrr, apparently, if you put your name down for two on the waiting list, and a new couple comes in to put their name down, YOU HAVE TO REMIND THE HOSTESS THAT YOU'RE ALSO WAITING.Unfortunately, I was a few seconds too late when she gave our table to the incoming couple. Green tea or no, what the fuck was that.Luckily, she realized her mistake, apologized 12374 times and when we were finally seated, hooked us up with a veggie side. Woosah.Also, free sake or Kirin when you check in. Woosah is now in full effect.I'm still trying to understand though the froth that was underneath my uni with my soba. It tasted like egg whites. It did not make my soba appetizing at all. BUT, I'm definitely going back and trying every single soba in this damn place.I like soba.
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}3}4/30/2011}Soba-ya can hit the spot if you have a noodle craving..They specialize in soba...duh!  AND Udon too. The extensive menu pays respect to both the black and white goodness :p Thank you Yelp!!...checked in and got me a complimentary glass of sake :) Yaya!
Martin M.}Bethesda, MD}0}7}0}-1}3}4/24/2011}The food was ok, but wasn't anything special.  Corcoron has better food and is a far more interesting place to visit.
Paul C.}Seattle, WA}230}184}13}-1}3}4/17/2011}Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but wasn't very impressed by this place. Perhaps it was built up too much. I don't remember what I ordered, but I remember it being a very drab affair. The saving grace was the service which was great.
Xuefan Z.}New York, NY}36}30}0}-1}3}4/14/2011}I came here once with boyfriend for lunch... mmm it's a bit difficult to rate because boyfriend's dish was reallly good and mine was kind of bad... He had the tem-don set with cold soba and I had Nishin...and mine was a bit more expensive too...I didn't have much of mine before I started stealing his food. His was soooo great! :D love every bit of it. Service was good. The free tea was good :) Tea is always good though... it's hard to mess that up.place is a bit pricy for me, but I may visit again~ and order tem-don set again of course.
Danny W.}Manhattan, NY}14}61}0}-1}4}4/13/2011}A staple restaurant that I go to whenever I'm in the neighborhood.  The food is cheap and delicious, just the way I like it.  My recommendation is if you are hungry and are waiting for a table, hop across the street to get the best takoyaki in town at the hole in the wall (forgot the name).The restaurant next door, Robataya, is also great (one of my favorites) and are by the same owners!
Diane C.}Hoboken, NJ}247}530}7}-1}4}4/10/2011Updatedreview}After a 2 year hiatus (see last review!) due to a horrible service experience, I finally returned after a 10k race and some deep cravings for soup and noodles.  I was skeptical... but the second those soba noodles hit my mouth, I realized that I stayed away for so long over a fluke service oversight and instantly fell back in love with the food here.  The order: Lunch Box with Hot Soba.  Not only was it an intense amount of food, most of it was good.  The tempura shrimp was perfect... hot soba delicious... veggies delicious!  The letdowns were an overcooked chicken chunk, overcooked salmon, and mushy rice ball - but the good were soooo good that the bad could easily be overlooked.  $17 for a lunch box may seem expensive, but you're getting Apps, Entree and Dessert.  Soba-ya, so glad you are back in my life!
Anna M.}New York, NY}31}25}5}-1}4}4/7/2011}Mmm kamonan! How it goes down so well! Lunch soba comes with inari! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff ( who doesn't appreciate a little "irrashaemase"?) get the ice cream ... I recommend yuzu or wasabi, and they come with crunchy sweet soba noodles! Or get they the bean bun. You can't go wrong.
Amy S.}Brooklyn, NY}100}485}124}-1}5}4/6/2011}I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.Soba here is so good. I always get the tem zaru (tempura and soba) and I'm always full and happy when I'm done eating. The staff are really friendly, good at refilling the water, and I don't know who it is but one of them is always smiling and really nice. (:I also love that they give you hot green tea at the end of your meal.. and it's really good tea too!
FU F.}Brooklyn, NY}21}303}2184}-1}5}4/4/2011}MY TOP MOST FAV in NYC for soba. So many diff things to choose from their menu. Everything is perfect from appetizers to desserts- love their black sesame ice cream. Yes, its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Love Love Love Soba-ya.
Colleen C.}Seattle, WA}4}79}0}-1}2}4/2/2011}bland food, beautifully prepared.i am not the best judge of bland food, as i like some flavor and heat in my food.  we tried the lunch box set as well as the daily special, eel, and just don't get it.give me some flavor!
Joe J.}Pequannock Township, NJ}66}61}0}-1}5}3/30/2011}sesame ice cream was so so, honey wasabi was excellent.
Jasz J.}Hollywood, CA}206}198}155}-1}2}3/28/2011}East Village seem to be the area on any normal weekend outing; not trying to yet EV got my attention w/ their night life! Sobaya was just across the street from my regular stop of 'octopus balls' Otafuku and with 45 mins wait to spare; we ate here, SOBA'ya! Thanks for no line, and got seated within a min, I was YES!  I hate waiting, even for good food, its like wasting my night away.. lol...Setting like a Japanese sushi house, it was a full house here, SAKE to start, it was windy coLD outside, hot sake was ordered!  While reading away trying to decide on what to choose from, we already finished our sake! oh boy!! more plz.. hehee... ok, finally ordered udon with fish cake... it was quick that my order came out.  Unexpected the boiled fish cake, and on top of that, it was 1 SML PC. I am like 'wtf'.. hehee, maybe lil sake talking.. so eating away my udon, I felt like I was wasting my Friday night dining away.  (subconscious mind -thinking about 'udon west') I am disappointed... I want to return my bowl of udon and whatever that was inside 'which was udon and small a&& piece of boiled fish cake'. yuck! So, I was being polite and just struggling to eat.. thank god for sake to drink!My way of feeling better on eating here is that I did good deed , for 'Dine Out for Japan Relief Week'.
John N.}Los Angeles, CA}445}1044}159}-1}2}3/26/2011}After hearing so many great thing about this place and how great their soba is so after waiting in line across the street for octopus balls which they ran out and would take 45min just to get them. We decided to go eat here. I been here before but couldn't get in because the wait was forever. We sat down and order ourself a regular hot sake and started to look over the menu, I wanted something with soba and I order myself the special of the night(littleneck with hot soba for $18) and my friend order the fried fish soba. Somehow I was picturing my soba on their own dish and a small soup w.littleneck inside. When it actually came out, it was just a bowl of soba noodle w.clam inside. Dang it cost freaky $18 for that and I keep thinking, for half of that money I could have eaten udon west down the street. My friend bowl came out and somehow it was udon instead, anyway it taste alot better then mine but it still doesn;t beat Udon West. I check in this place and found out that I get a free beer or a small sake and of course I got the sake. It was a nice bonus. Overall this meal felt more FORCE and nothing was really that good,. There tons of reviews on this place but personally i don't see why. The food isn't that good. The soba was ok ish the most. When I was walking out of here, i felt like being rip off and unplease about this whole experience. It cost me $45 buck but the only good thing about this is part of the money goes to helping Japan back on it feet so I was happy about that part but next time i rather donate the money for Japan then trying to eat here again.
Paul Y.}Manhattan, NY}10}13}0}-1}4}3/23/2011}Been here many times already. Still an great authentic Japanese restaurant.  I am not a fan of soba in general so cannot comment much on the soba noodles.  The udon however, is delicious.  I suggest the chirashi if you are hungry (too much rice) and also the special monkfish liver pate.
Alli H.}New York, NY}173}595}53}-1}4}3/19/2011}You know an ethnic restaurant is good based on the clientele there. We were some of the only white people there which was a good sign when we walked in.We also got all of the white people food: edamame, shumai, tempura udon and vegetable soba noodles.Everything was super tasty and the service was good. My friend had a mixer saki drink which was pretty fantastic, I almost stole it from her..The wait was only 15 minutes around 7:30 on a friday night also.
Linh N.}Brooklyn, NY}169}540}1462}-1}4}3/18/2011}Small place but great food. The service was pretty on point too. I got seated by the bar with the bartender fixing me a nice refreshing drink for an autumn lunch.The place was definitely clean, gives a cottage feeling with the ceiling being quite low. I ordered the lunchbox special which consist of a lot of stuff. And of course, how can I not order soba when going to a soba noodle shop.Lunchbox Special - Green salad, cold soba noodles, vegetable, chicken, fish, tempura, rice, and dessert. All for just $17 and it was definitely worth the deal. The feeling felt authentic and the best part was eating the soba. They give you a small pot of broth to pour into your soy sauce as a completion to your meal, just drink the broth and absorb the goodness. Traditional? Yes.And the dessert was cute, small but enough to satisfy the sweet tooth after a big lunch.
Helen C.}South San Francisco, CA}3}10}7}-1}4}3/17/2011}soba-ya graciously took us in during the blizzard at the end of 2010. It was freezing outside and we were rejected by ippudo. Nice warm hand towel rocked my world. We were not rushed enough though they were closing up after lunch at 3:30 and the house made noodles were bomb. The wasabi ice cream is an acquired taste so tread carefully but on the plus side it cured my stuffy nose. Will visit again.
Ann P.}Huntington Beach, CA}198}35}28}-1}4}3/14/2011}Too bad I'm a fan of a place that's 2,300 miles away from my house.  On our vacation in New York, my hubby and I went to Sobaya on a recommendation from an east coast friend.  The first soba noodle experience I had was on Asiana Airlines... of course airplane food sucks, so the next time I ate it was at a Chinese AYCE buffet.  I think you know the answer to that.  I came in hoping that Sobaya's freshly made soba better be good or I am wasting $16 for a bowl of empty promises.  We were welcomed, promptly seated, given a cup of complimentary green tea and a hot towel.  Uh, getting flash backs of Asiana, but an excellent start nevertheless.  I ordered the Kamo which was a hot soup soba with slices of tender duck breast on top.  It also came was two pieces of inari nigri (deep fried tofu on top of sushi rice).  Yummy bonus.  The broth was filling, comforting, and rich with the addition of generous duck breast slices on top.  The thing that surprised me the most was how savory yet citrusy the broth tasted but I couldn't detect what they used to make it.  And yes, the soba was delicious.  The soba was soft and soaked up the flavor of the broth. My husband ordered the $17 lunch box which had veggie and shrimp tempura, salad, grilled salmon, inari nigiri, and assorted Japanese marinated veggies (yam, lotus root, carrot, cube of chicken!?), and a choice of hot or cold soba (cold).  The soba here was the star as we dipped the fresh noodle into the bowl of cold broth.  I'm very impressed with the service and the authenticity of the food.  The meal ended with a complimentary strawberry jelly dessert to share. I would recommend coming to try this place out if you are ever in the area.  Get the cold soba if you want to really appreciate al dente noodles or a hot soup for softer noodles and warm fuzzies.  BTW, do airlines still give hot towels to passengers?
Justine H.}New York, NY}61}141}0}-1}3}3/7/2011}go here for the soba and udon, and expect very good, perfectly cooked noodles with friendly and polite service. expect the same quality out of anything else on their menu and you're likely to be let down.the seared salmon sashimi was light, but lacked the creaminess & richness one can so crave when eating salmon. the ika meshi (squid stuffed with sticky rice) tasted a bit too much of squid in a way that i disliked. the shiso sasami (tempura - chicken tender wrapped in shiso leaf, served with green tea sea salt) was the best non-noodle dish we had all evening, but even there, found the flavors between the chicken and shiso to be unbalanced, weighing a bit too heavily on the chicken and losing almost all of the amazing shiso. most of all, i cant seem to get their special seasonal item out of my head. it was some lotus root dumpling with crab meat stuffed inside. while it sounded interesting on the menu, and looked delightlyfully plump in the bowl, the second my tongue hit the middle of that dumpling, i knew i had been deceived. it was dry & flaky, and while the inside may have been crab, it tasted more like dried up tuna than anything else. pass.the sobas (zen for me, ikura oroshi for him) were the finale to the meal, and thank goodness they were, for without those two bright exclamation marks at the end, i dont know that we would ever make it back.
Bang T.}Elkins Park, PA}91}85}55}-1}4}3/5/2011}great ambiance, food is magnificent, hard to find soba that is as good as it is in japan. but this place definitely does it right.
Che W.}New York, NY}38}186}6}-1}4}3/4/2011}We love this place but REALLY wish they could DIM THE LIGHTS a bit at dinner time--it would add a lot to the ambiance. I don't recommend for a date for this reason unless you don't care about that sort of thing.Also sat at the bar last time and all their yummy vegetable sides are sort of on display--but with saran wrap covering. I'd recommend they invest in a nicer way of presenting.Great food, but could use just a touch more attention to detail to really take it up a notch. Sparkling sake would be a nice addition too.
LaBruja V.}Miami, FL}21}13}2}-1}4}2/28/2011}Lunch combo was a bit too much, and I eat a lot! I would go for one of the sashimi bowls (e.g., rice and tuna) if you don't want to go back to work in a coma. All great food, though!The ambiance transports you - when you step back outside, you'll wonder how you ever got away from loud, fetid 9th street.
Devi B.}Somerville, MA}11}29}20}-1}5}2/22/2011}Small spot with a true Japanese feel to it. Authentic soba and udon. I ordered the curry soba for lunch and loved it. Excellent service!
Katherine L.}Flushing, NY}83}66}27}-1}4}2/20/2011}Came here tonight with friends.  The wait for a table is a bit long, but if you have the time, it's worth it.  I ordered the Yasai which is mixed vegetables & soba noodles.  Everyone enjoyed their food & the service was good.  I would like to come back & try other dishes.
Jurgen J.}Columbus, OH}112}139}41}-1}3}2/17/2011}I was pleasantly surprised with the first few dishes in this place. The spinach and butternut squash appetizers are great opener. Both the cod and tempura was also very nicely done. I have to say this is one of my favorite tempura in the city. It's also a good deal when you consider the price.I expect the soba to be the kings of sobas, like what ippudo have with their ramen. I ordered the cold duck soba. It was disappointing. My sister, who has dined at this place a few times before also agreed me with that the soba was way to soft. The duck was also hard to chew, it was incredibly hard. My disappointing meal continued with dessert. We had the (rice?) cake with red beans inside. It tasted weird, we didn't even eat the cake and went straight the red beans.Surely, this is my first try. I will still go back to have the damn good tempuras.
Lisa S.}New York, NY}2}19}0}-1}5}2/15/2011}Love the food, the atmosphere, they're always pleasant and you can show up on a Friday night and not have to wait too long. One of my favorite spots for udon!
Dana F.}Queens, NY}669}925}146}-1}4}2/8/2011}Winter, I'm really over you.  Until you decide to stop torturing me in the form of crippling various transportation systems and ensuring my body temperature never exceeds 97 degrees, I'm going to eat all sorts of comfort food.  Count me out for braving the wait at Ippudo. When my good friend who has traveled extensively to Japan suggested Soba-ya, I knew I was in for a treat.  The two of us decided that it was "one of those days" and that we needed a drink.  My ginger yuzu cocktail was deliciously smooth (oh, that sake) and tangy.The two of us shared roast duck with mustard to start.  The duck was cooked medium and it was a little bit tough.  Although it was good, I am not sure I would order this again.The soba, on the other hand, was fantastic.  I ordered the cold tororo noodles that comes with mountain yam.  Mountain yam is quite healthy for a tuber and when grated, is a mushy, sticky, slightly foamy substance.  Do not let looks deceive you; it is extremely mild tasting and the stickiness makes it bind to the noodles very nicely.After filling up on a great bowl of noodles (I ate the whole thing!), there was no room in my stomach for dessert.Our service was friendly and efficient and made sure that we always had full cups of green tea.
Andy D.}New York, NY}17}42}1}-1}5}2/6/2011}Standout service, food quality, and decor for a place so inexpensive. Love it.
Scott C.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}17}0}-1}5}2/6/2011}Great SOBA. I lived in Japan for many years and this is definitely authentic. Also, BURDOCK ROOT was good and good SAKE selection. Overall, the place is overpriced but almost worth it for genuine soba.It's called soba-ya for a reason, so get SOBA. It's flown in from Nagano (that's good, by the way).  Tanuki soba, yasai soba, tororo soba (my fav), nice simple Japanese dishes that taste like they should - clean, healthy and delish! Ambiance is similar to a soba shop in Japan.Do not get things like CURRY SOBA. Seriously. Does this sound good to you - buckwheat noodles with curry powder and chicken bits? These are Americanized dishes that no restaurant in Japan would touch for obvious reasons - they're gross (and, honestly, just wrong).... Also, duck soba isn't very Japanese -  at least not where I lived. Japanese food is subtle, not bursting with a hundred different spices, and chicken/fowl isn't everpresent. Avoid these things because I can tell you they suck just based on the concept of them.If you don't like simple, subtle food, you do not like Japanese food and it's better to go elsewhere.
Michal A.}Miami Beach, FL}463}145}84}-1}4}1/30/2011}Try the Seasonal Soba (or Soba of the day). What a beautiful experience! The Lunch Box is kind of a great deal, you will be satisfied after finishing that meal!
veronica s.}New York, NY}13}9}1}-1}3}1/30/2011}Food: 4 starAmbiance: 2 starI went here on a saturday night with 6 friends.  We waited 45 min to be seated - not so bad for a weekend night and a large party.   First thing to notice is that its super bright, so i think that it would be great for lunch however the bright lights at night are icky.  this is not a date place....more of like being in a middle school cafeteria.Here's how it works:  order a bunch of 'delicacies'  for the table and then everyone get their own noodle bowl.  (i love that they call the appetisers delicacies!) All the noodles are delicious - you can taste that they are super fresh. I ordered the daily special :  duck and mushroom udon but had serious food envy for everyone that ordered the nabeyaki udon (tempura shrimp and egg and all kinds of yummy stuff)as for delicacies the highlights are : #1  eggplant (vinegary and a little sweet)  #2   sesame green beens  (nutty and crunchy) and #3   some chicken custard dish which was incredibly interesting and totally delicious.  - it came in this little covered pot and was the consistency of pudding yet savory with flavors of chicken and a touch of orange.   wish i knew the name because it was fantastic! in short:  great food.  crappy lighting.  ideal for brunch or lunch.
Young r.}Chicago, IL}2}36}2}-1}4}1/30/2011}4.5 STAR.  I strongly recommend this place.  All the small dishes and soba were excellent!  The only complaint is their sake selection and high price for the portion.  We ordered several carafe, and it was really small - you should see the shape of the carafe... ugh.Other than that, we really enjoyed the meal.  The service was very good, and food was delivered fast.  Kamo tsukune was very yummy!  I generally cannot stand duck, mostly because of smell, but this one was delish.  Uni Tororo was very good, and kabocha was just excellent!  When I had Kanpachi sashimi, I was confused for a sec whether I were sitting in a sushiya.  It was that good.  Winter is the best time to enjoy kanpachi, but it was one of the best I've had in the US.  Really pleasantly surprised.  Oh, don't forget to try their ankimo.  When the dish was delivered, I thought they must have bought ready-to-serve frozen ankimo from supermaket, but hell no!  It cannot be fresh (never frozen), but it tasted like fresh and the sauce was not overpowering.  Soba was good, but I should've ordered zaru, not soba in hot soup... I forgot that I never liked soup soba.  =(  Overall, I strongly recommend this place.  This is certainly not the best Japanese place I've been to, but a place that I would love to go back many times more.  ** Dear Owner, don't be so stingy on sake. ;-) **
Issa M.}Laguna Hills, CA}1}35}1}-1}4}1/28/2011}Good food, great presentation, good service.  The place is casual but nice.  I had the duck soba, which was good.  Portions are reasonable, not huge.  The shumai is very good.  For adventure, try the honey wasabe ice cream.
William P.}San Francisco, CA}6}15}0}-1}3}1/27/2011}A little pricey for what you get, but their soba is authentic and amazing on a chilly night. Tastes good, but the downside is that I'm always hungry 2 hours later. What can I say, I'm a fatty.
April L.}Clayton, CA}16}95}30}-1}5}1/25/2011}The best tasting hot vegetarian soba noodle soup ever! I can't believe the clean goodness of this soup. I almost finished the whole bowl and that bowl is pretty  big. It was so comforting to come in out of the New York winter cold and into this establishment.  I wish it wasn't just in New York because this would be so nice to have around the corner in the Bay Area.  Now,  what am I gonna do when I crave soba soup??? I guess fly across country..haha..gotta satisfy the craving!!!
Sean K.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}1287}212}1682}-1}2}1/24/2011}I ordered the lunch box, not exactly the best deal for $17. I could do a lot better for a lot less in this neighborhood.The Udon noodle soup was great, but everything else was pretty damn bad. The salmon was VERY dry, and the vegetables, as well. The shrimp tempura was also very good. I would come back here for some soup and tempura, but that's about it.Also, the servers are not too keen on their English, but they get the job done. The price is steep, the food is good at points, terrible at other. I probably won't be going back to Soba-ya.
Adam B.}Great Neck, NY}12}33}0}-1}4}1/23/2011}Good service, good food and no lines!  I have always been more partial to soba, so to be fair, I might be a bit...biased.  I rather like their hot soba noodle soup dishes, especially the one served with duck and scallions.  While not terribly complicated, it is a good warming dish for a winter day.  Their offerings are varied enough and well priced during lunch and they have some interestingly varied beer selections (try the buckwheat beer at least once).  Overall, this restaurant can be relied on to please with decent service and consistently good food, just so long as you like soba.
Cici T.}San Francisco, CA}272}443}397}18}4}1/16/2011}I've transformed from an udon to a soba lover. What got me in the door was that Soba-ya's soba is homemade. Otherwise I would just make my own soba at home by sprinkling some nori with black sesame seeds on cold buckwheat noodles with a splash of sweetened soy sauce. Simple and satisfying.The restaurant itself is clean, but the ambiance is otherwise not particularly remarkable. The tables and seats are a yellow-toned wood, meant to conjure a similar texture as bamboo. It looks like a standard Japanese restaurant.For dinner, my party of 3 shared the Moriawase, with our choice of three vegetables. Our selections were the gobo (mountain burdock), the lotus root, and the satsuma imo (marinated sweet potato). The gobo, sauteed with carrots, and the sliced lotus root were refreshing appetizers that didn't weigh us down before our noodles were served. The sweet potato was marinated in a sweet and savory sauce, more sweet than savory, with the starch fully digested by the marinade such that the potato had a pasty consistency. We also had the sukui tofu, a chilled tofu with shavings of dried fish and served with wasabi and a soy based sauce. The tofu was fresh, but not special.Appetizers were followed with a hot tempura soba with shrimp, shiso, and shishito tempura and a cold soba salad with chewy noodles mixed with mesclun salad, seaweed, and slices of cherry tomatoes with two sauces, a sesame soy sauce and a creamier white sauce.The tempura had a light batter. The shrimp was a pretty pink and had great texture, which was indicative of its freshness. I found the soba broth to be average, although my friend really enjoyed it. I personally preferred the cold soba, which highlighted the bouncy buckwheat noodles whose chewy integrity was maintained throughout our meal. The hot soba, on the otherhand, had absorbed much of the soup and was no longer doughy but rather soft.Last but not least, the price is right. Wallet friendly.I will be back for lunch! I want the lunch box. And after that, I want to try the seasonal offerings of their soba.
Ally K.}Manhattan, NY}22}115}4}-1}4}1/16/2011}A rare gem tucked away in the East Village.  The lunch box here is PHENOMENAL: Cold, refreshing, soba noodles; tender grilled salmon; crispy vegetable tempura; sliced cucumbers; assorted vegetables; delicious inari, and a mixed green salad...  All followed by a sweet (but not too sweet) Japanese custard.  And all for just $15!
Tomi Y.}Seattle, WA}0}15}0}-1}3}1/14/2011}This place was opened on the Christmas day! That was awesome. This place has a nice decor and the the service was good. As the name suggested, soba-ya has tons of noodle options and they were awesome. I had their Udon soup (as part of their lunch set) and it was tasty. On the other hand, their non-noodle dishes don't taste as good. You can find out more about my specific order on my blog: ricendine.com/2011/01/me…
Stephanie Y.}San Francisco, CA}150}625}27}-1}4}1/5/2011}Cute little place for lunch!! I love watching the guy making the soba noodles. He's so smooth and quick. The waiters are also attentive and quick. I ordered the tempura eel hot soba noodle. I was a little sad they put the tempura in the soup, so it was all soggy and it was hard to pick up with my chopsticks. I did improve my chopstick skills and was able to pick up the soggy eel without breaking it towards the end of lunch. The soba noodles were al dente enough and each noodle was the perfect length to slurp. The broth was a little sour for me though.My boyfriend ordered the duck hot soba noodle and that was also delicious.I would like to come back and order the udon noodles next time.
Ceda X.}Los Angeles, CA}81}40}0}-1}4}1/4/2011}The udon I ordered had such a deep flavorful broth that wasn't over salty. The noodles had a great texture and I love the tight squeeze of this little restaurant. Excellent casual food.
James S.}Manhattan, NY}18}211}1}-1}5}12/29/2010}Solid 4 stars. Yay! I'm a fan. We ordered the hot soba noodles with tempura. The broth of the soup was amazing!! It kinda has this wood smoked flavor to it, I've never had soup with this flavor before! It was delicious! The noodles were great as well, with good texture.The seating arrangement is pretty crunched into together so you better hope you have good conversation or else you will be entertained by your neighbor. Aside from the smoking hot Korean waitress, serve was decent but not memorable. Prices are pretty much typical of Manhattan, about $18/each for the soba noodles. Will definitely be back here again in the future.
Eric K.}New York, NY}62}159}26}-1}3}12/27/2010}It's difficult to judge a place when you're not the biggest fan of its signature dish.  Since I was young, I've had soba at home, at the mitsuwa food court, and at various japanese restaurants yet no soba dish has ever really hit a chord. While I haven't been to Japan, I hoped that Soba-ya, one of the more respected soba houses in NY could change that.  After a couple visits, I'm still questing for a soba epiphany.The kamo namban i.e the hot soba with sauteed duck and green onion was pretty good.  Floating in the hot broth were several delicious slices of duck that were giving the soup a richness and meatiness that it sorely needed.  Altogether, it may have come closest to its $16 price tag. Meanwhile, the "chicken" curry hot soba was nowhere near its $16.  Soba was drowned in a japanese curry stew that had 4 or 5 dime-sized dry and flavorless pieces of chicken that were hidden somewhere. A really disappointing dish.  The age-dashi tofu appetizer is okay but the best bite and value on the menu may be the dessert: 3 scoops of very interesting ice cream flavors for $6.  We tried the black sesame, yuzu, and honey-wasabi flavors, but I wish all scoops had been the strangely addicting honey-wasabi.  Since Soba-ya doesn't take reservations, if you don't get there early for dinner, you'll join the huddled groups squeezing in the tiny waiting area.  Thankfully, the hostess takes down phone numbers so that you can get a quick beer on st. marks or drink at cha-an teahouse, which is across the street. However, unless you're a soba aficionado, it's not worth it...Soba-ya is one of those places where you get the check and wonder how you spent so much and yet remember so little about the meal you just ate. I will say though that soba-ya does have some really good-looking lunch and early bird specials.
Sallina Y.}Queens, NY}12}91}271}-1}3}12/26/2010}I tried some of my friend's sauteed burdock roots (yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…), which tasted really healthy... but not in a bad way.Given the name, I just had to try the soba, so I ordered the curry soba (yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…)  with pieces of chicken in it .. The chicken was dry and there were probably only 5 pieces in all. but the soba was very filling and delicious. The curry was very flavorful. We had the matcha crulee (yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…) for dessert, and it was great, but really.. you'd have to be REALLY bad to screwup green tea crème brulee. The best green tea crème brulee I've ever had was still at Bozu though...  Anyway, if you love soba/udon, this is a great spot.Also, the green tea here is one of the best I've had in a restaurant.
Ellen C.}Seattle, WA}693}1007}120}18}3}12/26/2010}My friend Kiki had taken us here because she said that the uni soba was to die for. I love uni, and I love soba, so the 2 combined was really just a brilliant concept I had never heard of.I'm thinking that this dish is even better during summer because it's such a cool dish, however I wasn't disappointed. I prefer my uni on rice because I feel that it really magnifies the flavor of the uni.
Selena L.}West Hollywood, CA}362}158}8}-1}4}12/25/2010}this is the sort of place you go to if you're seeking out something a bit different, be it monkfish liver or milt. personally, i'm a huge fan of ankimo (the former) but many people find it unappealing because of the heavy, fishy flavor. fish sperm, the latter um, i'll probably give it a go if you don't tell me what it is.anyway, handmade soba and udon is what makes this place a real hit. when it's summer and i'm here, i get a cold soup dish and a double order of the housemade udon because it's chewy & refreshing. sure, i'm small, but i can pack in a lot of food. this is because of my hollow leg*.service can be slow, especially when crowded at peak dinner hours but the staff is sweet. oh, be sure to get the boiled spinach mixed with miso - it's the cure for whatever ails you.*i don't really have a hollow leg, though i did go to stuyvesant, home of the peglegs.
Mike S.}New York, NY}1}246}0}-1}3}12/25/2010}I think this place is a little overpriced and better ramen can be found. On the other hand maybe it's what I had: noodles with a ton of fish sperm, like as if 5+ big, virile fish had just spawned in my bowl or something.  I'm not really into that stuff but admittedly it was pretty fresh. For those of you who are into that, I can highly recommend this restaurant. Unfortunately I don't know the Japanese words for fish sperm so my apologies. Bon appetite/oyshi-des!
Pam L.}Fort Lee, NJ}29}37}102}-1}3}12/23/2010}Came here originally for Soba-ya's handmade soba noodles, but ended up falling in love with their tuna tartar and mountain yam (with uni, wasabi, and shredded nori). Since it was a cold night, we decided to go for the Kamo Namban Soba: a hot dish that is topped with sautéed duck & green onion. The soba was only ok; and the duck meat was rather difficult to chew. I wasn't too impressed. I think the hot soup made the noodles softer, and I'd much prefer to have my soba al dente. I'd recommend ordering from the cold menu next time as that is what they are known for. Our Tuna Tartar on the other hand, was great as it had two of my favorite ingredients sandwiched in between the fresh tuna: mountain yam and avocado! Not everyone enjoyed the pairing of the tuna tartar, but I personally liked how the three ingredients mushed together. It was flavorful, but not overpowering. Our other appetizer, Uni Tororo Sea Urchin & grated Mountain Yam was another light and flavorful dish. In Japanese cuisine, mountain yam is usually eaten raw and grated - the texture is sticky and slimy. Mountain yam is also considered to be one of the most important and commonly used Chinese herb and medicine repertoire. Although I am personally not a big fan of uni, I loved the taste of uni and mountain yam together. The strong taste of the uni was balanced by the lightness of the mountain yam - a perfect combo!Since we had grabbed street food earlier, we didn't have enough stomach room for dessert. I completely regret this as I heard they had some pretty unique desserts available (including homemade ice-cream).
Jennifer N.}New York, NY}9}69}0}-1}4}12/22/2010}After trying practically most of the restaurants in the St. Marks area, we decided to try something new and check out Soba-Ya which I'd been avoiding.  Mostly because I didn't consider myself to be a fan of soba.  After waiting for about 20 minutes we were seated and promptly served with a hot towel to clean our hands.  I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon served in a pot with shrimp tempura, chicken, egg, fish cake, mushrooms, and some small vegetables.  The broth was savory and tasty and the noodles were just right.  My partner ordered the cold soba Zaru which he enjoyed and was satisfied with.  He also thought my udon dish was one of the best he's had.We also ordered a Gindara yuzu infused soy cured cod fish to share which I found to be absolutely delicious.  It had great texture and the flavors were mixed well.I like the green tea they serve and the staff is super attentive - they replenish your tea often and provide napkins as needed.Ambiance was good, very relaxed, easy to have a conversation, and allows for the opportunity to bond with your dining partner(s).There is also a bag check option if you are lugging around a lot of stuff with you or have a large parcel.
Sandy J.}Alexandria, VA}247}259}300}-1}5}12/21/2010}Love this place.  Delicious soba (cold & hot), nice decor, and great service...what more could you ask for.  My only complaint is that it is a bit on the pricey side.
Makiko O.}New York, NY}10}33}1}-1}5}12/18/2010}This is my go-to place when I want affordable Japanese food without compromising on quality. Their signature soba is freshly made on premises with buckwheat imported from Japan. Just make sure to arrive early for dinner on weekends, otherwise you'd end up waiting for a while.
Jess L.}New Haven, CT}3187}4108}2861}18}3}12/16/2010}Very cute and classy spot for delectable - but expensive - Japanese food. I really was hoping they'd have a lunch deal, but all dishes were around $13. For soup! Granted, the soup was good. And the service was great. The ambiance is very chill and, well, Japanese. A gourmet experience, but I was left feeling the hole in my wallet for the quantity and quality.
Burry B.}San Diego, CA}269}214}272}-1}4}12/15/2010}soba-ya is a great place.  friendly staff and, oh man hand made and cut fresh soba noodles.  i have to tell you that i am still a soba amateur and although the soba noodles are the best i've ever had, the additions are very light and mild in flavor from what i've grown accompanied to.  i still have a lot to learn about soba, but hands down the soba noodles here have been second to none of all the places i've had soba.  the prices are a tad pricey here, but if you like soba it is quite an experience here.  i can't wait to come back for seconds.
Yad L.}San Francisco, CA}211}362}450}18}3}12/13/2010}Didn't care for their "Don" at all. Their soba dishes were distinct  with very flavorful broth and stood out a whole lot more.
Timofei G.}New York, NY}25}23}0}-1}4}12/11/2010}With its low ceilings and bamboo-heavy Japanese decor, this restaurant manages to be intimate in a good way, leaving you free to enjoy your soba or your conversation with few distractions.  It is quiet but not romantic, making it good for a casual date, meeting a friend, or dinner out with family (we saw one with a 10-year-old child).The main attractions are hot noodle soup and cold noodle salad, with either udon or soba.   Also, there is a variety of uniquely Japanese appetizers and desserts availble that will make you think "wow, I've never seen this menu item before."They do not accept reservations, so on weekends, try to get there before 6pm or risk waiting in line until a table opens up.Get a clear soup, such as Noodle Soup with Duck and Scallions.  Don't make the mistake I did and get the noodle soup with curry chicken, unless you know exactly what it is (a large bowl of spicy, thick, and creamy curry that I found unappetizing).The service compared favorably with "noodle shops" in the area.  We were handed hot towels for our hands, and our soup bowls were arranged on stylish wooden trays in a specific orientation, with chopsticks on the left and napkin on the right.All in all, a classier alternative to Setagaya, Menkui-Tei, and the like.
Coty S.}Saint Petersburg, FL}1931}1471}3797}18}3}12/11/2010}I came here for my Birthday hoping for something special.  It was just some overpriced bland noodles.  No one else was really enjoying themselves either.  It seems that the best deal is to order one of the sets to try many different dishes.  It was so hot in here that I was very uncomfortable the entire time.  The hot soup was not helping either.We were subjected to the normal Manhattan young couple next to us on a date.  Which are skinny and overly privileged people that just talk about themselves and how difficult their amazing advertising jobs are.  It made me want to vomit.  I find myself having to listen to these types of overpaid loud people with valley accents at the more trendy Japanese restaurants in the area.  The last one being Ippudo.
Jay W.}Markham, Canada}0}120}102}-1}4}12/11/2010}Been looking for a great soba place since experiencing Yabu Soba in Tokyo! Soba-ya hit the spot with their cold soba noodles. The noodles are handmade and were the right texture. Not too chewy or soft.The atmosphere of Soba-ya is really calm and they ask you to turn off your cell phones.... so you can hear the other patrons slurping their noodles I guess?Anyways, what I really enjoyed was at the end of the meal, they bring out a little tea pot containing some of the water that the soba was boiled in. You dump your remaining soba sauce in there and drink the concoction like a soup! Sounds weird but it was really tasty and it was the perfect way to end the meal.
Puna K.}Washington, DC}86}91}149}-1}4}12/9/2010}Delicious soba noodles and broth, perfectly fried agemono dishes and fresh sashimi, nice selection of side dishes, and great service, everything is really spot on except for the price. Expect to spend more than you want for soba noodles.
Mai Y.}Queens, NY}216}116}26}-1}4}12/8/2010}Authentic soba places are always a plus. I would definitely go again, but most likely on a special occasion of something. personally, i like ramen better than soba so i would rather go get a good bowl of ramen. kinda pricey, but you pay for the authentic ambiance, food and great service.
Rita R.}New York, NY}0}13}75}-1}2}12/5/2010}Food is fine, but it's pricy for taking a lunch that you might get something even better for dinner at a comparable price range.  We spend $74 for a lunch  for two which I believe the food is far off the price.  I can't tell much different between freshly made soba and precook one, if I do need to spend that amout of money for lunch, I would go something else in the area close by.
Z S.}New York, NY}4}6}1}-1}5}11/28/2010}I crave this joint on a regular basis.  Let me put it simply . . . if I could eat the Uni Soba (with Tororo) at least once a week, I would consider life a whole lot sweeter.The staff is great, the handmade noodles are delicious and comforting (whether hot or cold), the duck appetizer is pretty spectacular, they have a decent sake selection (though slightly overpriced), and though I want folks to appreciate this place, I am afraid of watching it get more and more popular all the time.And on a random note, ladies, you will get a kick out of the heated toilet seat.  I know I did.
Matthew C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}18}0}-1}5}11/25/2010}Service was very attentive and friendly. For instance, they offered us hot tea during our short wait for a table, and then proceeded to refill our cups liberally and without prompting during our meal.My Singaporean friend and I both had cold soba (I had the duck, he had the uni) and we both thought it was amazing and authentic. My friend also had a sashimi bowl (a bargain at $11) with warm sushi rice, which is a nice touch.They also offer good Soba water, which can be hard to come by.The Wasabi ice cream was great.Definitely stopping by again sometime. Go to Cha-an across the street for desert and tea after if you want a full Japanese overload. :D
Amy S.}Astoria, NY}272}308}2473}-1}4}11/11/2010}Chilly weather calls for soup noodles and the recent onslaught of cold weather gave me a chance to cross Soba-ya off my list of restaurants to try. Soba is the underrated Japanese noodle. Ramen has gotten a lot of attention in NYC for good reason; the rich heavy broth, springy noodles, and thick slices of tender pork make for a hearty meal. But I think it's about time soba had it's turn in the limelight. It may not pack as big of a punch as ramen, but simplicity and subtlety has it's place in the food world too. I was hoping for a light but satisfying meal and Soba-ya did not disappoint.For appetizers, our group of four shared...SALMON SASHIMI - This was surprisingly high-quality for a soba place and I love that they gave thick slices of salmon BUT $9 for 6 slices of fish is a little on the pricey side.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…TUNA TARTAR with chopped japanese yam & avocado - Beautiful presentation but the texture of the tuna was sacrificed for the presentation. I would have preferred if they chopped the tuna instead of mushing it together.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…For my entrée I had...KINOKO SOBA sautéed duck & mushroom (hot) - This is the Saturday selection from Soba-ya's seasonal menu. Oh man, the seared duck slices are so fatty and tender. But why did I only get two slices? *sad face* My friends who ordered the Kamo Seiro and Kamo Namban each had at least five slices of seared duck. I suppose the focus of my soba was the mushrooms. There were plentiful amounts of enoki, shitake, and shimeji mushrooms that added texturally to each bite of noodles. The mushrooms also gave the already-savory broth an additional nuttiness that I really like. I appreciate Soba-ya's attention to detail, like the chopped scallions they give you on the side and the orange zest they add to the broth.yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…The rest of the group had...YASAI SOBA mixed vegetables & mushrooms (hot)yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…KAMO NAMBAN SOBA sautéed duck & green onion (hot)yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…KAMO SEIRO SOBA duck slice & green onion in hot dipping sauce (cold)yelp.com/biz_photos/i8ej…$12-20 for a bowl of soup noodles is pricey, but you're paying for the quality of the ingredients. The broth isn't overpowering which allows all the ingredients to shine. The homemade soba noodles are really firm and fresh. I recommend ordering from the cold soba menu if you tend to like your noodles al dente and from the hot soba menu if you tend to like your noodles softer. You can also order udon instead of soba. Overall, yummy noodles and friendly, attentive service. I'll be back!
Olivia W.}Manhattan, NY}15}19}1}-1}5}11/3/2010}THE most delicious soba I have ever had! But to be honest, I haven't eaten a whole lot in my lifetime.  I had the Tuesday special with Sardines.  The broth was perfectly seasoned, complex with a lot of depth in flavor.  Big meaty chunks of fresh sardines.  So yummy, I finished every drop. Service was very attentive and polite, just fine.  Perk- Japanese toilet complete with heated seat and front and back washing system :)
Vivian Y.}Brooklyn, NY}42}124}125}18}3}10/30/2010}Came here for lunch for my boyf's birthday. I didn't get soba but he did and he said it was mediocre, nothing too crazy. I got the lunch set chicken katsu-don with udon. It was nothing special. The ambiance was good though and the service was alright.
Christopher L.}San Francisco, CA}382}627}14}-1}3}10/30/2010}They make their own sobathe uni soba dish wasn't bad, but i wouldn't get it again
amy s.}Brooklyn, NY}13}56}2}-1}5}10/29/2010}This is perhaps my overall favorite restaurant anywhere in the world. It took me a while to decide that's a true statement, but I am confident of it. Soba-ya is the one restaurant that were it ever, heavens forbid, to close, my soul quite literally might perish. Been a regular here for over 10 years and I have never, I repeat never had a bad experience. (Please, food gods of the universe, don't let me have just jinxed it!)By now you've read that they make every noodle by hand, it's super authentic, etc. and that's all true. (Or so I imagine -- I'm totally not Japanese.)Additionally, the service is A+ always, every bite and sip is exactly right in every way, and the decor is filled with lovely understated things. Plus the toilet seats are heated! Seriously, it blows my mind every time I have a meal there, and yet, at the same time, it's so right and familiar and imperfect in tiny lovely ways that I hardly notice it's exceptional. It's like home, idealized.I almost always get kitsune soba. Yasai soba is also great. My husband goes in for a big boiling bowl of nabayake udon in the wintertime.I like to start with the 3 little dishes of vegetables, and chose lotus root, green beans with lip-smackingly good sesame sauce, and burdock or squash or edamame. As for standard Japanese restaurant elements, I have seaweed salad at nearly every Japanese place I go to, but I love Soba-ya's version beyond compare. Everyone serves compulsory after-dinner green tea, but I look forward to Soba-ya's tea. Red bean mochi is taken to new heights, tofu become a whole new food group, and tempura is nearly astringent it's so light and clean. Soba-ya serves astonishing every-day cuisine. I love it.
Sayuri R.}Las Vegas, NV}41}39}1}-1}5}10/27/2010}3 words: Sake Oyako Don. Raw Salmon on a bed of rice topped with Salmon Roe. Oh, yeah their soba is pretty darned good, but I seriously dream of this dish. Serious as a salmon swimming back to their birth stream to spawn.
J B.}Hicksville, NY}5}169}16}-1}4}10/25/2010}This food is good!  Yasai hot noodle soup is the best, and makes me feel good all over when I eat it.We always expect it to be packed, but then are surprised to find that there is no wait.  This happens every time.Most everything I have tried here is great, though there are a few things that taste a bit weird, perhaps because it's a little *too* authentic?  The most obvious example is the green tea ice cream, which is darker and has more tea flavor and less sugar than the green tea ice cream at other places I've been to.
Michael O.}Wantagh, NY}22}6}0}-1}5}10/24/2010}This place is always busy and jam packed with Japanese people.  By that alone, you know this place is super authentic and highly recommended!Can't say I've ever had anything bad here.  Obviously the soba is really good, but I always go here for their donburi (ricebowl) offerings.  Their chirashi (or mixed seafood) donburi is quite possibly one of the best I've ever had in my life.  They cut the fish into tiny cubes along with the veggies and everything else unlike the chirashi you'd get from other sushi places where it's like one thick cut of each type of fish.Everything is really quite good from their appetizers to even their unique dessert offerings.  It's all very tasty, authentic, and good!Service is super fast and everyone is quite nice.  The place is just always packed and in some parts it feels like you're seated with less than a foot between you and the other party next to you.  Definitely recommend getting a booth or a table in the center instead of by the wall if you can manage it.My only gripe about this place is that after ordering 3 courses and a soda or two, it can get pretty costly!  But the food is so good, and it's worth every penny if you ask me!
Chad T.}Manhattan, NY}51}724}127}18}4}10/18/2010}I can't say that I love the noodle soup here as much as I do at Momofuku Noodle Bar, but damn the pork belly is amazing.  Giant hunks of tender, fatty pork belly.  You can't go wrong... come give it a shot!
Andrew C.}New York, NY}29}60}0}-1}3}10/3/2010}Had the lunch box set.  Soba was good, but maybe a bit too salty in the hot broth.  Next time will try the cold to control the salt.
Linh D.}New York, NY}23}66}0}-1}4}9/27/2010}I went here last sunday for the first time in  3 years. I am shocked as to why I haven't been back more often! noodles are so fresh you can tell they were made in house. Must order their tofu. it's so smooth, like silk and so FRESH! I'm definitely coming back more often.
Yvonne W.}New York, NY}100}394}219}-1}4}9/25/2010}This place was recommended to me by a coworker who used to live in Japan, and she had told me that this was the only place in New York that served soba like the kind she had remembered in Tokyo. The buckwheat that Soba-ya uses to make the soba noodles is apparently imported from Japan, which is pretty cool and adds even more authenticity to this place. I had the soba with fried eel in soup, and I could definitely tell that they were much different than the kinds that I had previously had at other restaurants. The taste is definitely more wheaty. The texture is also different. Most of the noodle dishes are between $14-17, so while it's not a cheap eat, you know you are getting good quality. Soba-ya also has a pretty good variety of sakes on the menu to choose from. I can't remember which one my friend and I had, but it was subtly sweet and went well with the soba noodles. We ended our meal with dessert -  a tofu dessert with fruit and mango pudding topped with fruit and whipped cream. The tofu dessert was soft, silky, and perfectly sweetened, while the mango pudding was amazing - it was definitely homemade and made with real mangoes, as it tasted just like ones I had made before. No boxed mix here! This is a great place to go if you are craving noodles, sake, and some great dessert. Service is very attentive, and the seating (in my opinion) was pretty spacious. I definitely felt like the restaurant looked pretty traditional.
Ellen M.}Brooklyn, NY}64}41}35}-1}4}9/23/2010}I'm writing a long overdue review of my regular soba place.  I always take advantage of their special set menu.  For lunch, I always order their lunch box which comes with choice of noodle, salad, tempura, nimono (cooked mountain veggies and chicken), inari sushi, Japanese style egg omelette and grilled salmon.  I also like their salmon oyako don.  Fresh salmon sashimi & salmon eggs on top of sushi rice, mmm~  For dinner, get there early (before 7) to grab their early bird special.  It's a 3 course meal which comes with appetizer set,  main course (soba or udon, tempura & inari sushi) and dessert.Both their handmade soba and udon are great either hot or cold, and service is consistently attentive.  This is my favorite noodle place in NYC, and is comparable to my West Coast favorite, Sanuki no Sato in Gardena, CA.
Ginny L.}New York, NY}51}371}35}-1}4}9/13/2010}After i went food shopping, my friend and i decided to visit Sobaya for lunch because i really like Soba, and its healthy for you!! So when my friend and i walked in, the waittress was really kind and asked if i would like them to hold my stuff. It was very kind for them to offer, and i did had too many bags on my hand. After we got settled, we looked through the menu.I decided to have Soba with Uni (Cold), and my friend had her Soba with vegetables(Warm)...when we got our dish, i was very pleased. I really wanted to try how uni and soba tasted together, both have a weird taste!! The noodles were really good, and the Uni was fresh, after finishing my dish, the waittress brought over a small container with soup inside, i poured the soup into my left order sauce that were left from eating the soba, the soup and the sauce worked really well together and i really liked it.As for Dessert, we ordered the trio ice cream - Yuzu, sesame, and wasabi flavor icream.....The yuzu was really refreshing, i really like the smell and the taste, the sesame was excellent, and it went well with the fried noodles that they were serving with the ice creams, as for the wasabi...it was really weird...i really like wasabi, so i didnt find it hard to handle, but the aftertaste does do you wonders.....but definitely a must try when you visit.
Sarah C.}San Francisco, CA}84}251}0}-1}5}9/9/2010}This place is my savior for chilly nights in the East Village and good eats.  (Chilly nights - November-February). Its a perfect place to grub, see old friends and feel completely satisfied.  I love their soba.  I don't think I can pass this place without envisioning the aroma of spices and fond memories of the my youth.
Taka A.}Clifton, NJ}39}50}2}-1}4}8/24/2010}The place is great for soba, if you can't make a bowl of this at home yourself.  I appreciate the handmade noodle, the presentation and all but the prices are a bit steep here.  I still gave it 4 stars because the food is good and complaining about prices in nyc is like complaining about bad drivers...it just kinda comes with the territory. I think on Sat or Sun morning after a night of drinking, this place hits the spot.  Its a change of pace from the usual hangover/brunch spots and equally priced if you think about it.All in all a good experience if you can appreciate the subtle awesomeness of Japanese cuisine (aka you don't need mayo in your sushi to enjoy it!)Also, this might be bit catty but 10-15% tip is cheap...15%-20% is normal.  (I don't condone a waiter chasing after a few bucks but don't write how cheap you are without realizing these things)
E G.}New York, NY}0}17}0}-1}4}8/9/2010}Expensive for soba, but this is the place to eat it if you have a hungering for some noodles that aren't ramen. This is my most trusted restaurant when I want a cold dinner on a hot day. Get the cold soba with duck, it hits the spot and they do it right. Skip the appetizers, they're hit or miss.
Reyna A.}Washington, DC}43}69}3}-1}4}8/1/2010}Came for lunch on Sunday at 12 noon when the restaurant opens. Didn't take long for the place to fill up. Seemed like regular customers were the patrons which was a good sign.  Had the cold soba lunch box and it was excellent. Living in DC now  which to my dismay is a soba desert. Soba-ya is tasty, with excellent service and good vibe.  Enjoyed being able to converse with my lunchmate while Jao Gilberto was playing softly in the background. And the Japanese-style toilet in the WC was a fun touch. Def look forward to returning to Soba-ya, for the food, not for the bathroom.
Lawrence C.}New York, NY}82}215}0}-1}4}7/28/2010}I've written at length before about soba in my review of the nearby SobaKoh, so I'll be brief here: it's a subtle pleasure, more heavily dependent on an appreciation of texture than, say, ramen.Soba-ya is more... how can I say it... cinematically Japanese than SobaKoh. By that, I mean that its blonde wood and layout more immediately call stereotypically authentic Japanese restaurants to mind. It's lit somewhat more romantically as well, so it may be a better spot for a date. (Unsurprising, given that its owners also run Sakagura.)I ordered some "yuba sashimi" to start. Here, yuba, the ethereal papyrus byproduct of tofu production, was wrapped around its parent tofu, to lovely and cooling effect. Expensive for the portion size, and not anything I'd recommend to anyone besides, uh, me, but I'd order it again in a heartbeat.Then, the main event: I went with a seasonal "Sansai soba" special involving cold soba and a clump of hard-to-identify vegetables. There were slivers of mushrooms in there, perhaps some daikon sprouts, green onions. All were delicious, recalling a dewy morning on a mountainside. (Yes, I really just wrote that. Please... if you see me on the street... Kick my ass.)But the soba itself was a little disappointing. The springy-slippery mouth feel was right, but the flavor was a touch bland. SobaKoh's raw product is much more redolent of its buckwheat origins. The dipping sauce, on the other hand, was off the hook. It had a bit of smokiness to it that was pure intoxication. That little moment at the end of a serious soba meal where you're given the still-hot noodle cooking liquid to mix with the sauce, then you drink it up? Absolute bliss here.If only SobaKoh and Soba-ya could join forces... They could raze Soba Totto, go toe to toe with Matsugen, perhaps even erase some people's memories of Honmura An. 'Tis not to be, I suppose. As it is, the decision between SobaKoh and Soba-ya is a near tossup. I guess I'd direct most people, for whom less buckwheatiness might not be such a bad thing, to Soba-ya, and reserve SobaKoh for hardcore enthusiasts (kind of like my Kyo Ya/Soto dichotomy). But really, you should go try both. And you should invite me along.Probability of return within 1 year: 40%
Keith E.}New York, NY}6}21}0}-1}2}7/26/2010}It was alright.The place was clean, service was good, but the food wasn't anything special. Prices seemed a bit high for what you're getting, so I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
GC N.}Chicago, IL}2}34}38}-1}4}7/24/2010}Consistently excellent soba with reasonable prices. We recently had duck soba (hot) and the burdock root and soft shell crab appetizers. Everything was prepared with care and precision. The soft shell crab was the biggest surprise of the night.  It was lightly fried, moist, and tasted delicious.
L C.}San Francisco, CA}4}44}0}-1}5}7/20/2010}I took my mom here for her birthday- hot day, cold noodles sounded good.  I got the recommendation from a coworker, but i had my reservations since there are some so-so reviews on yelp.We got there early enough for the early bird special.  We both ordered it.  And i have to say, it was really fantastic and a great deal!  an appetizer plate with small, tasty appetizers, shrimp and vegetable tempura, inarizuchi and cold soba.  Everything was delicious, we both cleared our plates.  And this was followed by green tea and vanilla icecream topped with a fresh strawberry!  The presentation was fantastic, the staff was friendly, and the food was excellent.  The ambiance is also quiet and cool.  I can't wait to go back to this place!
Erina N.}San Diego, CA}30}32}21}-1}1}7/15/2010}I am Japanese came from Japan, but I'm living in the US for ten years so far. OK, My friend who live in NY took me and my husband to this restaurant when we visited her. First, we were super surprised how EXPENSIVE their food were. Too Overpriced for noodles even they make it there. You can get better hand-made noodle in LA way cheaper than here. (I understand NY is expensive, but still it's way too overpriced) I was excited about their taste of food since I am paying $20 or more for lunch noodles and small rice bowl. It was ALRIGHT, soup was too salty and taste too much dashi (fish flavor). I ordered cold Udon noodle, i wasn't amazed at all. After we finished our food, our waitress(she wasn't Japanese) ask for check so we told her to make 2 separate checks. We paid by Credit Card with separate tips. Then, the waitress came to us when we are leaving, she told me to give her more tip. She even said that "usually people give 18~20% tip". Excuse me? I used to work at the restaurant in US. I know what the hell I'm doing. We put at least 10~15%. She didn't do anything except taking order and bring us check, everything else was done by somebody else. So, I gave her $1 more tip as she wanted, then we left. My husband was so angry what she actually asked customer more tip -- I have never experienced this before in my US life. I would give her more if she deserved it. It was awful experience after meal, and we were all mad about this happen. Even my friend doesn't want to go back here again. My opinion: You can find a lot better food, price and customer service in other Japanese restaurants in NY.
Catherine S.}Atlanta, GA}113}197}1222}-1}5}7/11/2010}The best soba noodles in NYC and the best i've ever eaten.  Period.Experience:We came in with reservations on a weekend night and we seated without a wait.  Drinks were served quickly and ordering was simple.Drinks:Yuzu and pear sake cocktails were superb!Appetizers:I wanted to try everything I saw all the other tables enjoying.  What we ordered:  sesame tofu, uni tororo, and ika meshi (squid stuffed with sticky rice).  All 3 were distinctly flavored and very tasty.Entrees:Kinoko sauteed duck & mushroom (hot) and the soba salad (cold).The broth in the kinoko was amazing - not overly salted but incredibly savory.  The soba salad came with two dressings that you mix to taste - greens very fresh and toppings perfectly complimented the noodles.Dessert:While very full on the dinner already, we couldn't leave without trying some homemade icecreams:  green tea (heavy on the tea) and wasabi honey (fantastic!).
Yuki C.}New York, NY}75}19}1}-1}5}7/10/2010}If you haven't had handmade soba (buckwheat noodle), this is the place to go! It's quite a learning experience to follow the proper steps, ask the staff for instructions when it's not overtly crowded. BTW, cold soba is a great choice for the steamy summer and it's very healthy ^^If you are looking for authentic Chirashi, this hidden gem might be one of the few places in NYC that does it right! Don't miss the rice dishes there, they are equally delicious.
Jeff C.}Laurel, MD}15}94}0}-1}1}7/6/2010}This place is quite packed.  You can get quite comfy and cozy with your next table diners.  Not been back at this place due to rudeness of the waitstaff for the last year or two, we decided to try our luck again.  While enjoying our neighbor's conversation, we ordered hot tea.  The tea came back with something hanging on the wall of the cup.  I looked and it didn't look like a tea bag.  So I touched it, then pulled on them only to find that there are two pieces of preserved ginger hanging on the inside of the tea cup.  Now mind you, we havn't gotten our food yet, so these two pieces of ginger were...leftover from someone else's meal, went through the dishwasher, hung on the inside of the tea cup without the waiter or anyone else noticing, and made it to my table.  Imagine, the taste of another diner's leftover, saliva mixed with dishwashing detergent and a little bit of that nice green tea.  Wish I would have taken a picture of it just to show the department of health.  I don't mind a little hair in my food.  That's okay.  But food left from other people's meal making it to the inside of my teacup is not cool.  Yes, I realized I am no longer a college student and expect a little more out of my restaurants. Sometimes you just gotta graduate to a better place.  There goes the meal.
Muppet A.}New York, NY}48}82}5}-1}4}6/30/2010}Hot Duck Broth and Cold Soba Noodles = Match Made in HeavenThe complex broth / fatty succulent pieces of duck are the perfect complement to the fresh buckwheat noodles made in house. Tempura was spot on. Tuna / tofu skin roll was original. We sat at the bar ogling at the giant bowls of prepared foods. I definitely would have ordered the vegetable appetizer trio if I could have found room. May just have to swipe those extra long chopsticks and steal some mountain yams when no one is looking...
Denise Y.}Cleveland, OH}48}130}0}-1}5}6/22/2010}This place has some of the best soba that i've ever had, and it definitely hit the spot after a long day walking around the Met. We started off with a homemade tofu wrapped in tofu skin appetizer, while petite in size was refreshing and delicious on such a hot day. We ordered hot soba bowls, I got the seared duck and my brother got the broiled mackerel, and we were not disappointed. I only wished that I had gotten the large bowl ($3+) because the homemade noodles were so good! This place is definitely quality but I would knock it down half a star if only for the portion/price difference, smaller than what would fill me up on a cooler day.
Joyce B.}Nuremberg, Germany}309}474}39}-1}4}6/12/2010}definitely very authentic japanese food here. its a given that you should try their soba since they're named soba-ya. i ordered the cold soba with tempura eel and grated radish. since i've never actually ordered soba before, it was quite an interesting experience. my food came with the cooked soba, tempura eel, and grated radish in one bowl, the soup in a pot, and a small plate with green onions and wasabi. not completely sure what i should do, i just mixed the soup with everything inside the bowl. the texture and taste were interesting because the tempura gave a slightly sweet flavor and the radish enhanced the texture of the meal. i couldn't taste the wasabi in my soup. i was amazed at how all of these components mixed together brought out the best of each ingredient. in the end, they gave me the warm soup leftover from cooking the noodle to pour over the bowl to make it into a soup.
Vanessa S.}Seattle, WA}983}572}739}18}4}6/8/2010}Amazing place I couldnt have asked for better soba noodles ever! I came here on a friend recommendation and was pretty happy with the results. The service was great, the good amazing and the prices were perfect! Even the sake was a good price too...! The more the reason why you should come with a group of pals!
Kayo B.}Austin, TX}24}15}0}-1}5}6/8/2010}I was extremely happy to find this place. It's very authentic. It's pure, no BS, straight up good Japanese soba!Japanese take very serious with noodles in general, but this place lives up to the standard. You can order simple Zaru-soba or Yamakake-soba, cold soba with grated mountain yam(which is my favorite).  It's all wonderful. This place is not for everyone, but if you want to try something new with authentic Japanese foods, I highly recommend it.If you don't care for soba, you can order great tempura meal as well. My ultimate favorite entree other than soba is their tuna steak!!  It's been a while since I ate there, but I still dream about their tuna steak!!this place makes buckwheat noodle very exciting!! Great service, great locations!!It really looks like Soba-noodle place in Japan too.Next visit to NY, I will definitely go there..
Tiffany L.}New York, NY}121}1085}2}18}3}6/7/2010}2 of my girlfriends and i came here this past saturday - cold noodles sounded delicious in the midst of the heat and humidity. i loved the decor and the hum of activity. we kicked off the meal with Tuna Yuba-Maki (chopped tuna wrapped with yuba raw bean curd on top of avocado sauce). this was different and delicious! we followed up with their 3 most popular cold soba dishes. - Tem Zaru: shrimp, shiso and shishito tempura. i liked this best. VERY simple dish, but done well.- Soba Salad: soba over mesclun, topped with seaweed. comes with two dressings on the side, which you mix. - Curry Seiro chicken, tokyo negi (green onion) in hot curry dipping saucethe waiter comes around at the end to give broth which you can add to your dipping sauce for a soup. we also got 3 scoops of ice cream for dessert: green tea (VERY green tea-y), yuzu (an asian citrus), and black sesame (very rich, like an asian version of peanut butter).  it was a nice meal, but i thought rather expensive for plain-ish noodles. the total bill was over $80 and we were still hungry!
Karen D.}Philadelphia, PA}0}8}0}-1}4}6/5/2010}We came here on an all-expenses-payed triple birthday extravaganza so we sampled quite a few things.3 vegetable appetizer (sweet potato, edamamae, green beans): sweet potatoes are extra sweet which I love but some might not be a fan, edamame was standard and good as always, green beans have a really nice sesame saucepork belly: flavorful meat in a super sweet broth and a hint of mustard. A really nice combination! Possibly my favorite thing we tried but, again, don't order this if you don't like sweet foods.tempura: just what you would expect. tasty but nothing out of the ordinarypear sake cocktail: refreshing and sweetginger sake cocktail: spicy and pulpyFor my main dish I had the duck soba. The meat was flavorful with just the right amount of fatty and the noodles were great! The service was attentive so no complains there. The only thing that might be an issue is that the space is a bit cramped which one might expect at a restaurant that is rather popular.
Jeannie H.}Boston, MA}4}236}29}-1}3}5/28/2010}I was craving a delicious bowl of cold soba noodles on a hot summer day.  I love noodles.  I love soba.  But, I don't love Soba-ya.  I mean it's perfectly fine but it's nothing special.ATMOSPHERE - It's traditional Japanese.  We sat in the bar in back and it was kind of dark and depressing there.SERVICE - Perfectly timely and fine.FOOD - For an appetizer, we had the braised pork belly with a poached egg.  It was soaked in a flavourful (but slightly salty) sauce.  We had hot udon noodles with tempura.  I know it's stupid but I kind of like it when they serve the tempura on the side.  By the time they brought it to me, the tempura was a soggy mess with the batter falling off.  UGH!  We also had the cold soba noodles with uni.  The noodles had that perfect elasticity that comes with fresh soba.This is the kind of place I'd go to if I happened to be in the neighborhood but certainly not a place I would go out of the way for.
Wyolica W.}Manhattan, NY}160}19}21}-1}4}5/21/2010}I love noodles! Maybe its because my mom makes the best  Chinese pastry and noodles which makes me very critical about any types of noodles from Pho, Ramen, Soba, to Chinese "mien" ( like Cantonese or Taiwanese style). Okay, back to the Sobaya, they know how to make quality Soba. For all the Uni lovers (Sea Urchin), you guys gotto try out their Uni Cold Soba. It is the perfect dish for the hot summer in NYC. I can't really describe the unique taste of Uni soba because Uni is such unique seafood that you either love it or hate it. There is really nothing in between. However, I have heard the reason Sushi is so popular among people is because it triggers your 5th sense above your tongue which is indescribable with words. It is called "umami", Japanese for "savoury sensation". Umami is a fifth taste we can perceive, along with sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Well, since no words can describe it, you just have to try it out yourself now. I hope you will enjoy it!
James K.}El Cerrito, CA}232}475}163}18}2}5/15/2010}I love soba and eat it often, both at home and also out in restaurants. I looked forward to trying Soba-ya with its homemade noodles. Since the day was quite warm, I craved zaru soba (cold soba noodles with dipping sauce), and I ordered the tem zaru (zaru soba with tempura). The tempura was relatively standard, the shrimp's texture was good. The noodles themselves were more bouncy than some other places I've eaten at. One of my friends ordered the anago tempura (eel tempura), which was very delicious. The waitress gave us a pot of soba water to pour into the sauce so we could drink it as soup at the end of the meal. It wasn't really that special. Overall it's not a bad place, but it is also not spectacular. Note: The takoyaki hole-in-the-wall across the street is pretty good.
monica k.}Bayside, NY}0}52}0}-1}4}5/8/2010}fair price, filling, yummy food :) nice service. the japanese water who served us was cute ;) hehe
EJ F.}Brooklyn, NY}10}7}0}-1}5}4/30/2010}I will keep coming here for as long as it exists.  The traditional Japanese decor is truly relaxing, and the wonderful smells that greet you when you walk in let you know you're in the right place.  I never get the udon; I always go for the handmade soba noodles. (You can watch them roll and cut the noodles as you're waiting for a table.)It doesn't matter if you get a hot bowl or a cold bowl; they are delicious.  I've also had the unagi and tuna bowls...both are outstanding, bursting with flavor.  The unlimited green tea refills are soothing to the soul.  It's the kind of place where you just want to hang out, even after you've finished your delicious meal.
Michelle L.}Seattle, WA}244}38}0}-1}3}4/27/2010}I honestly don't understand what the hype is about. I had the udon and the yam pudding with sesame. The udon was not that great. I've had better for far less money. However, the pudding was very good. They have very good service, and it's very clean.
Dan K.}Kings Park, NY}64}14}0}-1}5}4/11/2010}I love this restaurant... Although it is always a battle between sitting down at Soba-ya or getting something from Otafuku. But, onto the soba. The restaurant as a really pleasant, traditional decor, which goes well with the handmade noodles and the other dishes they serve. I haven't been disappointed with any dish I have tried here, but I like getting yasai soba with tempura bits most often.I believe the characteristic that puts Soba-ya in the 5 star category is its atmosphere. A simple place for a traditionally simple dish. I like it.This restaurant is definitely worth the moderate wait for a table during the evening rush. It's an excellent start to the world of 'other' Japanese food, the ones stashed away in a forgotten section of your typical sushi joint menu. If 5 stars means taking a trip from central Suffolk with the primary goal of going to this restaurant without a special reason, then 5 stars it is.
samantha d.}New York, NY}104}99}0}-1}3}4/10/2010}A warning: Do NOT order the curry soba or the yakinasu, or you will disappointed.I usually order soba cold. The soba salad is great, but I have a preference for anything tororo (pureed mountain yam). I've tried most of the cold soba dishes on the menu and they are equally delicious. Nameko oroshi is so refreshing! They then bring sobayu (hot water which was used to boil the soba) at the end of the meal, which you are supposed to mix with any remaining dipping sauce, and sip the resulting product like a broth. It is a comforting way to end a meal.However, the curry soba was so bad that I actually paid extra to order some plain dipping sauce and eat it like zaru soba, forgoing the curry sauce entirely. My friend is equally vehement about the yakinasu, which she insists tastes like burnt cigarettes. I have not sampled it personally, but I trust her judgment. There are enough tempting things on the menu that it should not be too difficult to steer clear of these two dishes.The appetizers are ridiculously small and expensive. The soba dishes are all quite filling. If you do not have extra money to blow, it's probably not worth it to order appetizers.On an aside, I see celebrities here on a regular basis. It's not one of those "see in be seen" type places (quite the opposite!), but it attracts some well known faces.
B ..}New York, NY}16}277}0}-1}2}4/7/2010}-Had the Tartar Don w/3 types of fish: Salmon, Tuna, and Amberjack. -For dessert: Wasabe ice cream, red bean ice cream, and citrus ice cream. Though I was not too impressed by the above, I am willing to at least try the soba before submitting its final report card. Great service!
Marissa E.}New York, NY}2}12}0}-1}5}4/7/2010}The best udon/soba in the east village. the appetizers are also really great, i'm fan of the Japanese sweet potato particularly. Everything is always really fresh and never over cooked. Many ingredients are ordered straight from Japan for the best flavor.  The tempura batter is very light and flavorful and the sashimi is always fresh. I usually go with the Kake Udon then a sampling of appetizers.There is an early bird special that gets you a lot of food for a great price from 5:30-7pm also. Soba-ya has defiantly become by go-to restaurant when I don't know what I want to eat.
Annie P.}New York, NY}40}136}47}-1}5}4/4/2010}Busy busy place! Heard great things about this place so decided to come by for lunch and was glad i did cause their sobas were delicious. I ordered the Maguro Don from the Lunch set. It is alottt so you should share. it came with tuna over rice. the rice was seasoned and it was yumyum. tuna was fresh as well.BUT the soba was the best part. Ofcourse we ordered dessert...three different flavor. my favorite was this citrus flavor...iforget the name but there are only 4 flavors, green tea, red bean, vanilla and this citrus one, so remember to get the citrus one!
Derek K.}San Francisco, CA}51}35}1}-1}3}4/3/2010}This place has a pleasant traditional atmosphere.  Unsurprisingly, given the name of the restaurant:  the soba is very good.The udon is tasty, but cut skinny.  Depending on your preferences, this could be a bonus.  But I like Sanuki udon the best.It's a splurge for noodles:  you'll end up spending at least $15 @ lunch.  But, don't hesitate to give this place a try if you're in the mood for traditional Japanese noodles.  And remember to slurp, it's more fun that way and you'll look like a pro!
Varun G.}New York, NY}52}28}0}-1}3}3/21/2010}"OMGOSH SOBA-YA" is pretty much the hype that my friends put into the place when bringing me to this restaurant. We initially planned on going to Ippudo, but the 3 hour wait turned us away...so on we ventured for soba noodles!The place has nice decor, but nothing gaudy or annoying. After sitting down, we were given menus, which were a bit confusing to navigate -- how do bowls differ from noodles? In any case, I went for the Saturday duck special, and was recommended the soba noodles. Feeling hungry, I went for the large."Large" actually means more noodles, not more soup. I think I was the only person at my table who found the noodles to be nothing more than mediocre (gasp!), but nonetheless the broth was delicious and I kept slurping away until there was nothing left in the bowl.Overall, a good meal, but it may not have lived up to the "OMGOSH SOBA-YA" hype. A bit pricey for something which was average, but I would probably go back (and next time, I'll order the udon noodles).
Scott C.}San Francisco, CA}24}505}258}18}3}3/21/2010}You really can't go wrong with handmade noodles of any kind.  This place has been doing it well for years.  You will wait for a table because it is always packed.  The service is good and the food quite tasty.  Sure paying $16 for noodles seems a bit steep, but hand-made anything should cost a little extra, and you can tell the difference.  I would say go for the cold soba.  When you try this place, the noodles are the star, so the meats and sides are nice to haves but not necessary.  The hot soba is tasty (which is what I had) but the broth was way too salty.  You end up needing to drink a quart of water just to get that parched sensation out of the way.  The cold soba spares you from the broth yet still lets you enjoy the noodles.  Three stars.  I wish I could give 3.5, but the wait and the broth just keeps this place away from being a four star place.  For the price, you can go to Chinatown and get three bowls of hand pulled noodles which taste far better.
Chris T.}San Francisco, CA}107}322}190}-1}4}3/20/2010}Always hungry for soup noodles, I rushed to Soba-ya after coming across this feature in Food & Wine (foodandwine.com/articles…). Though I am more drawn to ramen (soba's richer, oiler, and unhealthier cousin), I was delighted by Soba-ya's simple, yet refined buckwheat noodles in hot broth. The tasty kamo featured the signature buckwheat soba noodles with two slices of roasted duck, sauteed spring onions, tofu skin, and shiitake mushrooms. The noodles, along with a shared order of tatsuta age (marinated fried chicken) made for a great meal on a chilly night -- and it was light enough that I had room for dessert.
petiza p.}San Francisco Bay Area, CA}6}16}5}-1}4}3/15/2010}Went on a Friday evening for a catch-up dinner with a girlfriend.The noodles (hot soba) were really tasty, but we had the vegetarian soup. Apparently, the meat soup with the noodles taste way better. The desserts were most exciting. We got the green brulee and tofu dessert dishes.Ambiance is nice - subtle Japanese decor and ambiance.The staff was nice and attentive.*I would return for the dessert.
Wen-fai F.}Tucson, AZ}17}174}19}-1}4}3/4/2010}I went with 5 people for dinner and we each paid $35 for 3 appetizers, a large bottle of sake, a soba entree each, and 1 dessert. Really not a bad deal at all. It could have been a better deal though.This was my first experience with a Japanese restaurant that DIDN'T specialize in sushi, and it was really pleasant. The presentation on the table was really beautiful and the service was fast. I ordered a soba dish with fried tofu, and everything tasted delicious.When we got there, we had to wait for 30 minutes but just hit up Cloister Cafe across the street to get a pre-dinner drink.The women's bathroom also has heated toilet seats! Win! I'll definitely look to come here again when I'm back in New York!
Chicken L.}Bergen County, NJ}4}54}1}-1}3}3/4/2010}Good, though not great soba noodles...i had the lunch set menu and, while a good value for price, the noodles just didn't do it for me.  I'll stick with soba-tatto/
Ben M.}Westchester, NY}4}13}5}-1}5}2/23/2010}Soba Ya is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city...and it doesn't even specialize in SUSHI, which I love! A good clue to quality here is the fact that you DO see a lot of Japanese people frequenting the place (sorry if that sounds politically incorrect, but it does say something when people enjoy a particular way their own cuisine is prepared). Soups are amazing, especially that forest Vegetable special which is only available on Thursday and Friday. I'd also go for udon over soba. A few appetizers I didn't care much for (like the Miso paste), but others like sauteed lotus root (kimpira), salmon belly, etc., are amazing. There seasonal sakes, when available, are simply the best I've ever had. And all at an affordable price, which is unusual in Manhattan.So go, go, go, go to Soba-Ya!
Tracy T.}New York, NY}71}129}2}-1}4}2/23/2010}I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the soba here. I did have relatively high hopes for this place even from looking at the online menu as it seemed quite authentic. AND it did not disappoint. From the moment we sat down, the service was great. The waitress was very attentive and they would pick up empty plates immediately. They were attentive with my sake and water glasses as well.I picked generic appetizers that would please the whole group: edamame, tamago, and kimpira gobo. All were tasty, but none really blew me out of the water. Now onto the soba. I've had my fair share of hand cut, homemade soba, and this was quite delicious. I would highly recommend the zaru soba just because I feel like you can definitely taste the quality of the noodles this way since you're dipping it into the broth instead of it cooking in hot broth. I had the side of tempura, and that was pretty good as well. Dessert. Oh how I wish I could have more of the honey wasabi ice cream. It was sweet to start and had a kick of the wasabi at the end. So amazing! I would go back just for that. The yuzu was okay. I've also had better black sesame ice cream... but man oh man, HONEY WASABI.Would I go back? DEFINITELY. Price point was slightly more expensive than I would've liked, but I think it was well worth it (especially for New York).
Matthew P.}East Stroudsburg, PA}56}276}133}-1}4}2/21/2010}Soba-ya is one of the many restaurants that have created a little Japan-town for NYU students and Japanese expatriots doing the Grand Tour of the East Village. And it's a stand out. I can't stop thinking of their homemade ice cream. Black poppy in one scoop and wasabi/honey in the other. You wouldn't think those would work, but they do. Save room for dessert. I love Japanese restaurants that don't serve sushi/shashimi. Not that I have anything against sushi, but let's face it, only a few places make it well, and life's too short. It's all about the noodles here. But this ain't no ramen shop. Here, the star is soba, narrow cut home made buckwheat noodles. As you enter, there's a guy pounding sheets of buckwheat and cutting them before your eyes. I love that they do that, but at the same time, the pounding gets a bit annoying. Only when the place fills up--which it does rapidly, does the pounding fade into the background. Lots of different ways to enjoy soba (and Udon too for those not appreciating buckwheat). Cold, hot, in broth. There's a lot of other selections including quite a range of Japanese appetizers you don't see often in the U.S. Not that I know much about Japanese culture, but the place was at least half filled with Japanese folks, which is usually a good sign. Very good food that will leave you satisfied.
Aya E.}Atlanta, GA}138}71}150}-1}4}2/17/2010}their soba is otherwordly. i love that they make it fresh and in-house. you can even watch they cut their noodles, which is great. i ordered the eel tempura soba, which i would absolutely recommend. the broth itself was really good and the soba noodles were awesome. i also had the yuzu ginger sake with hot water. they also offer it with sparkling water, but i like it much more with hot water. it's a great drink. it tastes like a bit like honeyed tea, which encouraged me to drink it fast and the sake was like a surprise kick in the face (but i mean that in the best way possible). the wait staff are really nice and very accommodating. this place gets super packed on friday and saturday nights.
H H.}Brooklyn, NY}30}227}0}-1}4}2/16/2010}It's strange that neither of the two things I like most at Soba-Ya are, well, soba.  Maybe it's because I know crap about soba.  Maybe it's because I just don't get that much soba elsewhere, so I am not aware of the spectacularness of Soba-Ya's soba.  I happily slurp it (and, alas, yes, I'm afraid I do probably slurp it... usually because I've had one too many drinks at Angel's Share beforehand, which might be why I can't properly assess the food).  Anyway, I digress.  What I really like at Soba-Ya are the shumai (!!!). And the honey wasabi ice cream.  I usually hate such flavors of ice cream.  In my world, ice cream really ought to be chocolate, smothered in hot fudge, stuffed between some bananas, and covered in sprinkles (in essence, I like my ice cream just as a 6-year old would).  But somehow I have developed this odd desire for the honey wasabi ice cream, to the point that I might just start ordering other crazy (ie, not chocolate or vanilla) ice creams.  And, frankly, I'm not the world's biggest shumai lover, really.  But those two things, I love.  That's seriously the main motivation for me to go to Soba-Ya.  And while I'm there, I enjoy the soba, too, so I guess it's all good.Oh, and they've got this crazy heated toilet seat thing going on right now.
John B.}Philadelphia, PA}82}192}68}-1}4}2/13/2010}My wife is as obsessed with soba as I am with ramen. We came here for lunch and got the famous hand-made soba. Yes, when a place is named after (and is famous for) a dish, you must get it.We got a cold soba (regular) and hot soba (with shrimp tempura). We liked the texture of the cold soba better. It was nice and chewy. Dip it into the soba sauce and slurp we go. The hot soba makes the noodle a bit softer than the consistency I like for noodles. But the broth is really delicious. The broth seems to be combination of the soba sauce and mushroom dashi stock. Very clean flavor and very good.We got the uni and (grated) mountain yam appetizer. It was just okay. The way to eat the dish was to put some soy sauce over the dish, but after doing so, you can't really taste uni.It was a bit expensive as well. But I guess everything in NYC is expensive.
Elliot L.}Manhattan, NY}38}94}49}-1}4}2/13/2010}Great soba here. It's handmade in the shop. They have various soups with various veggies or meats. I had the one with duck and onions, and the duck was amazing. The broth was very rich, and the noodles were chewy, just the way soba should be. The appetizers were great too. The shrimp tempura soba sushi is definitely worth getting. Dessert wise, there were two great desserts: the ice cream. 3 scoops including yuzu (must-try), and green tea that was bursting with green tea flavor. The matcha brulee is a take on creme brulee using green tea matcha, and it's very creamy and flavorful. My favorite dessert by far. Avoid the milk pudding.This place is highly recommended for dinner. Fun to share desserts and a great place to get noodles on a cold night.
H K.}New York, NY}225}49}63}-1}3}2/11/2010}Had a lunch meeting here last week. The atmosphere is questionable however the food was good. I ordered the soft shell crab soba and my partner had the uni soba. Not bad.... but not excellent.
serena t.}New York, NY}40}21}0}-1}4}1/31/2010}Sobaya was a lovely experience. The simple wooden decor of the restaurant and the all-Japanese waitstaff with their cute accents really added a much-needed charm to a place like this in the city.The food, however, needs a bit more scrutiny. The tuna tartare appetizer was not appetizing at all. The tuna was sort of mushy and layered between avocado mush and something else that looked like onion and could have been jicama. Anyway, neither compliment complimented much.The soba, though, was phenomenal. I had the tempura, highly recommended. I guess some places are just good at certain things, but hey, its their specialty and it was delicious. Overall pleasant. OH and dessert was great! Try the matcha brulee.
John M.}Brooklyn, NY}0}181}0}-1}4}1/25/2010}I've been to this place multiple times.  Great food in a cool setting.  Hope you like noodles.
Olivia L.}New York, NY}139}70}50}-1}4}1/24/2010}Before going to watch Avatar, my uncle Keith, my cousin Celina, and I headed over to Soba-ya on E. 9th Street. My uncle's philosophy is to stick to the restaurant's specialty, and Soba-ya's is handmade soba noodles. We started with 3 appetizers: tuna tartar with chopped mountain yam and avocado, tatsuta age - deep-fried marinated chicken, and some sort of fish liver pate. I wasn't too enthused about the mountain yam, but the crunchy texture was there to contrast with the tuna and avocado. Another of my uncle's wise words: Japanese food is all about texture. The deep-fried chicken was lighter and more delicious than American deep-fried chicken - virtually guilt-free! And the fish liver...OMG, I loved it!!! Gleaming orange pate in ponzu sauce with a very clean taste!Main courses? We all had cold soba: my uncle's with uni (fresh sea urchin with grated mountain yam); my cousin's with tem zaru (shrimp, shiso and shishito tempura); and mine with ikura oroshi (salmon roe and grated radish). My uncle likes sea urchin, but he discarded the grated mountain yam. Why? Because it had a really disgusting texture - like okra when it's not fried. He said grated mountain yam is supposed to be like that... My cousin devoured her soba with shrimp tempura. I did the same with my ikura. I LOVE SALMON ROE!!! Soba-ya is the only place I know where I can get salmon roe without it being piled on top of sushi rice and wrapped in nori. And they gave me a pretty good amount of it! I figured, if soba noodles are going to cost $15 a bowl, I should get it with something that I can't eat anywhere else. Totally worth it, and apparently cheaper than the soba with chicken. @_@We finished off with dessert - milk tofu with strawberry. Clean, light, and refreshing!Now, you're probably thinking, $15 for soba noodles?! Outrageous! But Soba-ya has been around for over 20 years, so they must be doing something right. Plus, handmade soba noodles taste remarkably better than store-bought ones (of course!). But it's also the Japanese hospitality that I picked-up on: warm towels before the start of the meal, the careful delivery and removal of the dishes. Just one last word of advice: order the large noodles (+50 grams, at least) if you're used to American portions!
Renee M.}New York, NY}126}340}18}-1}4}1/21/2010}The BF and I were in the mood to re-live a recent trip out to TK, sitting at a local mom and pop soba shop, talking over a warm broth, meeting the locals and just plain enjoying each other....and then harsh reality kicked in that we were in NYC in the dead of winter....Where O Where could we go for some kick ass Soba and Udon....and just as fate would have it...the sign SOBa-Ya came into view....We were waved in by a friendly hostess...seated immediately at the bar, where sweet yams, grilled eggplants, and various other delish appitizers sat....I had cravings to just reach out and eat the entire plate of sweet yams...but I'm a LAdy (so I was reminded through out the night, and could not do that.... lol) We started off with some soba-ya sushi rolls (which ended up being fresh soba wrapped with shrimp tempura in seaweed with a dipping sauce) It was both refreshing and light....THe main spolight of the evening for us other than of course the soba and udon was the Fatty pork with poached quail egg...Ladies and GEnts I would give my right spleen for a whole fatty pig that been marinated and treated with the culinary skills that the chefs at Soba-ya gave to my appitizer....
Heejin L.}San Francisco, CA}1890}1859}1977}-1}4}1/18/2010}the homemade soba noodles are very chewy/crunchy. THe uni soba w grated mountain yam ($20) is pretty good. their uni isn't the greatest but it goes well with the yam and the noodles.  you can pour in the broth they used to make the noodles with in later to your bowl and drink it as a soup.
Darwin G.}New York, NY}276}954}67}18}3}1/18/2010}A cute soba restaurant. With two friends, we shared two appetizers. For the first time trying sea urchin, we had the Uni Tororo (sea urchin with grated mountain yam). I really enjoy sea urchin, but it was awkward with three of us with little spoons picking at a small bowl. The grated yam is a foam and does not add much to the dish.Going with trends, we obviously had to order the pork belly. Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly with poached egg in soy sauce - based broth). Now that's what I'm talking about. The broth was salty and sweet. The pork was braised to soft perfection. I definitely suggest it.They have a daily special soba and on Saturday, it was the Kinoko (sautéed duck & mushrooms). There's nothing better than hot soup on a freezing winter day. Three types of mushroom, though I would've been fine with only shitake. There could've been a few more pieces of duck. The broth was so good that they could bottle it up and sell it.I had a taste of the green tea ice cream. I think they make it there themselves because it's not even sweet. It really holds the flavor and a slight bitterness of green tea.The only thing that takes away from the dinner is $10 urchin appetizer that was disappointing and minuscule and the $15 price tag on the soba.
stewart s.}New York, NY}109}83}23}-1}3}1/14/2010}This place is not a tranny mess but it was full of trannies -- notably a 6'8" Asian man with the most Geisha of mannerisms and a hint of rouge on the cheeks.  From an ambiance perspective, you'll be thankful because other than people watching, it's just fluorescent lights in an otherwise clean but dull room.  I'm not a Japanese culinary expert but that bowl of homemade Soba sure was good.  Duck, scallions, soba, broth = $17.  First, I chop sticked in the bowl and slurped - wetting my face, the table and those next to me.  Luckily, I noticed a poised woman near who swirled her noodles with chopstix & then placed them in the spoon to cool and take a bite without the messy ole slurping and spraying maneuver I was taking.  My dining companion approved as she was looking for a poncho before I noticed the appropriate bowl-to-mouth trick.The server kind of looked down on me for ordering sake warm, but what the heck, I like it that way on a cold day.  We were too full (had Wasabi dumplings at Decibel across the street as an appetizer) for anything but noodles so I missed out on the legendary soba-crab salad. I'll save it for next time I'm in the mood for authentic Japanese noodles & a room full of trannies.P.S. They place a salt-shaker looking device on the table with your soba.  It's full of chili-flake goodness to add a kick to the rich broth.  Yum.P.P.S. They bring a basket of ornate sake cups and have you choose your own.  Nice touch.
Jane K.}San Francisco, CA}4452}1215}1901}-1}4}1/14/2010}Just call me Grandma. Seriously, I like to eat dinner early. And when it's 20 degrees and the wind is blowing and it gets dark at like 3pm...yeah, I'm gonna go to dinner at 6:30pm. Luckily I have grandma friends so I don't look like an old maid. Enter Soba-ya's early bird special. For $18 I indulged in a feast fit for a Golden Girl...Appetizer platter: savory tamago, tuna belly, fried shrimp ball, sweet potato, sesame spinachEntree: Soba or udon. I wanted duck which was $6 extra but so worth it. Soba is made fresh in-house and with the oily savory duck broth...just incredible. Along with the soba the tray (yes, a tray!) was filled with a plate of shrimp and veggie tempura, sauces, extra scallions, and rice balls wrapped in bean curd. We could easily have shared...but mama was hungry. Dessert: vanilla ice cream with strawberry topping...yuuuum. The restaurant was adorable and waitstaff incredibly friendly and attentive. We received hot tea after taking our seat, without having to ask. Our hot sake carafe was generous and only $13. The majority of patrons were Japanese and the tasted authentic. Really it was the perfect spot for catching up with a friend and not breaking the bank. Now, go fetch me my cane.
WeiKay L.}Flushing, NY}74}23}72}-1}5}1/14/2010}Their broth is very unique!! perfectly portioned meal. love their honey wasabi ice cream! XD
george t.}Long Island City, NY}8}171}0}-1}2}1/13/2010}Over hyped and over priced. had the tempura soba and the duck soba. the Duck was dissapointing because the broth lost alot of its original favor due to the duck meat. the tempura soba was better and forgettable, the tempura was very well cooked, but the noodle and the brooth is average. two bowls of soba for 40 without tax, you can get a much better meal elsewhere near this place.
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}5}1/7/2010}This place is just as great as Sakagura in Midtown! Homemade fresh buckwheat soba noodles. The broth is made just right and not too salty like most places. They have special "set" portions that are usually larger with more options than if you order one item. They also have homemade black sesame ice cream! Its a must try! :)
nancy d.}New York, NY}88}72}14}-1}3}1/7/2010}It was nice, nothing spectacular, their soba and udon soups are good but not really worth $16-18. We had average service and an average meal, for an above average cost. Would i go back? Eh,  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.
Laurie K.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}1}12/26/2009}there is nothing special about this place!   i live in the neighborhood so i went for the second time (the first time was forgettable).  again, it was disappointing. this place would probably appeal to non-japanese people. but growing up eating soba and udon my whole life, it is truly unremakable and way overpriced. trust.
Becky S.}Nyack, NY}29}231}1}-1}5}12/17/2009}We were visiting NYC this weekend and found this place through my handy Yelp app on my phone.  The food was really good.  There were four of us dining for lunch, and all four of us enjoyed our meals.  My husband and I both had the Cooked Duck and Sauteed Tokyo Negi -- yum!  My mom had the Lunchbox which she thoroughly enjoyed, and my dad had the Chilled Sesame Tofu and the Tuna Sashimi and declared both delicious.  We also enjoyed Japanese beers and sake.  The prices were reasonable as well.  Definitely recommend.
avalon e.}Sunnyvale, CA}22}228}18}-1}5}12/17/2009}You know you are in the midst of good food culture when you see people of different ethnicity ordering some REAL ethnic food offered by an establishment.  No Kung pao mushu or teriyuccki or tempura.   We sat down next to an indojin and gaijin and were surprised they ordered uni tororo, ankimo ponzu, and nisshin (herring) soba without asking for any explanation.  Ironically I was the henna Chugokujin who ordered the $18 early bird dinner set.  Great deal, fresh ingredients, good service, unpretentious atmosphere, great eye candy clientele albeit not my favorite anorexic drugged supermodel type seen at mercer kitchen.  Thumbs up!
emily ahn l.}Brooklyn, NY}12}37}0}-1}5}12/8/2009}super good.incredible vegetable tempura. and fantastic kimpira. soba is yummy. and the bowls of tuna and salmon, accompanied by the mushroom broth soup, is clean and perfect. the ice creams are delicious: yuzu, black sesame, and honey wasabi.
Melody H.}New York, NY}178}286}0}-1}4}11/20/2009}When a restaurant's name includes its signature dish, you should probably order that dish.My friends and I decided to try three different hot soba dishes: tempura soba, chicken curry soba, and roast duck soba.The tempura soba was the closest to original, as I asked for the tempura to be brought on the side. I was struck immediately by the pristine, unadulterated taste of the perfectly cooked buckwheat noodles. The flavors of the broth and the noodles were so clean, perfectly accented by the chopped green onions served on the side. Also, three huge tempura shrimp were yum.The chicken curry soba was the heaviest of the three sobas, in essence it was a Japanese curry served over soba noodles rather than rice. It was still delicious, but I think you lose the flavor of the soba noodle because it's overpowered by the stronger flavor of the curry.The roast duck soba had the richest broth of the bunch, oozing with the unctuous goodness that you get from fatty, savory duck.I still preferred the tempura soba, as I felt it was truest to the flavors of hot soba.Next time, I will try the udon, but it's not called Udon-ya, you know?
Anna C.}New York, NY}103}192}18}-1}2}11/13/2009}I'm sorry, but I really don't get what the big deal is with this place. A couple of my friends love it, plus there's always a line out the door.I try not to review any place until I've tried it at least twice. Well I have, and I'm not impressed.The first time I came here, I had the Yasai Soba (mixed veggies and mushrooms) and shared some veggie appetizers. It was ok, not a bad meal, but not worth waiting in line for in the cramped waiting space. The second time, I had one of their specials that day, which was a soba with "grilled" mushrooms in a dashi broth. What I got was just a bowl of noodles in soup with some mushrooms thrown on top, clearly not grilled as far as I could tell. And the broth was not particularly special. The various veggie appetizers while fresh, were not worth the price for their small portions. Maybe it's just a cultural thing, since I've got a big fat American appetite.Or perhaps it's because I haven't tried any of their meat items, but a vegetarian friend swears by this place. So I guess it's just me. I guess I just don't get it. I'm just not willing to spend $15 on an unremarkable bowl of noodles.
Ashley S.}New York, NY}562}212}309}-1}4}11/13/2009}This restaurant is a consistent winner.  I have been so many times and am never let down.  A good piece of advice for all restaurants though is you need to stick to what they are known for.  This place is known for their big bowls of udon and soba noodle soup.  Ideal for a cold winter day when you need to be warmed to the core.I come to this place when I need a good home cooked meal and something that will really hit the spot in so many ways.  The atmosphere is charming, cozy and quietly buzzing with people who are happy and content, the food is just great and as you look around the place you see people engaged in good conversation and smiling.It may have something to do with the crazy heated toilet seat in the bathrooms that keeps people coming back again and again.  Not to mention the bathrooms are kept pristinely clean.What I had this last time I ate at Soba-ya and was delighted with each and everything I ordered:Starters:Box of Sake ($14.00) - Let me explain this whole box thing, as this was my first experience.  I knew I wanted more than a 'double shot glass' sized amount of sake, that is the smallest increment they offer in terms of sake  ($7.00)  so the next one up is box.  It is literally a square glass dish that you sip your sake from and it was fun and unusual and I loved it. I liked drinking from the corners!  More than enough sake for one little girl like me, perfect for couples sharing just trying to have a  "warm cheeks" sake glow.The kind that I picked was the last bottle on the back page of the drinks menu.  They only offer two unfiltered sakes, ( I love unfiltered sake the most because you can really taste the rice)  I was not let down by this choice it was cloudy and sweet, so great!Appetizers:Agedashi Tofu ($8.00) was excellent,  3 homemade cubes of tofu very silky and topped with shredded ginger, roots, scallions, mushrooms, daikon and served in a delicious broth. Salmon Sashimi ($8.00) surprisingly great quality of fish since this place is not "known" for their sushi rather their noodle bowls.  The display of this appetizer was breathtaking with a purple orchid on the plate with the salmon slices gently placed around it on a bed of seaweed and daikon with a lemon wedge too!  such buttery salmon...Entrees:Chicken Tempura ($9.00)  We had never had this before and were very pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of this.  Not boring at all!  It is served in triangles with the perfectly moist chicken of the highest quality wrapped in an interesting large leaf that I noticed was served as a garnish to the sashimi that when tasted alone resembles something near basil and cilantro but more muted and slightly bitter.  It was great wrapping the chicken in the thin layer of herb that it provided and then the chicken was tempura battered and lightly fried. Served wonderfully hot yet not too hot, not greasy or oily as some poor versions of tempura can often be but perfectly light and crispy.  The kicker was the green tea salt that they serve this dish with!  Why is it so freaking good, I wouldn't let them take it away after the dish was finished.  One light dusting of the green tea salt across your open bite of chicken and you bite into something heavenly. Love the crunch of the tempura.  I will never look at chicken fingers the same again...never...why did soba-ya do this to me? I need to eat this dish again in the near future it may be a new addiction! Yasai Udon Bowl ($13.00) This is my favorite bowl hands down tried and true.  I have gotten the other bowls, same sized but b/c they come with 3 shrimp tempuras they are (19.00)  I would rather just enjoy this dish that is big enough for two people to share after having eaten several appetizers before.  The broth is a clear tan broth with so much flavor, tons of scallion and shredded mushrooms and daikon are also in the soup.  The udon is cooked to perfection.  If you want to kick it up a notch the spicy chili flakes are available on the table.DessertBlack Sesame Ice Cream ($3.50 a scoop or 3 scoops for $6.00)  - I love any and all things black sesame and this ice cream is no exception.  Served on a bed of crunchy things that gives the flavor a nice nutty after taste. The ice cream is white with black sesames throughout and it looks like cookies and cream when looking at people eating it on tables around you!  I have had better black sesame ice cream ( En Japanese) but the meal was a lot more.Green Tea Ice Cream - not a highly recommended green tea ice cream.  Go somewhere else if this is what you are craving.  It tasted to me like green tea that had been over steeped and had that bitter tang in the back of your mouth and was not creamy enough.Free Hot Green Tea at end of the meal. I am sure you could ask for it at any point in the meal...in fact I actually have and it was always free and very good high quality green tea (Im pretty sure its the popcorn kind) with a nice nutty aroma.Happy Eating!Ashley
Deedee G.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}2}11/6/2009}The edamame was quite good.Curry Soba: salty would be an understatement and the soba noodles were mushy. Chicken....tasteless.The highlight of this place was watching men and women line up to sit on the heated toilet seat (in the ladies room). They even have business cards for this toilet seat right in the restroom. Wait staff is friendly and service was excellent...but the food left me dehydrated and unsatisfied.
Amy N.}San Francisco, CA}26}287}64}-1}4}11/5/2009}I got the cold soba with ikura and grated radish. This is my first time having real soba that was just made. I enjoyed it, but definitely prefer other types of noodles with more chew. The sauce comes in separate container to drizzle over your noodles. Not really a dipping procedure, but the ikura kept the flavors interesting.My friend's hot soba soup with vegetables and mushrooms (the Yasai) was hot and comforting. The broth tasted especially good.What left the biggest impression, though, was the inari sushi that comes with lunch. I was never fond of inari sushi, but the rice inside the bean curd skin was fluffy and had some veggies and sesame seeds. It was so delicious I saved the 2nd one as my last bite after the soba.You should definitely get the desserts here. The milk tofu has a creamy consistency, but is not heavy. The brandied strawberry on top is something I'm going to try to make at home. The yuzu ice cream really tasted like yuzu (you can see bits of peel everywhere), but it was more fluffy than dense, and I'd have preferred a stronger flavor. My friend quite enjoyed it, though.The outside of the restaurant is a bit non-descript. The inside feels like you're in Japan. It's not strange for someone to come in and eat alone. There are booths for larger groups, but it's still a "nice" restaurant with dark wood interior. You could have a relaxing yet intimate dinner here. The service was very friendly. Our server took the time to point out the dishes on our platters. The prices are a bit higher than a normal noodle restaurant, but the food is worth it (you can get udon instead of soba, too). Their menu is extensive enough, and you can get interesting side orders. I recommend going for lunch or stopping by in the evening for a snack or a dessert.
Chris C.}Plainfield, NJ}130}347}49}18}4}11/5/2009}Same owners as Decibel and Sakagura same food pretty much as well.  I would drop by in a heartbeat for some cold soba.  Not too pricey for their combo soba boxes.  Its very tight space but fun to go nonetheless when you are craving soba. My favorite soba is from Nobu who does a wicked cha soba but Sobaya is pretty good in and of itself.
Christian R.}Woodside, Queens, NY}135}343}24}-1}4}10/12/2009}What a pleasant experience to come here during a stressful week and have a myriad of dishes to choose from. There's the menu and then the sake menu with ample choices. You can order a small, box or large bottle of any sake. The menu and waiters are helpful though it's hard to decide. We settled on a box each of different sakes. I had the sesame spinach as an appetizer- unfortunately a dry small amount, lightly salted. My dinner of Tuna sashimi wasn't enough so I ordered another entree.
Daniel D.}San Francisco, CA}118}455}40}-1}2}10/11/2009}Hostess was as accommodating as possible, given that it's somewhat (not super) busy on the weekends.  She took our phone number and called us when there was room to eat at the bar.  However, we took her up on her offer to continue waiting for a real table.  Total wait time was less than 30 minutes for a table, and this was during prime weekend time.We had a pretty good appetizer (don't remember which one), but it was fairly expensive and not a ton of food.We both ordered the chicken curry (hot, not cold) with soba noodles.  It wasn't what the waiter had described - a small amount of thick curry sauce.  Instead it was more like a watery-soup with some noodles and strange-shaped chicken chunks floating around.  It wasn't particularly flavorful or tasty.  Neither of us really enjoyed it that much.Ate dinner.  Got the check.  Left.  That's the whole story.  Nothing special, and I'm probably not going back, unless someone can convince me that I simply ordered the wrong soba and that the others are much better.
Austin C.}New York, NY}0}35}0}-1}3}10/11/2009}Sometimes being too authentic can hurt. Limiting your menu can be good, but when a place limits their menu without providing much variety, I end up deciding from items I merely tolerate vs. something I'm actually excited about. The soba selection made me feel the way I do when I hear a song with too many techno remixes that sound the same. The shumai were nicely done but the wasabi dip was too asian-fusion a la Tao for me. The chawanmushi was blatantly overpriced at $8.50 for a cup of steamed egg custard worth maybe about $0.45...and that's being generous. The fishcake soba had some great flavor to the soup base but otherwise I'm not itching for more.
lora c.}New York, NY}76}254}22}-1}3}9/26/2009}I left full but unsatisfied. Perhaps I came in with inflated expectations but dinner was only a 3-star experience. The noodles stuck to each other in clumps, as if they had been left out for too long or improperly rinsed. Perhaps we came on an off-night but the quality just wasn't quite there. My boyfriend chides me and tells me I can only expect so much from a bunch of carbohydrates. It seems I am always being disappointed by noodles!Still, all the broths I tasted were pretty excellent. Hearty, flavorful, and fragrant, they were refreshingly more savory than sweet. I far preferred my cold soba (I had the duck with green scallion) with hot dipping broth to my boyfriend's hot soba (fish cake and tempura flakes). Unfortunately, the high sodium content left me feeling a little bloated and heavy for the next few days-- the complete opposite of what I usually expect after a meal of healthy cold buckwheat noodles. I'd return and give Sobaya another chance. The small plates looked excellent and I loved the crispy tofu in broth. Portions were filling, though on the tiny side. Service was also very good, and even though it turned out to be sodium-overload, I love the fact that the waitress gave us a little pot of soba-yu for our broth. I seriously doubt if I'll ever find a place as good as Honmura An for soba, but still, the search continues!
Nat W.}Kapolei, HI}258}1975}1560}18}4}9/24/2009}This place is great!  I came to this place with my friend for lunch.  My friend is the one who introduced me to this place.  We ordered lunch special.  I had a half portion of their cold soba noodle and unadon (eel over rice) with some side dish for $15.  Their unadon and the side dish were not bad at all.  Their cold soba?  AMAZING!  Let's say you are in Japan.  You would still consider their soba good quality.  The second time I came here, the soba quality seemed to have dropped for some reason and the price went up too.  Only for that reason I give it 4-star, if not a 5!  I would love to go back there again!  The service is always good too :)
Benedict E.}London, United Kingdom}1}61}1}-1}4}9/21/2009}Very very good noodles, decent pricing, good classic menu
Alexander T.}Houston, TX}48}525}207}-1}3}9/15/2009}This restaurant addresses my main pet peeve for Japanese cuisine; it actually fills you up!The Lunch menu is amazing, and the wide variety of flavors and small accompanying dishes are sure to please the most american of appetites. The standard fare comes with tempera, side salad, some sort of noodles, and your main dish, Definitely recommended as it seems more authentic then random places opened up by other ethnicities.Also apparently we saw this "JYP" character there; so if you are some random Korean fan of this '2pm' business you can stalk the guy there and go about being crazy as usual. I have been informed that rabid fans like doing stuff like that.
Yoko K.}New York, NY}31}29}0}-1}5}9/13/2009}As soon as you walk in you can smell the delicious broth and fresh noodles. Try a sampler of any of the vegetable dishes. My favorite is the mountain yam in pickled plum sauce with shiso leaves on top. The squid and sticky rice appetizer is also amazing.  Of course, any of the soba or udon dishes are great.  The server was also incredibly helpful in helping us pick out the right sake and to pick all the dishes so they could complement each other. As a native Japanese, I am a huge fan.
Jim U.}Washington, DC}669}1303}3042}-1}4}9/8/2009}A picture-perfect, traditional Japanese lunch that tastes amazing and can be had at an affordable price; what more could you ask for?  I highly recommend the Kamo.  It has handmade soba noodles that separate beautifully in the broth and taste wonderful.  The broth is fragrant and delicious.  In fact, the lovely aroma was the first thing I noticed about the dish!  The negi was especially fresh.  The duck was generous in portion and had almost no fat.  I really loved this dish.  And the restaurant is understated, functional, and remarkably clean.  A gem in the East Village!
Dee G.}New York, NY}82}262}143}-1}5}9/4/2009}REAL soba! The buckwheat soba here is rare to find in restaurants AND have it cooked so well. Though the place is tight (you can practically share dishes with your neighboring tables) it's good food you're here for. I got the buckwheat soba in a soup full of veggies and meats. Perfect thin texture. The long wait on a busy night was well worth it. Green tea served constantly, keeps you nice and warm. I was pleasantly surprised with Soba-ya, will definitely come again.
Cindy C.}New York, NY}78}287}0}-1}4}9/3/2009}Solid 4 stars! After a night out and having way too much to drink, we opted to have some authentic japanese food, and soba ya was the restaurant of choice. First of all, usually, i'm not the biggest fan of soba, and I'm usually hesitant to order it because so often, there is a lack of flavor and the noodles are just sub par. Not at soba - ya. Not only are the noodles supreme, the sauces are refreshing yet flavorful. Even after a whole plate of noodles, I didn't find the sauce too salty and nor did I get sick of it. The noodles were also absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh. So lots of stars for that! The lunch sets are also really generous at a great price. The service was also friendly and the place is nice and clean, loved the atmosphere.
Dan G.}Palo Alto, CA}14}86}36}-1}5}8/25/2009}Have been here a few times and have enjoyed it enough to think about going back, several times a week. On my first visit, I had the duck udon served cold and was a little surprised at how little duck I got, but the noodles and broth were definitely up to par. The other day I got the pork soup; again a small portion for the price, but delicious all the way through; would put just about any other ramen shop to shame if it had noodles in it. I also tried the salmon sashimi, which was decently priced and tasty for the $9 price.Each time I've gotten the honey wasabi ice cream, which is worth the visit itself.
Ash C.}New York, NY}16}121}10}-1}4}8/22/2009}Ramen is more my thing but this was pretty good too. The udon was the cleanest, tastiest I've had. The appetizers were also pretty good. However one dish I did not like so much was the vegetable cold soba - it was quite slimy from one of the vegetables I think (the seaweed?). Awesome being able to watch the guy make soba right there in the restaurant though. However the banging was a bit annoyi
Ann L.}New York, NY}9}150}0}-1}3}8/16/2009}Got the lunch box and loved the variety that comes with it - you get a big old dish of soba or noodles (hot or cold), shrimp and veggie tempura, one piece of inari, a piece of tamago egg, small salad in the typical yummy japanese dressing, piece of chicken (which was rather dry actually), assorted mushrooms and veggies, and then a mini-dessert at the end (which today was a strawberry cream gelatin of some sort with a strawberry piece on top).  Not bad in terms of variety, right??  But STILL, $17 for small portions is alot, especially when that was one of the cheaper options on the menu.  Even a simple bowl of soba or udon is roughly $15 and up.  yikes. Pleasant staff, not too busy, nice ambience overall for lunch. As others suggested, stick with the soba option - the udon noodles were not bad, but they were just about thin as the soba noodles (that is NOT how they should be in my book) and didn't taste as good.
Dave C.}New Hyde Park, NY}44}193}48}-1}3}8/11/2009}Well i think this place is not bad just not great.I got the seasonal sat / duck + soba thingamabogger and the girl got the udon + una don. We also shared the salmon sashimi... they were good i suppose, but to me it seemed overpriced and way tiny portions.The stuff is very light and doesnt make u feel stuffed, even though i love that feeling haha.  I guess its just not my thing.  but my girl loves it which means i have to go back.
Ken C.}New York, NY}49}651}2}-1}2}7/30/2009}Just over price on everything.  The Soba is not cold enough.  Service is slow and take forever to get the Order.  However the cleaning crew took my disk right after I done.  The beer is not cold at all, only the glass.  I'm lost on this restaurant after I read all these review.  The review just don't match up what I see.  It is only Thur and not even the rush hour until half way during my dinner.  Disappointed.
JP E.}Larchmont, NY}8}43}3}-1}4}7/28/2009}Currently my favorite Soba place in NYC.  The noodles are awesome, with the buckwheat flown in from Japan and worth the wait.  Soba-koh is getting close but I still pick Soba-ya.
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}4}7/25/2009}Came here on a Saturday afternoon, it was pretty busy but there was no wait.  The decor is pretty nice, and from what I understand, about as "authentic" as it can get.  I'm not a huge fan of soba noodles, but this place was definitely pretty good.  I got the lunch box set for $17 which is a good amount of food to fill you up.  There were a few things in there that were a little weird to eat, but the noodles, fish, and tempura were definite winners.  It even came with dessert at the end which I couldn't tell exactly what it was (something similar to creme brulee) but still very good nonetheless.
Jo K.}New York, NY}267}494}313}18}5}7/24/2009}Soba-ya.. Oh how I love thee.. I've always been a cold soba lover since i was a little and I was super happy my buddy introduced me to this place two years ago. Since then, I've been here quite a few times and I often eat here by myself for lunch. I really like their bento boxes but my most favorite thing here is their soba and cold udon with Uni on it and a side order of sushi rice in bean curd. They also have really yummy agedashi-tofu.  I luuuurve this place.
Jin L.}New York, NY}0}10}2}-1}1}7/24/2009}i was charged 3 times on my credit card and when i called to straighteb it out, they were very rude about it!!! i am never going there again
Joe C.}Forest Hills, NY}5}219}3}-1}4}7/23/2009}i love the noodles at sobaya.  it's a great place and their fat pork is absolutely delicious.  i always get their cold soba noodles and dipped in that cold soy sauce...amazing.  highly recommended...especially if you are into soba noodles (obviously).
craig c.}New York, NY}2}62}0}-1}4}7/22/2009}after seeing this place consistently crowded i finally decided to go.  i got the cold soba with uni and japanese yam.  i'd never had cold soba before so the taste was definitely unique to me but i liked the flavors.  would probably go for the hot soba next time.  my friend got the hot soba chirashi special and i felt i got a lot more flavor of the broth from the hot one.  we started the cold sesame tofu which was very tasty but i would expect more than a 1 inch cube for 5.50.   i would prefer to give this place 3.5 stars as i thought it was definitely overpriced for what it was but since i was very happy with my food i rounded up.  would definitely go again.
T D.}Morgan Hill, CA}0}123}0}-1}5}7/15/2009}Disclaimer, I am not a soba connoisseur... However, I consider my palette moderately refined and feel that this is the best place in its category in NYC.  The soba is perfectly bouncy, buoyant, and ever-so-slightly chewy.  The flavor is good.  Pricing is reasonable.  It's authentic, but very clean.  Its seating is usually pretty accessible any day of the week.
Barry W.}New York, NY}15}58}0}-1}4}7/8/2009}This place is small, clean, and the wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  They make the noodles fresh on the spot and is very tasty.  I will say however that portions are very small and this place is expensive ($18 for a bowl of Udon???!!!).  But you can't argue with the taste and the quality of the food and the overall dining experience, which is why I've been a regular here for the past 4 years.
Zohra C.}New York, NY}1}7}2}-1}4}7/3/2009}I really enjoy this place, their soba is pretty great.  It's freshly made and the texture is just right, especially the cold soba.  Their kitchen dishes aren't bad either, but the soba is the real winner.  They have pretty reasonable lunch sets too which come with either hot or cold soba.  Their soba salad with crab is also great!  Wish they did take out, that would be my go to dish.
Cynthia k.}Los Angeles, CA}57}214}11}-1}5}7/1/2009}it's not udon-ya or sushi-ya, it's soba-ya.  so order the soba.  perfectly cooked and tender, with just the right springy consistency, it pairs nicely with salted broth and duck slices.  start off with shiso-leaf wrapped chicken tenders that have been dusted in tempura batter and lightly fried, and i challenge you to be anything other than wholly satisfied.  the green tea is superb.
David M.}Santa Monica, CA}40}60}4}-1}4}6/26/2009}I think Dena Stokes  is not 100% right about her review about this place because I am the friend of her who recommended her this place and I don't eat see food. They have a good variety of veggie soups with that Asian flavor that is beyond good.
Emma L.}Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY}137}373}168}-1}4}6/22/2009Updatedreview}I'm a Soba-Ya convert!Stick with their staple dish... duh... Soba!  Sometimes when something is right infront of your face, you completely miss it.Do not deviate from the obvious, which is, uhm, the name of this restaurant.  The real winner here is all things cold soba.  Don't bother with the udon or hot dishes.  My go-to orders here are fried chicken appetizer and duck cold soba, especially with the warm weather approaching.  DONE.  My mouth is completely drooling thinking about this.
Katee L.}Los Angeles, CA}121}263}23}-1}3}6/21/2009}I'm giving this rating based on the one meal I had. However, this place shows promise so I think I'll have to come back and get something else.I came for lunch and got the lunch box special. Perhaps a mistake.I got the hot udon (meh) and there was nothing that special about the lunchbox. I'll even say that the vegetables that were included could have been excluded b/c they were just strange and not very tasty. The only vegetable I recognized was the carrot and the lotus root. The salad dressing was a little more vinegary than I'm used to, as was the soup base for the udon.If you go for lunch, I'd go with the lunch set. Next time I'm trying the soba noodles.The one delicious part of the meal was the little dessert that came out (I think as part of the lunch box). Silky, sweet tofu with lychee jelly on the bottom and strawberry sauce on the top.
Chris K.}New York, NY}168}105}61}-1}3}6/18/2009}Advice to self:1) continue your 2 breakfast routine (7am / 10am) so you don't:2) eat like a pregnant lady at lunch time.  i hate you food baby.Had I followed the said rules, I would have logically ordered the chewy and satisfying soba instead of:1) tuna tartar (beautifully constructed but disappointingly bland.  not fresh.)2) uni (midget portion) buried in grated japanese yam (flavorless, even with the wasabi)3) egg custard with mountain vegetables and chicken (creamy but TINY. served in a cup more appropriate for green tea.  2 mini chunks of uninspired chicken.  where are the veggies?) 4) simmered pork belly with poached egg (hearty but bristly pork redeemed only by the fatty broth and velvet-luscious egg of liquid gold.)  you haunt my dreams tonight egg i want to eat 12 of you. Total: $46, hungry and wishing for food baby.  Outside the restaurant I sheepishly apologize to my dinner companion.  "I'm sorry I ordered poorly...""It's ok.  We can just pretend it didn't happen?"   (sniff sniff) And off we went for liquid dessert.
Lucy M.}Brooklyn, NY}25}143}2}-1}4}6/9/2009}I've been here a couple of times and really enjoyed it. It is a little pricey for a bowl of noodles, as others have commented, but, hey, this is NYC so I guess I better start getting used to it. The food is delicious though, and the service is quite fast in my experience. I was very relieved to find pictures on the menu to guide my selection, though I think very little on the menu could disappoint me. I loved coming here in the winter time. Slurping down one of those giant bowls of noodles was like having the life breathed back into me. Will definitely be back again.
avi d.}New York, NY}18}115}0}-1}5}6/7/2009}the wait's a pain, the space cramped, but i dont think you can beat soba-ya for finding a great bowl of noodlessuper cute interior and excellent plating of dishes help reinforce to perceived authenticity of the place, but regardless if you're a serious japan-o-phile or just a hungry guy walking by the food's top notchcheap, filling, well seasoned dishes from various savory appetizers to the extensive soba and udon dishes (hot or cold) to smart desserts. I dont think i've had a dish here I havent liked and they dont make you feel gross afterwards which is often an issue for e. vil. noodle places.stand outs are the duck breast appetizer, the tasuta age, buta kakuni, and my personal favorite the kitsune udonif you go on a busy night there are plenty of bars to kill time at for the waits which invariably run 30mins to an hour. But once your seated you never feel rushedalways an excellent experience
C F.}New York, NY}2}161}4}-1}3}5/25/2009}I thought this place paled in comparison to Soba Koh and Soba Totto, although the portions were larger. I had the cold duck soba and tried my friend's tem soba, which had tasty tempura shrimp (one of the better tempura shrimps I've had in a while.) The duck was hard to chew and stiff, which really took a fair amount of delight out of the equation for me. The broth was alright, but 16 dollars for noodles and 5 pieces of tough-to-chew duck and $18 for tempura and noodles seems expensive. Also, if I hadn't already eaten a bbq dinner 2-3 hours beforehand, I would most definitely still be hungry.Maybe I have yet to understand the true appeal of soba because every time I go to a soba place, no matter how highly rated, I just look mournfully at the small portions. For my money, I would rather have pho or ramen any day of the week.
Lisa C.}New York, NY}24}27}0}-1}5}5/16/2009}This is as authentic of a Japanese "soba-ya" (literally noodle shop) as you can find in NY.  When you step in, everyone greets you in unison, something commonly done in almost any restaurant in Japan.  I went with a friend for dinner and ordered the cold Ikura (salmon roe) soba for $14.50.  This seems pricey for a bowl of noodles, but the texture of the noodles and the quality of all the ingredients make it worth the price.  In fact, i don't think the bowl of soba I had even at Matsugen is as good as the one I had here.  One bit of advice though, at Japanese restaurants that specializes in soba, I would get the cold version because I believe  you can get a better feel for the complexity of the noodle's texture when they are cold.Lastly, what's really unique about this restaurant is that the restroom is equipped with a high tech bidet toilet.  You know, the one that has a "warm water cleaning toilet seat".. If you don't know what that is, I suggest that you check it out the next time you go to Soba-ya :)

Daphne H.}San Francisco, CA}78}444}18}-1}5}4/25/2009Updatedreview}Ok so it was a HOT afternoon and I was thinking cold soba would be an excellent dinner option. So we came here to feast. I ordered the Ikura cold soba and he had the Uni soba both served cold. We had the tuna steak don to share...OMG, I cannot emphasize how much I love this tuna steak don. The buttery garlic flavour is enough for me to crave this yummy bowl of goodness :P Mmmm mmm..
Julina O.}東京都, Japan}159}64}1335}-1}5}4/15/2009}PERFECT JAPANESE LUNCH BOX with AUTHENTIC SOBA NOODLE!Ever since I can't remember I have eaten Soba noodle in Japan. So,I'm VERY picky and finicky about food, especially my comfort Japanese food "Soba noodle." Once I ate their Soba, which was not so hard and not so soft, was perfect that brought me back nostalgic memories! Oh My gosh--! super Oishii------(delicious)!!!!!My feelings was exactly like that the food critic, Anton Ego, was amazed by Remy's Rattatouille  at the Pixer movie "Ratatouille".No wonder, the ingredients of buckwheat came from my hometown Nagano, Japan.Not only their Soba noodle, but also their Lunch box, includes Nimono (simmered vegitables with JP soup stock and soy source), Dashimaki (JP omelette),Japanese style grilled Salmon and so on, was AWESOME! Waiter and waitress are also nice and very friendly.(and some of them are so cute!) I couldn't expect they serve perfect authentic Japanese food and special buckwheat hot water "SOBAYU" that almost made me cry...  I've had totally great experience at SOBAYA.Thank you, I REALLY LOVE YOU, SOBAYA!!!!
Helen C.}San Jose, CA}95}131}62}-1}4}4/7/2009}In the search for good Japanese food, Soba-ya fits right in.  It's not everyday that you find a soba shop with such variety.  If you're new to soba, don't be intimated.  Every menu item comes with a picture to help the newbies along.  The bento boxes and the daily specials are great options.  You have a choice of hot or cold for most soba dishes. Hot for the winter.  Cold for the summer.  Prices are reasonable given the quantity and quality of the food.  Lunch entrees range from $12-$20 and you won't leave hungry.Oh, also remember to try the desserts here.  The ice cream trio comes with yuzu, black sesame, and honey wasabi.  It's a lot creamier than the ice cream from Chinatown Ice Cream Factory and melts quickly.  I didn't get to try the green tea brulee, but if it's anything like the one at Gochi in San Jose, then it will be delicious!  Just another reason to return.
Tim M.}West Los Angeles, CA}9}235}19}-1}4}4/7/2009}Based on the yelp recommendations I got the duck soba.  I don't like duck and I didn't like this duck.  However the broth and noodles and everything else was delicious.  The service was good, but the prices were a little high for what it was.  They must be doing something right - it was packed on Sunday night at 9:30 during a recession
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}4}3/25/2009}I'd wanted to try this place for a while, and after a few planned visits aborted in the last couple months, I was able to stop in for dinner tonight.  I left with a feeling not unlike that of finally hooking up with a really hot guy, only to find that he kisses on the same level as all the other mortals - mostly happy but just a teeny tiny bit deflated.Let's stress the main feeling - mostly happy.  My brother and I split a buta kakuni appetizer, a kamonan soba, and a nabeyaki udonn.  We (I) ended the meal with a trio of honey wasabi, black sesame, and yuzu ice creams.  The buta kakuni was awesome.  I ended up cutting off some of the fat from the pork belly, as there was maybe a bit too much, but what made it past my throat/conscience was juicy, rich, and melty.  The broth with poached egg was deep and mellow, with a taste you want to roll on your tongue for hours.  The nabeyaki udon was also dead-on with perfectly cooked slippery udon noodles and a good mix of add-ins.As for the kamonan - this was the dish I was looking forward to most, and I wasn't impressed.  It wasn't bad, but the duck was a little tough, especially after that dreamy pork belly, and the broth had a sourness to it that I didn't love.  The soba noodles were still fantastic, and next time I might just go with simple cold soba and dipping sauce.  I was also disappointed in the ice cream.  The yuzu was the best of the three, perhaps because I haven't had an infinitely superior version at Sundaes & Cones, which was the case with both the black sesame and the wasabi.  The flavors of the latter two were not at all pronounced, and the consistency of the ice cream was too much ice and not enough cream.As for the other aspects of the restaurant - service was good, prices were somewhat steep, decor was understated and quaint, and the place got crowded fast.  We showed up right as they reopened for dinner at 5:30, along with a few other parties, and by the time we left, there was a bit of a line.So, verdict?  Well, I'm not about to marry the place, but who am I to turn down a perfectly good booty call.  Of course I'll be back.
Renee C.}New York, NY}42}175}0}-1}2}3/5/2009}after all the rave reviews here on yelp, soba-ya did not live up to my very high expectations.  hmmm.   perhaps my expectations were too high.  you see, i have a list of places i want to eat at/go to in NYC in the next year based on recommendation and soba-ya was one of them.  my friend and i ordered the tuna tartar for our appetizer.  yum!  my hopes soared and my anticipation heightened.  for my main dish, i ordered the hot duck soba noodle soup like others suggested.  waaahh it was so disappointing!  like someone else mentioned, the soup was a little sour, the duck was a little tough, and i was really not impressed with the dish as a whole.  i left the restaurant dejected and don't think i'll be coming back.  booo.
Mr. Met s.}Stony Brook, NY}78}346}513}-1}3}3/1/2009}SETTING: VERY Cramped, estimated 40 person capacity. However, very elegant & traditional looking place, very intimate, dim aura, and certainly a japanese feel. It looks like the restaurant takes up the whole building, but NOoooo upstairs is a nail salon or somethin'  This place is VERY BUSY. We came at 12pm(just opened) on Saturday, and 10 minutes later it was PACKED.FOOD: My hot Soba(i had the fried tofu cake thingy w/soba) was definitely home made, made perfect, with that "firm" feeling - definitely NOT soggy. A definite MUST try.However, it's $17 dollars(lunch special) for literally a handful of soba - it's just too crazy for excellent but unmemorable soba........BROTH: Definitely drinkable, not laced with msg. Try it with the soba in your mouth. *******Sorry, the food IS very good here, but the insane price really offsets the good feeling. I admit you must at least TRY this place ONCE. Maybe if i was loaded i Would definitely give this place FOUR stars, but I'm not.
David H.}Seattle, WA}49}52}22}-1}4}2/24/2009}Two words: Bento BoxI've been here twice while visiting NYC and I feel like this is some of the best Japanese food I've ever had. I love sushi but I also love the perfectly seasoned boiled vegetables that come in this box. The tamago like egg cake is seasoned perfectly. (You know they say you can tell a good sushi place by how well they prepare their tamago). The tempura was not too salty or oily. The salad was well, your standard salad with some kind of sesame dressing. The salmon was well cooked and not too firm either.I also had the cold soba noodles with my box. They make the noodles in front of everyone and I felt like I could really taste the difference in the way they made their noodles in house. The sweet tofu dish with a strawberry on top was an excellent way to finish off the meal.
Alex C.}San Francisco, CA}108}168}243}-1}2}2/21/2009}Zagat Award? Check. Yelp favorite? Check. New York Magazine, NY Times, Time Out New York, Village Voice Article, and Frank Bruni recommended? Check, Check, Check, Check and Check!Really? Are you serious? This can't be right. I ordered exactly what this place was known for, Kamonan (duck and scallion) with soba noodles. First thing I noticed was that it was covered in oil. Then I tried the soup. It was sour. The scallions? Raw. The slices of duck? Bingo, at least they did something right.The nabeyaki udon dish however, was done right. The soup was intricately flavored, the udon was cooked to the perfect consistency and the whole dish was nicely presented. I'm tempted to come back and try the cold soba dishes and hoping that tonight was just a fluke.
Emi T.}Glenmont, NY}3}107}15}-1}2}2/13/2009}The broth is way too salty.  I confess that I actually poured water into my soba, just so I could eat it.  I'd rather have other people think I'm a freak than die of dehydration.  It's sad, because the noodles themselves are really good, and the broth would taste good too if only they diluted it to a normal level.
Brad M.}Woodside, NY}148}92}0}-1}4}2/7/2009}I fantasize about the tuna  tekka-don at Soba-ya. And when I finally succumb to my desire the wait for a table drives me bananas. For some reason, I'm always so disappointed by the wait here and get super impatient. Maybe I'm just jealous of the people who are already seated but probably half the times I go to Soba-ya I end up huffily walking away from the line and eating at Rairaiken.
mOmO B.}New York, NY}66}62}172}-1}4}2/2/2009}I have rather mixed feelings about this place- I've been to Soba-ya twice and eating here can be a zen like experience if you fancy origami like precision in your food- i'd think those who would enjoy this place most is the kind of people who love to buy cute stationary /stickers  with cute pens, clicky lead pencils  with a matching pencil case stored neatly in the bookbag each in designated pockets..etc.  For me- eating at Soba-ya  kinda felt like eating in a library, almost as if i were to chew too loudly id be shushed. Theres also a sign that instructs patrons to "SHUT OFF CELL PHONE", which is enforced strictly-  it was frowned upon when a  phone started to ring at another table. The food here isnt cheap- the bill for a party of 2 have tally'd up to over 100 bux both of my visits. For noodles and small dishes its quite pricey.. however these arent just noodles.. they are hand drawn soba noodles.. probably made right on the spot after ordering- carefully measured into a predetermined amount of broth with just the precise amount of salt down to the very last detail. Something about the formula in how things are done at Sobaya feels almost robotic- To fully enjoy a meal here i really had to sink into the mood. What you will get is a very nutritious meal that really feels healthy for you - dishes like the salmon belly wass imppecably fresh. I had the duck soba in soup and even though its been nearly a year apart since my last visit- it looked and tasted EXACTLY like the previous time I had it. Flavors tend to be quite mild and natural for all the offerings on the menu.The portions here are not big- so if you are a big eater expecting to leave with a food baby this isnt the place for you. - The deserts are also worth a try- note they are also very *cute*. It seems that everything we eat these days is in some way over the top-overly salty/ sweet/ spiced/ fat/  fried/ charred/ deccadant - what describes the norm of our meal is based on things like- biggest/ oldest/ cheapest/ priciest/ most reviews *irony*. Rarely do we get to enjoy a meal where upon leaving the door our body would say thank you.. however after the meal at Soba-ya  i truly believe your body will thank you.
Smog R.}San Francisco, CA}33}113}18}-1}5}2/1/2009}Dear everyone who recommended the duck soba, You are angels.This was one of the best meals eaten by anyone ever.With each and every spoonful, I was surprised anew by the deliciousness of the broth.  The slices of duck were luscious and fantastic.Wow.  Wow.  Wow.I think I am spoiled for all other bowls of noodles for forever.Sigh....
Paul D.}Wellington, New Zealand}79}316}15}-1}4}1/21/2009}Just a short review. The duck soup with soba rocked the world. Honestly, the tastiest dish I have had in I do not know how long - which is a long time in the grander scheme of things. The rich, clear flavors of the broth were so fantastic.You should go, its awesome.
Susanna W.}Palo Alto, CA}245}639}74}-1}4}1/19/2009}Soba-ya New YorkCold winter night, Hot duck soupMm yum delicious
Shmalex D.}Brooklyn, NY}6}12}4}-1}4}1/16/2009}This place rules ass. I came here before with a couple friends and got the Nabeyaki Udon because I was craving some udon. It had a really tasty broth but other than that it was pretty much your average udon. Today I went around 5:45 before the rush (they open at 5:30 for dinner). I ordered the cold soba noodles with the duck dipping sauce which had some tasty pieces of leek, scallion and duck in it. The soba noodles were out of control good, I don't know what I was thinking the last time I got udon. I asked the server which dessert he recommended and he said the yam pudding. It was awesome! If you come here, go for the soba and not the udon. They make the noodles themselves and they are delicious. The only reason I give in four stars instead of five is that it was a bit overpriced at fifteen dollars.
Dennis C.}Singapore, Singapore}91}244}49}-1}4}1/12/2009}Really liked this place.  I can't remember the name of it, but we started with a dish that featured chopped raw tuna rolled in yuba bean curd.  The roll is sliced like sushi, and placed on top of a fantastic, slightly spicy guacamole, with pieces of shredded fried yam sprinkled generously on top.I then had the hot tororo soba - Japanese grated yam along with boiled spinach.  The broth was rich and tangy, I think flavored with the yam.  Dessert might have been my favorite part - I had the milk tofu, which I can't describe too well but is a must-have.  The restaurant is decently sized but very cozy, and the service was very friendly.  Also, I saw Maggie Gyllenhaal, with whom I've been in love since the Dark Knight, there.
Oliver C.}Berlin, Germany}74}27}72}-1}4}1/11/2009}I had the lunch special which included hot hand made Soba Noodles and a box of goodies including some Tempura, pickled vegetables, one piece of cold chicken, salad, a tofu/sticky rice roll and more. I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere and I can see why this place is popular. The bill for 4 people was about $75.
Dena S.}Portland, OR}63}148}0}-1}3}1/10/2009}Was looking forward to trying Soba-ya based on a recommendation from a friend - however, if you don't eat seafood this restaurant can be a bit challenging, as all the broth they have is fish flavored.  I did enjoy the soba noodle salad and the house made noodles were amazing.  I also tried the cold soba sesame noodles and they were good as well - but I left feeling a bit unsatisfied and I am not sure I would go back.
Jeff C.}New York, NY}1142}1258}14}-1}5}1/5/2009Updatedreview}Ode to Soba-Ya's duck soba...Dirty babeYou see the shacklesBaby I'm your slaveI'll let you whip me if I misbehaveIt's just that no one makes me feel this wayCame back to try the sashimi and the duck soba, along with my other favorites from last time. The sashimi is quite a bargain for what they give you. They are generous w/ the portion size for the combo sashimi. The fluke was very good too. The tuna sashimi was just OK. The duck soba was so addictive, words cannot describe such jizzmatism. I usually prefer my duck served crispy w/ skin on, but I made an exception with ease this time because the broth was so damn flavorful!! I don't care if the tempura soba is the most popular dish here, I can eat tempura anytime! The duck is where it's at homies! Only 5pcs boo! I could eat bottomless portions of this! Coupled with their killer soba, you'll be hanging out w/ Kurt Cobain in Nirvana baby!!! I also tasted the chestnut creme brulee this time. It was good, but not great. P.S. Hasaki has the best Hijiki..period, not Tsukushi or here. That Olympics is officially over!!!I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT SOBA-KOH TASTES LIKE IF IT'S BETTER THAN HERE....I JUST (PROVERBIALLY) NUTTED IN MY PANTS THINKING ABOUT IT!!!UPDATE: 02/10/09. Soba Koh's cold soba is the BEST.
George L.}New York, NY}82}135}0}-1}5}12/30/2008}Alright dudes and dudettes this was a good one.  Lets see, I was with my family and we came in around 7.  No problem sitting down.  Everything was clean and the place was cute and japanesy.  It seemed pretty authentic the atmosphere and food and service.  They gave our sashimi 1st, maybe thats just the way they d things (before the appetisers) anyway it was yellow tail.  Freaking awesome slice of fish they have.  I have eaten alot of sashimi and this is one of the best.  Maybe they just had a great batch that day but anyway it was really good.  So good we ordered it again!  I don't like wasabi but one of my family members pointed out that they use freshly made wasabi!  I tasted it taste richer than the normal wasabi but still not my thing but the rest of my fam was really loving it.  So I got the Egg with chicken custard for a appetizers the rest of my family had the cod fish and the darn I think it was somekind of egg with with soup and mushroom thing.  Anyway  wish was very very tasty and the soup thing was super awesome tasting!  The custard was alright I don't recommend it, nothing too special.  For my main meal I got the Kinoko, it was hot soba noodles in soup with duck and kinoki mushrooms (i think tahst how you spell it).  That was delicious!!  The soba noodles were amazing and i'm not even that big of a fan.  I'm more of a udon guy (which they also have here).  I figured try it because the place is called "Soba-Ya" for a reason.  The duck meat was delicious.  I didn't get to try anyone elses but everyone loved their meal and one person had Soba beer which I thought was cool.  (sorry didn't get dessert I was stuffed =D) Best part is that the place offers a amazing price for how much food you get and the great quality. Soba-Ya you did fine!!
John T.}New York, NY}8}44}0}-1}4}12/23/2008}This is one of my staple Japanese restaurants that I go to. I occasionally treat myself to their dishes every now and again. I believe I started eating there in 2004. The entrees are delectable, and the desserts are even more so. I cannot recommend a single dish, but as far as I know, most of them have been quite good. It all depends on your preference. The noodles themselves are firm and soft at the same time. Having cold soba noodles in the Summer is definitely a treat. For those who are looking for a bargain, arrive for lunch and order the bento box. It's large and has a good number of compartments filled with a variety of a la cart food. In addition to that, you get a bowl of their noodles in broth. But after eating so much, it would be a shame not to have room for dessert.Personally, I take my friends here just to try the homemade ice cream. All of the flavors have their own personality. From the sweet vanilla topped with red bean, to the pleasant yuzu, the mature black sesame, surprisingly rebellious honey wasabi, and the ever necessary green tea, they are all outstanding in their quality and flavor. I favor the honey wasabi coupled with the black sesame. They compliment each other very well. The green tea ice cream is for green tea lovers. I find the flavor to be overwhelming for my own tastes.  But it is no mistake that you cannot get this anywhere else except Sobaya. The other desserts are good in their own right, however, I feel that the ice cream is in a tier above them.The setting is very similar to a traditional looking Japanese tea house, of course without the specific dimensions and the tatami floor mats. The wood and soft light echos a warm feeling. It is a great setting for an intimate dinner with friends or a significant other. The atmosphere is... lively. The restaurant is always seemingly busy which provides hushed chatter as white noise. It also doesn't hurt that the bathrooms are exceptionally clean and fresh smelling. Overall, the entire experience is optimized for your eating pleasure.
Keiko G.}Brooklyn, NY}306}35}4}-1}4}12/19/2008}One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in New York City. Their soba is fresh and delicious. My mom is Japanese, and we go here (and Chiyoda Sushi) every time she's in town. The atmosphere is great too. Very clean and quiet. And they have one of those Japanese robot toilets. It has buttons that will wash your bum.The sesame (or goma) tofu is AMAZING.One star off because I wish they had more soba options that doesn't contain deep-fried somethings.
waisum t.}New York, NY}35}72}0}-1}5}12/16/2008}If you want fresh soba this is the place to go. It is unpretentious. The only downside is there is sometimes a bit of a wait.  But I love their soba.    I've brought several friends here, and now it's one of their favorite restaurants.
Pamela S.}Brooklyn, NY}53}177}0}-1}4}12/16/2008}Been here a few times, have sat at the bar each time, good soba.  I always enjoy going...   Their menu has a lot of choices and I often feel overwhelmed with my indecisiveness, everything I've gotten has been very good.
Loretta H.}San Francisco, CA}10}95}22}-1}4}12/11/2008}I am not a Soba expert, but their Soba is consistent and dependable.  They serve very unpretentious good tasting food.Noodle soup is one of my favorite meal and Soba is definitely a good break from the usual Ramen or Chinese Noodle Soups.  Soba-ya has tons and tons of choices.  I love both their Cold and Hot Soba.  My favorite one is Kamo - cooked duck and sauteed scallion which is a Hot Soba option.Their lunch menu is also good as well.  It's not exactly cheap though, but there is a lot of food to make up for it.
Michael S.}Castro Valley, CA}15}226}22}-1}3}12/9/2008}I was desperately in need of soup noodles int the am after a fierce night of drinking. It is my hangover ritual that has been celebrated for the last 10 years. It used to be Pho when I lived in California, but now that I am in NY and Pho is terrible it has become Nippon noodles. I am growing tired of Ramen so I jumped into Soba-ya for something different.I feel so amateur now because I ordered Udon at Soba-ya. I was still in a haze the the punishing my liver absorbed 8 hours earlier and wasn't fully aware of where I was eating. Next time Soba for sure.Udon lunch box was pretty boring. Udon noodle in soup which is what i wanted, but it was forgettable. Tempura was pretty good. Grilled piece of salmon was so dry I couldn't eat it, but i did love the boiled veggies. They were braised in something sweet too. But i like mush veggies.I will go back and get Soba next time and update this review.
Laur T.}New York, NY}26}780}0}-1}4}12/7/2008}Wow... the much talked-about soba-ya.I was here a little earlier than my dinner companion. It was cold, so I checked-in at the restaurant. To prevent unnecessary queuing later on when my friend arrived, I placed my name down and informed the hostess that I would probably need a table 30-40 mins later (I didn't want to hoard the table and since table turns are prime opportunities for restaurants) . To my surprise, she asked if I would like to be seated right away. oh well.We aren't big fans of soba in hot broth so went with our typical  zaru soba which was good. In addition to that, we ordered a bunch of appetizers:- Uni Tororo- Boiled spinach- Sukui tofu- Tuna tartare- KampyoFood was good, nice interior. They have a happy hour pre-fixe from 530-7 but I'd much rather go for a la carte since I usually share my noodle dish and am a bigger fan of the accompanying sides.
Mugwump S.}New York, NY}5}54}0}-1}5}12/3/2008}it took me 3 years of my friend's attempts at convincing me to go there before i finally capitulated to his nagging. the major reason being that i am no longer a broke student. i am a corporate whore now, and i make money.what i'm trying to say is that i was reluctant to splurge on a $15 soba noodle soup. but oh, how mistaken i was! their soups are just simply amazing. the noodles taste good and you can tell the difference between freshly made noodles and the rest. the broth is simply marvelous in the simple complexity of its aroma and flavours. their soups strike me as what i would assume to be purist. i don't feel like any unnecessary garnishing or ingredients are included.if you're into ginseng, their ginseng soup is really tasty. and so is their duck soup. i once had a seasonal matsutake soup which was delicious too. and i've tried and enjoyed all of their ice cream flavours, including the wasabi one. haven't ventured into their appetisers yet, though.and for those of you who are still skeptical, just cross the street and head over to sharaku and have their soba soup to taste the justified difference in price (love their sushi, though).
Brittany H.}Santa Monica, CA}1037}631}254}18}3}11/21/2008}i was really in the mood for udon... soba-ya actually offered udon noodles....but i don't think they were freshly made.  If anything, this place is suppose to be known for their soba.  So the choice was pretty clear...i just HAD TO try their soba noodles!Disclaimer - I don't ever typically order soba noodles...I'm more of an udon noodles type of gal, but i'm always up for anything new and will try anything once.  I ordered the soba w/ tempura.  While the noodles were super fresh & the soup was light & consistent, I thought the tempura lacked flavor.  I think a pinch of salt would have done the trick.  Overall, I liked my soup a lot.  No complaints.   However, soba noodles aren't my thing...so I'm going to have to try their other dishes.... I don't think I'd be craving this anytime soon, unless it was udon noodles.
Preethi C.}Manhattan, NY}582}536}102}-1}3}11/11/2008}I had dinner here tonight & was somewhat disappointed.  After all the great reviews and all the stickers posted on the establishment touting recommendations from Zagat and Michelin, I thought this place might be something special.Well, the food wasn't bad, but I found it somewhat overpriced and lackluster.  Also, the ambiance was not very nice - yes, the restaurant has a pretty, zen-like decor - but it was uncomfortably warm in there and it was so crowded that waiters were bumping into patrons, who were bumping into other patrons, etcService was not very good.  Water wasn't brought to our table until I asked and the food arrived at our table very slowly (after an attempt was made to give us the wrong dish).We ordered the Pork Belly w/ Poached Egg & an Udon noodle soup w/ a mix of chicken and seafood (forgive me for forgetting the actual names in Japanese).  The Pork Belly was a delicious, greasy, fatty, eggy, porky bowl of goodness.  The noodle soup was (in my opinion) over smoked and bland.  There was very little meat to it - two small chunks of chicken, one piece of shrimp, and one small piece of fishcake - all for $18.50 - damn!  At least the Pork Belly was only $10, and there are some reasonably priced sake options.I think we probably should have tried the soba noodles, which the restaurant is supposed to be known for, but we were in the mood for different things.  What we ordered was decent, but not worth the price, uncomfortable atmosphere, and so-so service.Note: Does not take reservations.  We went on a weekday, and although there were a lot of people, we were seated immediately.
Billy C.}Bayonne, NJ}242}242}49}-1}4}11/11/2008}Monday night, party of 5, 6:30pm, no reservations waited about 20 minutes.  Found street parking right in front of the restaurant quite easily.Typical Japanese ambiance, simple, serene and comfortable.What was ordered.Appetizer:- Uni Tororo ($9.50) - Fresh California Sea Urchin & Grated Japanese Yam - Next time I will just order Uni Sashimi as the Grated Yam didn't do much for me.Appetizer Nibble: (Courtesy of Jeff C.)- Hijiki ($5.50) - Cooked Hijiki Seaweed and Vegetables - Good taste and texture- Ankimo - Monkfish Liver - Reminded me of foie gras.- Seared Salmon Belly - Melts in your mouth not in your hands.Main Course:- Ikura Soba (Cold) - Wow!  The texture of the soba was extra al dente and the ikura was not too salty.  Very delicious.  I will have to try the cold udon noodles next time.Main Course Nibble:- Gindara - Broiled Cod Fish Marinated with Sake Lees - Broiled to perfection, so fresh, so tender so delightful, literally melts upon contact with your tongue.Dessert:- Milk tofu with strawberry syrup - Nice subtle flavors but nothing noteworthy.I will definitely be back.  Definitely give Soba Totto a run for its money.Verdict: Yay, I'm a fan!I highly recommend it.
Steve C.}Bellerose, NY}85}166}51}-1}4}11/10/2008}Great soba. I had the hot tempura soba and the soup was really light and earthy. Noodles was just firm enough and the wheat flour gave it that "YAY I'm eating healthy" feeling. The 3 shrimp tempura was OK but nothing special. Next time I'll order the plain soba and get a side dish.I had the Ika Meshi (squid stuffed with sticky rice) which was alright. But some of the other sides looked much better. The broiled cod was a big piece and was raved about. Salmon Belly and Pork Belly both looked very tasty and filling.I had a taste of the wasabi ice cream and it was really good. It had some kick but was also refreshing. I can't wait to go back.
amy p.}New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}3}11/7/2008}I have been going here for almost 10 years. The food is great and the prices not bad. However, i feel that they are out of hit and not in touch with their customers. I eat here almost once a week and they never seem to remember me or give us special anything etc.. I am considering becoming a regular somewhere else because of this. Lack of attention to regulars is not a good thing!!!
AJ K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}28}0}-1}4}11/5/2008}This one will be quick, like my afternoon lunch there last week.I came in at the tail end of lunch service, and was expecting to be turned away, but they seated me anyway. They were extremely polite, and it was very nice to see that they made their own fresh noodles on site, I could taste the difference. Menu was very diverse for a small spot, and I couldn't decide what I wanted. A friend and I had some soba, and then I chose a daily special as well, (stupidly can't remember what it was called) and it was awesome. It was an Udon bowl with tamago (egg custard of some sort), shrimp tempura (the whole small shrimp kind) fish cake, some delicious seaweed, and much more. They also brought japanese pickles with the Udon, very nice. There was this great rolled up green leafy vegetable in there that I loved, or was it seaweed? I had no idea what it was but I'll be back to try it again. I thought the broth was really the strong point at Soba Ya, light, not over salty, and properly flavored. This is how I wanted my broth to be, and they were successful in imparting all the flavors in a good broth but without the salty, cloying, thickness of lesser quality broth.I was also impressed at the selection of some pretty good sakes from Soba Ya. I always enjoy a good sake, and although they were mostly the usual suspects from the major distributors, I was happy to have the option to drink quality sake instead of the total junk they offer at the average asian establishment of today. Overall I would rate Soba Ya as a great spot. It was fairly priced, had good atmosphere, good service, and a really nice menu. I'll be back for another quick lunch soon and I'll update my post then.
Ana A.}Ann Arbor, MI}7}19}0}-1}4}11/2/2008}Totally delicious. Good place to go when you crave the simplicity and goodness of Japanese but don't want sushi. Would recommend for a low-key night out, post movie dining or afternoon pick me up. Generous portions - my $13.50 soba noodle bowl is easily three meals. Curry udon highly recommended. Service is quick. They serve genmaicha tea vs. regular green tea. Lots of sake options and a few Japanese beers available too. Lastly - as someone who can be a bit of a ball of nerves, I found the simplicity and vibe of this place truly comforting and relaxing.
Miriam W.}San Francisco, CA}3141}3141}2255}18}4}10/21/2008}If you appreciate the supreme seasonality of Japanese food, you'll love Soba-ya. Sunday afternoon is definitely the time to head to this East Village noodle house. You'll avoid the crowds and you can get the $15 Lunch Box, which is definitely the best deal at Soba-ya.Also, don't miss the:Goma Ae; boiled spinach mixed with sesame sauceMaguro-Don;  fresh tuna or marinated tuna sashimi over rice
Thierry S.}New York, NY}25}141}0}-1}4}10/19/2008}Noodles freshly made on site with great broth and ingredients. Shouldn't be so hard but so few are able to get it right. This is heaven on earth for noodle lovers... especially when its cold outside.  Over the years, the menu has expanded, thankfully for us repeat visitors, to include more variety to accompany those gorgeous noodles.  The seating is a bit tight but comfortable and strangely (cause I can't put my finger on it after 10 years) refined in its feeling. While the restaurant is often full, the wait is never too long.
Lin H.}New York, NY}75}255}2}-1}4}10/12/2008}Walking in here was like finding a quiet, cozy oasis after all the hubbub on St. Marks. As soon as we sat down, we were offered some warm moist towels to wipe our hands. The green tea was really earthy and the soba noodles were very fresh. Yum. A nice healthy, satisfying meal.Very convenient that the hostess will call your cell when your table is ready.
Grant C.}New York, NY}95}446}205}-1}4}10/9/2008}Great soba.  The broth is tasty, the noodles are perfect, and the ingredients are always fresh.  (Some of them are a little scary, though; those fish cakes are about the most horrible thing I've ever had in my mouth, and that includes the time I swallowed a bug while riding my bike.)  Nice space; very Japanese.  The service is usually pretty good, though I was pretty pissed when I tried to bring a friend here after raving about the place.  We came in half an hour before closing and they refused to seat us.  (See Lili Z.'s review; guess we're not the only ones this has happened too.)
Princess M.}New York, NY}34}337}591}-1}4}9/25/2008}GREAT soba.I love this place.  It totally hits the spot whenever I crave for comforting food that I know is healthy.Their soba is handmade so there's a gourmet touch, but the atmosphere and service makes this place very approachable and comfortable as a place that you can visit all the time.The first time I tried this place, I felt everything was bland.  But I've definitely grown to appreciate the simplicity of their food and it's definitely NOT bland.  It's very cleansing but also very filling and comforting.They have daily specials.  My favorite noodle dishes are the ones with eel tempura, regular tempura, sake mizore (broiled salmon flakes, salmon roe and radish), ikura, sakuraebi seiro or the sansai soba.  For rice bowls, I also enjoy their katsu-oyako don and their salmon ikura don.  Their cold soba is my staple in the hot summers and their hot soba is my staple on rainy days and during the winter.  Note that their 'udon' is thinner than the usual thick udon noodles you see.They also have lunch specials, which are really excellent deals as you can order a big bento box with a lot of variety or you can order a soba and rice set from a variety of combinations.  It's a lot of food!This place has become a staple for me and my friends.  Note that it does get quite crowded but you may put your name and phone number down and roam the neighborhood while waiting for your table.
Lani N.}Chicago, IL}156}170}14}-1}4}9/10/2008}Soba-ya only has one truly vegetarian option, the soba salad.  All of the soups are served with a meat-based broth, which was a bummer.  The soba slad is a cold dish as the name suggests, but that's not a bad thing.  It's very refreshing, so I've actually come back a few times for it.Soba-ya gets really busy, even on weeknights.  On Saturdays, it will be empty around 8:00.  Then everyone seems to bum rush in at 8:30 and if you're at the end of the bum rush, you'll have to wait 45-50 minutes for a table.And true story, I saw Terry Richardson eat here with his lady friend.
Mindy Y.}New York, NY}1183}181}142}-1}4}8/31/2008}I'm so lucky! I live so close to Soba-ya that I should be going more often... during off peak hours because the line that forms at around 7 until 10 is too much for even a piggy like me. I love their authentic Japanese cooking. The tempura soba is my favorite. The broth is a little lovely... a little smoky. Even the green tea is amazing.
Peter S.}New York, NY}457}59}4}-1}5}8/24/2008}Went to Sobya-ya last night with my parents. We just came back from a two month trip to Japan, and this restaurant made us feel like we were back there again. I was pretty sick of Soba, so I ordered Japanese Yam (yummy), Tempura (too much -- delicious), Roasted Duck (cold, hammy, tasty), and Hijiki (best i've ever had). My parents both ordered a rice bowl and a bowl of Soba. It was just as good as the best places we went to in Japan. We had way too much food, but will definitely be back. The lunch specials look like a great deal. Will go with a friend soon.
Ji A.}New York, NY}3}27}0}-1}5}8/22/2008}Love it! Best shrimp tempura I have ever had and the lunch specials are always delicious and huge portions. A little bit pricey for noodles, but I would go everyday. Some times there is a long wait, but its worth it. I have tried the box special, pork katsu don, and the hot duck soba soup. My favorite is the pork katsu don. It's like hot fatty pork with the right amount of eggs and onion. You wont be disappointed here!
mi m.}San Francisco, CA}5}159}15}-1}5}8/21/2008}Sobaya prepares traditional Japanese food simply, creatively and deliciously!  Every time I go to New York it is a must stop.  The service is great and the food fresh and wonderful.
Diana N.}NY, NY}73}646}0}-1}4}8/14/2008}I love the soba here, but I often end up ordering the nabyaki, which only comes with udon.  The food here is quite delicious, and I enjoy their desserts.  Recently tried the macha brulee.  Yummy green tea goodness.  They don't take reservations, so if you are going with a big group, it's better to get there early.  It usually gets really busy around 7pm on weekends.  Service is impeccable and if you get one of the booth seating, it's quite cozy.
Lisa N.}San Clemente, CA}342}144}168}-1}5}8/9/2008}Grade: A+One of my favorite NYC restaurants - it is a must visit! A few friends recommended this place to me, and I am so glad for it! Love their soba and sashimi! I ordered regular soba and sashimi (salmon). Very fresh, very tasty.  Their green tea is delicious too!  Can't wait to head back!
Grace T.}New York, NY}191}17}0}-1}4}8/7/2008}I've had quite a few meals here, and usually order the soba lunch set. It's huge and very good, but I wish that the fish was not cooked so dry and the vegetables a little fresher. The service could be somewhat friendlier. The decor is very nice, and I can get some sense of what Japan might be like.
drew d.}Los Angeles, CA}18}42}11}-1}4}8/3/2008}This was last day in the NYC and we saluted farewell at Soba-Ya! The food was fresh and tasty. Reasonable lunch prices! The soba was excellent and helped to brighten the dreary new york day and more importantly helped to ease the mother fucking "China Bus" ride home! In which the bus ac was broke!  To top it off I was sitting next to the heater! On a full noisy bus next to fucking annoying wanna be hipster, rapper, comic book loving,  star wars porno students. They annoyed the fuck out me. But yo. i remembered that i had some good food right before my 3+ hours bus ride on hell!    But really eat here you won't regret it. especially if you must endure the pain that i went through. i wish i could have smacked that one guy with his stupid chrome messenger bag! LAME!
GarGuPi L.}Flushing, NY}81}493}1452}-1}3}7/27/2008}3.5 stars. Came here for a special lunch today. The only reason I came is really for the homemade soba.  Of course, the lunch set ($15) was a given.  Good portion, but the small sides weren't big surprises (simmered burdock, lotus and such).  Tempura was fresh, but of course the star was the soba.  We ordered a side of hot soba and the texture was nice and fresh.  I ordered the tororo lunch set.  I was surprised I couldn't get the tororo on the zaru soba instead of the rice, since that's one of the dinner options. So I had to skim the tororo from the rice to the soba.  I love tororo, but I was a bit diappointed, maybe because the dashi has overpowered the natural taste.  Though I must compliment the soba again. And I love the rice-water that came at the end of the meal.  Very resfreshing. Price-wise, it's not cheap, but in Japanese standard, it's not too expensive.  But with the lunch box, plus tax and tips, it'll run you $20 a lunch meal, so it's really more like a treat.  Service was average.  I got my water and tea when asked, but I felt a bit rushed to place my order.  And to think I could've had a more serene experience there. I felt more like being in a harried Chinese restaurant.  The weekdays would probably be better.
Ryan F.}Washington, OR}15}39}1}-1}5}7/8/2008}Easily one of my favorite restaurants in New York.  The soba is consistently exemplary, the service is super-professional and courteous, and the interior is woody and brightly cozy.  What really elevates this place, other than the soba, though, are the myriad small dishes of delicacies you simply don't find in other Japanese restaurants in New York.  I'm not even going to list them.  Go to Sobaya and be surprised.  My favorite dish on the whole menu is a Chirashi soba, served cold.  It involves tamago-yaki, baby-shrimp tempura, marinated mushrooms, yuba, kitsune, and other treats over cold noodles.  You can only get on the weekend, which is tragic, but it feels like a special occasion when you do manage to order it.Their seasonal sake list is also excellent.
Ingrid C.}San Francisco, CA}366}585}207}-1}5}7/5/2008}I love Soba-Ya! I was originally taken here during college, for their very reasonably-priced lunchtime sets. There's SO MUCH FOOD, and it's all so good! Usually, I'm not the type of person who raves about the amount of food you get, but it's so impressive here, considering the high level of overal quality. I haven't had a soba I didn't like from here. Everyone I've ever taken has liked it, too! I even took my dad and his family here, and they wanted to come back again! He's got two kids, and they love noodles, and the staff was very friendly with them. My vegetarian friends can always find something to their liking, as well. Dinner is more appropriately portioned. Appetizers look small, but they're artfully done, and delicious. Dinner's also more expensive, but still well within reason, in my opinion. They're nice if you have to wait for a table, as well. They'll take your phone number and call you repeatedly in order to make sure you get your chance. I missed their first two phone calls (my phone was in my pocket), and they called after a few more minutes, so I still got my table. Get dessert. I'm always happy with their black sesame ice cream, but I'm still sad they no longer have their chestnut parfait. Their milk jello with the macerated strawberry is good, too. Good sake list, too. I'm just a little sad they don't have their English-translated names (always fun with sake), but that's a tiny complaint.
julian d.}New York, NY}2}20}4}-1}2}6/30/2008}expect a long wait because the noodles here are really good, that's undeniable. no points deducted for the wait :) points awarded for yummy noodles ;)i was VERY disappointed with our awful server, over-priced/under-portioned, and the so-so ambiance.
C.J. T.}New York, NY}37}248}50}-1}5}6/27/2008}One of my favecomfort food spots. I love the nabeyaki udon! The noodles have just the right amount of chewiness and the broth is savory and not too salty - perfect for cold winter days (or any other day, really). I like to bring my foodie friends here for a reasonably priced, relaxing early dinner.Sobaya is a smaller-sized restaurant, great for small groups of 2-6. Any groups bigger than that will have a really hard time squeezing in, so keep it simple, people. The place is popular and they don't take reservations, so regardless of how many people you bring be prepared to wait 10-45 minutes at dinnertime (perhaps more on weekends). Of course, you could do the smart thing and come during non-peak hours, in which case you may not have to wait at all. Late lunch, anyone?P.S. Their bathroom has one of those fancy, high-tech Japanese toilets. If you've never used one before, just take it from me and do NOT try pressing buttons to see what they do.
Judy W.}Elmhurst, NY}48}15}1}-1}5}6/21/2008}Simple and quick eats.  Excellent Soba.  Good Saki list.
Yaahmee T.}San Francisco, CA}9}65}0}-1}3}6/17/2008}After weeks of watching my roommate down soba night after night, I decided I needed some.  She recommended Sobaya, knowing the statement "and they have wasabi ice cream", would lure me in.  Since I'm no soba connoisseur I'll just talk about what I really care about:  the black sesame, wasabi, and something something ice cream.Excited for wasabi ice cream, but ended up loving the black sesame.  Wasabi was a disappointment.  After experiencing gelato flavors like celery root and fresh ginger in Venice, I was hoping the wasabi would provide the same taste bud glory of eating a non-chocolate, non-fruity, non-generic tasting dessert.  It was just too overpowering and the sweetness of the ice cream couldn't cut through the power.  Of course I finished it, hoping I would adjust to the intensity of the wasabi but nay, I am a weakling. Boo hoo me.
Angela L.}San Francisco, CA}61}243}113}-1}3}5/28/2008}was the soba good? sure. is it worth the $15-18? hell no. not to mention the $4 red bean dessert bun the size of a golf ball. the quality of food is definitely there, plus it comes out right after you order, but sorry I'd rather buy my own udon/soba and feed a family for the same price. the service wasn't the best, and they sure know how to be pushy and ask you to leave when there are other folks waiting. sorry sobaya, I had high hopes for you as I love soba, but you're not worth the wait.
Allen Y.}Brooklyn, NY}14}47}0}-1}5}5/22/2008}I'm a huge fan of this place. I've been here at least 5 times. The lunch specials usually leave me so full that I'm ready to bust a gut. Everything is just so good here that I just can't stop eating everything.I've always ordered the hot noodles here since I'm not a fan of cold noodles. The agadashi tofu is heavenly, a nice slight crunch on the outside and soft in the inside. I've also ordered the rice bowls with tuna or salmon. They give you a good healthy portion of fish here. The one minor criticism I have is the seasoning of the rice. There's a bit too much rice vinegar in it.The service is good and I hear Japanese being spoken amongst the customers. I can only guess that's a good sign....
Stephanie L.}San Francisco, CA}78}174}0}-1}4}5/20/2008}noodles here are amazing.  can't wait to come back here.  i had roast duck soba, holy crap it was so good.  despite the fact that i think i could actually feel my blood vessels becoming turgid in my body from hypertension, i couldn't help but suck down every last drop of broth until i was in a complete sodium coma.  anyway, also they have real life toto washlets in the bathrooms!  talk about authenticity.  made me feel like i was really in japan.  plus, there's nothing like sitting down on a curiously but comfortably warm toilet seat and pondering water spray options as you do your business.    i think my eyes actually lit up when i pushed open the door to the bathroom and i saw the toilet.  pretty exciting stuff.
Scott R.}Austin, TX}296}784}12}-1}3}5/15/2008}Lovely Japanese restaurant - the walls are paper-thin and everything! - that specializes in Soba and Udon noodles.Came here for lunch.  Went with one of the lunch boxes - $15 for soba and a bento box of identifiable (salmon) and unidentifiable (?) items.I know Yelpers love this place but it didn't do much for me past the zen/tranquility.   Soba was Soso.  The bento box stuff was okay I guess.I'll give it 5 stars for ambience but b/w the meal and price, I'm giving it 3 stars.  I'd go back but only if someone really wanted to go...
Carl C.}Brooklyn, NY}25}153}3}-1}5}5/10/2008}For soba this is the real thing. I loves me some buckwheat noodles and this places does them japanese proper. Both the cold and hot soba are wonderfully prepared. Also their Uni and Yam appetizer is something to try out a real treat.
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}5}5/2/2008}I've been here three times - two times for dinner and once for lunch.Expect to wait for dinner. The wait is usually around 30 minutes. They will call you when your table is ready so you can wander around the area. I think there may be a short wait for lunch, but it all depends on when you go. I stopped by for a solo lunch one afternoon and sat at the bar, but saw people waiting for a table.My favorite thing here is their milk tofu. It has a nice, refreshing creamy texture with a drizzle of strawberry sauce. I'll come back just for it.Sobaya has nice soupy noodle choices. I have to rave about the $15 lunch box special. For $15, you get a choice of cold or hot soba and then a huge bento box filled with tempura, grilled fish, salad, and vegetables. It's perfect for an empty stomach and the entire meal is balanced enough so it doesn't feel overly unhealthy. For dessert, you get a little serving of the milk tofu. Service is very friendly and fast. I was in and out of lunch in a little over 30 minutes. When I was eating, I noticed they placed a tray of food next to me. A woman sat down next to me a few minutes after it was placed there. She probably has a special ready-to-eat arrangement with the servers there!
C K.}Seattle, WA}67}22}2}-1}5}4/29/2008}I went for dinner on a rainy Monday night so there was no problem getting a table. The whole meal made me and my friend giddy. It was all so perfectly fresh and delicious. The flavors were delicate and balanced. The chicken tenders with green tea salt are mind blowing. The soba is amazing. Also, the toilet seat in the women's room is heated! My new favorite spot...
Delphi L.}New York, NY}20}73}1325}-1}4}4/21/2008}Sobaya was our second choice last Saturday night after we were rejected by Ippudo Ramen (that place was crazily packed, and there's a more than one hour wait, we were told). We opted for Sobaya as the waiting time was said to be around half an hour, which of course ran much longer than promised (all restaurants do the same to keep customs in waiting). =)This was our second time in Sobaya, we tried a few new dishes. For starters, we ordered 1. Japanese Yam (sticky soup, white) with Urchin, 2. Yoba Sashimi (Yoba is the skin/surface of the soup when Tofu is made, supposedly the most nutritious part). The first one was very refreshing and tasty-- the yellow urchin was put together with grinded sticky white yam, a couple pieces of seaweed as decoration on the side. When you eat it, stir everything in the bowl with chopsticks and add a few drops of soy sauce and then use a spoon to drink it as a soup. It's quite challenging though as the sticky soup was so slippery and constantly spilled out of the spoon.As usual, we ordered Moriawase (Choice of three vegetables listed above, $11), as it costs at least 4.5 if you order separately.  The dishes are really really tiny in size, close to one mouthful, to give you an idea.S ordered Nishi-ni Soba (Slow-cooked herring fish) for 18.5. He liked it a lot, but I think the fish was a bit too sweet (well, that's the Japanese style fish cooking, boiling the fish in soysace, mirin, sake and sugar).We ended with three ice creams (green tea, sesame, citron with red bean topping), which sweetened the whole night.
Rose W.}New York, NY}178}343}278}-1}4}4/21/2008}I came here for dinner on a Friday night - and the place was packed, with an approximate half an hour wait.  Cold soba nicely complements a warm (almost hot) Spring night.  I had a light meal with the avocado tuna tartare to start, followed by the tororo soba.  The soba was fresh and cool - just the way I liked it!  I eyed and ulimately passed on the dessert menu, but going back would probably try the milk pudding with strawberry.I really liked the lighting and the lights - they were authentically pretty.
GO-GO-YU-BALI m.}New York, NY}29}240}23}-1}5}4/15/2008}their soba and udon are so fresh.the restaurant reminds me of some of japanese local soba restaurants; friendly, clean atmosphere.cold soba is great for summer!
Chris W.}Tenafly, NJ}14}29}3}-1}5}4/2/2008}Susy H.... Do they even have sushi here? I never noticed. Either the noodles are so good it made me blind to the sushi options or you had a bigger hangover than you thought and were actually at the execllent restaurant Hasaki down the street.The soba is exceptional here. The appetizers are first rate. My favorite is the kinpira made from burdock and lotus root. Yow! You can get it as part of a 3-part cold appetizer starter.Also the goma-tofu is excellent. Took a friend here and she spontaneously made some kind of orgasm noise when she tasted it.My favorite of the moment is the soba salad with crabmeat. It is a mix of buckwheat soba, mesclun greens, etc. that you dip into a wickedly pungent sesame dressing.
Elise K.}New York, NY}6}59}2}-1}4}4/2/2008}This place is quite tasty.  I loved the soba at Honmura An (now closed), so I was trying to find an alternative.  Their uni (sea urchin) soba is great.  The place is packed and there's always a wait of 30+ minutes (no reservations).  Yummy!
Melanie S.}New York, NY}203}7}0}-1}5}3/30/2008}My favorite, my steady, my must have. The homemade soba is to die for. The seared tuna on garlic rice is my crack. The big bowls of soup cure a cold winter day. A genuinely authentic Japanese dining experience. This has been my standby for years and will continue to be so. Long live Sobaya.
Dan D.}Lausanne, Switzerland}44}52}2}-1}4}3/27/2008}Excellent soba!!  Finally, the first truly delicious soba noodle I've had since leaving Japan!  We also had sashimi moriawase, which was only OK, but not unreasonable in price.
Esther K.}New York, NY}202}356}81}-1}4}3/26/2008}This is one of my favorite places when i'm in the mood for something hot and soupy! It was also the first time i've had hot soba (i'm used to cold soba), but i must say i am a new fan! i think i actually prefer the hot soba over the cold soba here because i feel like the soup has more flavor. however if you do order the cold soba, they give you a teapot of soup/water that you can add to your sauce for your drinking pleasure at the end of your meal. Lunch is the best time to come in because they offer different lunch combination boxes. my favorite one to boot is the seared tuna/ soba combo! The tuna comes on a bed of rice. The rice is dressed with a blend of soy sauce and other ingredient that is quite tasty and goes along well with the tuna. i've tried the salmon/salmon roe combo as well which is also good but i'd stick with the seared tuna any day!  i also heard that matsuyi (sp? the new york yankee) is also a customer here! also, i don't know if anyone collects restaurant matches, but they have the best matches here! i always pick up a box... or two... or maybe three... from the front desk... hehe!
Susy H.}Los Angeles, CA}307}224}114}-1}3}3/26/2008}Sushi after a hangover is not genius...Learned that here...But the sushi, the sushi she was good...
Viet D.}Park La Brea, CA}47}27}9}-1}4}3/20/2008}This was my very first restaurant in my first visit to NYC. My travel-the-world-seen-many-places-NY-for-life Uncle recommended this spot for that cold October night. It was memorable (I apologize for being nostalgic), but I just remember it being very cozy in there. The noodles were good and like someone else said, it  was like 'comfort' food. The food was good enough and the service better, but the main reason for the four stars is that I just loved the environment. Sobaya doesn't try to be anything more than it is - quiet, not trendy, not bourgie, and not cheapy (is that a word?) Very much a local favorite spot and a great place to go with your friends for a good dinner, some good drinks, and a good time.
Andrew Y.}San Francisco, CA}178}1353}0}-1}4}3/3/2008}We went to this restaurant for lunch and it was pretty good. I got the lunch box (which apparently was NEW!). It had a lot of things in it for $15. I got soba (hot or cold), a bunch of vegetables, some baked fish (salmon), salad, and tempura. All was good and hit the spot. The place looks mainly like an udon house which also did taste like udon normally does. Anyway, the decoration nice and the service was good. You are brought hand towels when you first sit down. Keep the outside germies away.
Domu A.}Singapore, Singapore}13}46}40}-1}4}2/10/2008}I think I've been putting off reviewing this restau because there are already so many reviews.But it's my comfort restau...kind of.  It's too pricey to be my comfort restaurant.  I have some friends who refuse to eat here because they don't think it's worth it.  I go here because I know what I like, and I almost always order the same thing(s).Their (cold) soba and udon are equally good.  If served cold, the udon is thin.  It's always al dente.  I almost always have cold tororo soba/udon (grated mountain yam with nori).  They used to do a tororo-nameko-quail egg combo.  I might have convinced myself that there was natto in there but I don't think there was.  Now you can add nameko or daikon but not egg.  Not sure the add-ons are worth the dosh, to be honest.  Was feeling particularly gluttonous the other day and ordered a side of tempura batter cos it was 50 cents.  Erp.  Oil jellied my insides.I'm not a fan of their hot soba.  Their hot udon is fat--I much prefer it thiin and cold.  If I'm shivering, I'll still order cold and count on following up with soba-yu.  Their broth is too salty and the noodles arrive soft.  That said, I've tried their nishin soba (cooked herring) and it's decent.  But if I'm going to spend $18 on one dish, I'll go with the tunasteak don, which comes with beautiful, delicate clear soup. They have my favorite ice cream flavors.  I like a trio of yuzu, honey wasabi, and green tea--but if I'm with a friend who wants black sesame instead of green tea, I'm equally happy.  Single scoop, yuzu--no question.  But if I'm with a friend, 3 scoops is more economical and is definitely the way to go.Have also tried the pudding but I've forgotten what it was.  I remember that it was tiny, though.
Ben K.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}5}1/22/2008}The broth and soba is unlike other restaurants that serve the same items.  It's not the typical iruko/katsuo flavor, but something more complex. I am not sure what else is used when they boil broth but it's definitely good.The soba is consistent and always tastes wheat like, slightly chewy (al dente). Udon is good, too, but I prefer soba when dining here... It's their thing!If you happen to go for lunch, order the bento set. It comes with a well balanced portion of grilled or broiled fish (salmon), nimono (sweet rice wine simmered lotus root, carrots, boiled spinach, boiled Japanese potatos, boiled and simmered burdock and shiitake), a small cup of boiled and sauteed hijiki seaweed with carrot, mesclun salad with house dressing (citrus based) and some tempura. The meal is completed with Sobaya's house dessert, which is uaually milk tofu.
Susan T.}New York, NY}150}72}0}-1}3}1/21/2008}I'm not a soba or ramen connoisseurs, but I was told that these are very good (though quite honestly, I was very meh about it). I really like the wait staff, and the sake was good. I was confused by the toilet, which resembled those I saw in Tokyo with all these fancy buttons on the side.  I'm not itching to go back.
N. M.}New York, NY}27}194}9}-1}5}1/20/2008}I had the yasai soba noodles, which were amazing. The place was busy, but they took our cell number down so we could grab a drink across the street. Service was good - I had a guest who had eaten well in Japan and he was impressed with the place. Definitely a go-to in the area.
Greg T.}San Francisco, CA}100}132}36}-1}3}1/19/2008}More like 2.5 stars.Food was honestly unimpressive. Friend had the "Tuna Steak" aka albacore on sushi rice.  My quips:  The tuna was old and low quality, I'd estimate 2 or 3 days past its prime--it was probably intended for sashimi, but ended up being used in a cooked dish in order to hide it's borderline spoiled taste.  it was also "seared" at too low of a temperature leaving the tuna without any sign of browning or blackening.  I had the nabeyaki.  The broth was empty tasting and unbalanced, a bit acrid.  Not a good sign if the broth sucks.  Noodles were soggy and over cooked and lacked decent texture.  For dessert, we split the chestnut brulee and the satsuma yam flan.  Both were suprisingly good.  The green tea was cheap (by taste) but somehow surprisingly clean and acceptable.  The bill came to about $50 for two, which, considering the quality of the food, was absolutely not worth it.  Well, I tried it once, I don't think I'll be going back.  Service was attentive and very polite.  On a Friday night, we had to wait about 20 minutes.
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}3}1/17/2008}I came here on Christmas day with a friend, but the wait wasn't too long. The waitor was very attentive (and spoke perfect English) and taught all the customers how to eat everything. You'll see what I mean when or if you go there. The only thing I have to say that stood out was the dessert, and not in a good way. We shared the trio of ice cream: Black Sesame, Honey Wasabi, and the Japanese Citrus one. They were made from fresh ingredients and needless to say, homemade. They smelled great but tasted TOO fresh. The orange skin made the citrus ice cream too bitter, and too much, too chewy! Too much grittyness in the ice cream made it... not ice cream-like. Same with the Black Sesame. The Honey Wasabi tasted exactly the way it sounded, which made it too spicy for an ice cream (But hey, if you're into that...). At the end, we had to give up and push away those cute little wads of disappointments away from our faces and get the check. The sake lasted us all night long. Again, typical soba that you can get somewhere else for a better price. But mad props to the waitor who served us!P.S. try the bathroom! I didn't try the special butt-washing function, but uh, you can!
Junkfoodie Q.}NY, NY}12}372}0}-1}4}1/12/2008}Tried the duck soba with scallions.  It came nice and hot, with plenty of thinly-sliced pieces of duck still being cooked on top of the noodles.  The side of scallions came chopped up and I was able to pour as much of scallions as I wanted into the broth (of course, I added all of it). The noodles were definitely tasty and cooked perfectly, not overcooked and not chewy.   But I was suprised I didn't get any kind of sauce on the side to add to my duck noodles (plum sauce?  hoisin sauce?).  I tend to always order sushi/sashimi (99% of the time) whenever I eat at a Japanese restaurant, so it was nice trying out something new in Japanese cuisine.
Anuja G.}New York, NY}47}123}7}-1}5}1/10/2008}My friend Jenna T. and I came here before taking our drug tests for work, and we have made a pact to go back.We went for lunch and both got the lunch special. WARNING: if you get the lunch special, be ready to eat a lot of food and not be able to eat anything for the rest of the day!You get a bento box full of deliciousness, your choice of soba/udon (hot/cold) and a dessert all for $16. Everything was great, and I think Jenna and I are going to take a half day off work just so we can come here for the lunch special again. You get much more than your money's worth!
Coconuts B.}New York, NY}99}20}0}-1}5}1/10/2008}If I ever left New York, the one thing I would miss the most would probably be Sobaya.  The soba noodles are perfect.  The broth exquisite... and addictive.  The waiters polite and attentive.  One of the best deals for lunch!  Attention to detail is what distinguishes a good restaurant from a great one, and Sobaya definitely takes care of the details --- from making sure your tea is always hot by giving you a new cup instead of refilling your cool one, to the finely chopped scallions and perfectly shredded nori, to the pretty pottery and plating, to the excellent homemade side dishes and desserts.  This is one of the best Japanese restaurants / soba houses out there!My fave items:    yuba sashimi, cold soba with tempura, the lunch box, kinoko oroshi (cold soba with kinoko mushrooms and grated radish).  Make sure to pour the soba-yu (the water used to cook the noodles) into the tsuyu (soy dipping sauce) after you finish your noodles.  That's the best part!My fave desserts: sesame ice cream, milk tofu, chestnut custard, sesame creme brulee.  Anmitsu in the summer time.Try the:  cold soba tea.
Michelle Q.}New York, NY}53}88}0}-1}3}12/29/2007}I was being told that my friend's cousin ran into kate hudson and her ex husband at Sobaya last year, so I insisted on going there to check it out. It must be at least decent to have celebrities visit. I was a little disappointed. The restaurant layout is very clean and cozy, but the food is lack of varieties, portion, and very pricey. I'm sure I could find some other soba places for cheaper price with comparable food value.
Gracie-C Y.}San Francisco, CA}76}308}2}-1}3}12/15/2007}Full disclosure: Wifey and I much prefer ramen.We could feel the crisp winter air when we landed at JFK.  Five friggin' hours of flying and all we ate were a few stale gumdrops fished out of  the back pockets of my faded jeans.  We were murderously ravenous by the time we stepped off the train into the East Village.  I knocked over an old lady carrying a bag of groceries as well as a couple of NYU students during my delirious search for food.  Wifey bit the old lady in the leg and stole a bialy from her grocery bag... serves her right for getting in our way.We stumble into Soba-ya looking for a hot bowl of noodles.  They sit us down lickety-split and serve us with quick but courteous Japanese efficiency.  I slurp down a bowl of hot soba and duck (served rare, nice) while wifey nearly bites off a piece of the ceramic dinnerware eating her soba and light, crispy tempura.Good noodles, but did I mention we much prefer ramen?For dessert, we walked a couple of blocks over to Ramen Setagaya for a large bowl of Tsukemen.
Eric C.}New York, NY}47}140}0}-1}4}11/27/2007}Pricey.  Udon was very good, though. You can tell they use very good ingredients here - the noodles had a bite to them that most places cannot imitate.
Jon L.}New York, NY}169}449}0}-1}4}11/18/2007}i was here on saturday around 12:30ish and it was packed.  wait wasn't too bad, around 15 minutes.  i ordered the lunch box special for 15 bucks and it was delicious.  lots of variety (salad, tempura, piece of salmon, seaweed sorta thingey, some kind of yummy tuber-like thingey and more things that were also good), and the cold soba was really good.  texture was just right.  i also had fun dipping it into the soy sauce, but that's not really a plus for the restaurant, more one of my own weird tendencies.  and then they also give you dessert.  i have no idea what the other food tastes like, but my friend got another dish and she thought it was great.  oh, there were also a billion adorable asian toddlers running around which made me happy.
Sam P.}New York, NY}1882}875}636}-1}3}11/16/2007}Remember that time I said I don't get down to the East Village that often?  I lied.  I seem to have found myself down here a lot this week. And on my way to a party on 7th street, I was having a very strong craving for something brothy, noodly and seafoody.  A quick Yelp Mobile seach for Noodles in the East Village yielded Sobaya.  So I dragged my companion for some "japanese delights."Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'm with David S.  I just wasn't that blown away. It seems pretty much like every other little East Village Japanese place.  After some seat shuffling (for which they apologized by bringing us some yummy vegetables), we settled in.  Maybe I ordered wrong (we both got the Udon Casserole thing) and it was fine, but a little overwhelming with all the ingredients.  I am no one's Japanese food connoisseur, but it just didn't seem all that spectacular.  And for some reason I was expecting speedy service, and that it certainly wasn't.  I could give it another shot, but I don't see any reason to.  There are a dozen similar places in a two block radius.
Larry Y.}New Providence, NJ}43}223}14}-1}4}11/1/2007}There's a guy up at front, making the namesake noodles.  Go here for the lunch (bento?) boxes, soba and udon noodles.  The interior has good ambiance, and a nice place to eat lunch.Also, try the soba beer.
Peter K.}Hoboken, NJ}82}508}21}-1}4}10/29/2007}I went here with my wife, friend and friend's sister yesterday for lunch. The friend was visiting from Boston and is currently on a big Japanese culture kick so she really wanted to find a good soba place (apparently, the selection of Japanese restaurants in Boston is pretty poor).Anyway, I thought about going to this place before for lunch but didn't because it looked pricey at first. But if you take a careful look at their lunch boxes and sets, they give you a ton of food! So if you're hungry and want to try a lot of different types of appetizers (plus basically two main courses), it's well worth the price!I had the cold soba with pork katsu-don lunch set. I prefer the cold soba to the hot soba because the noodles are so thin that if you stick it in hot broth, it gets a little soggy. If you really want something hot, go with the udon noodles instead. The cold soba noodles were cooked just right.
Jack L.}New York, NY}108}112}0}-1}4}10/29/2007}Good soba. The yam/uni appetizer was kinda wierd but it grows on you. The cold soba with the mini shrimp tempura and  hot duck broth soba was both very good. I'd recommend the hot soba for winter and the cold for summer.
Poof S.}San Diego, CA}5}36}0}-1}5}10/18/2007}Always go there whenever I'm in NYC. Their udon is so yummy and has that chewy, al-dente bite that I love. Unfortunately, I've never tried their soba yet, but my friend swears by it.. especially their chirashi.On my recent trip, I tried their seared tuna. It's soo good. The tuna melts in your mouth, and the sauce was amazing! I went there one more time before I left NYC to satisfy my craving. Gosh, I'm craving for it now, and I'm in the other side of the coast now. Sigh..Can't wait to go back there again. The service and ambiance are excellent.
Julie K.}New York, NY}226}418}883}-1}5}10/15/2007}I was going to give 4 stars before lunch menu..  I do love Ramen.. I do love noodle, but Sobaya's Soba and Udon didn't give me any impression..wait! did I just say I didn't like my foods here?oh, nooooo!  then, let me tell you about their LUNCH BOX option!First, it's HUGE!  yup!  the portion is HUGE! 1 Bento box + Soba or Udon (cold / hot) + 1 Desert  = Bae Bul Leur (full)Second, it's HUGE!  yup!  their service is friendly HUGE with smile!Third, it's HUGE!  yup!  the price is HUGE!  $15 for lunch?  that's steep..BUT, you will get HUGE belly + HUGE satisfaction! oh oh!  like other Japaneses restaurants, there's another HUGE gift for ladies..  yup!  BIDET!
Hannah L.}Hoboken, NJ}34}115}0}-1}4}10/9/2007}Decent service.  Decent noodles. Decent price.  Wish they had takoyaki and gyoza, but even without this place is a go-to spot for hot noodles.
Sean T.}New York, NY}21}86}64}-1}5}10/2/2007}Recommended for:  Soba, udon and delicious japanese delights.Food 6, Service 4, Ambiance 5.If NY suddenly was only allowed to have a handful of restaurants, I'd say Sobaya would have to be one of those - its just that lip smacking GOOD!  I can eat Soba and Udon any time of the year and on that hot day, all I wanted was a heaping hot bowl of noodles.I usually order first japanese sweet potato which was cooked perfectly.  4 slices of potato each with small amount of sauce making it sweet, but not too sweet - but believe me, it was OOOH so good!  For the main course, I often get the Nabeyaki udon.  BEWARE: this is a huge clay pot filled with noodles, tempura carrot/broccoli/shrimp, egg, fish cake, chicken, mushrooms, scallions and more.  The portion is huge so come hungry.  The broth was light and flavorful and the ingredients cooked perfectly.Service is good, not fantastic and the decor is nice, charming and quiet.  While it does get busy, it doesn't get overly noisy.  The restaurant has a calming theme that helps one relax while scarfing down everything in site...I will say, like other authentic japanese places in the city, the women have a japanese toilet (electronic bidet) while we men, are stuck with a mere mortal bowl... equality... all I ask for is equality!!!Sean Approved:  Zettaini ita houga ii yo!!!
Caroline A.}Fairfax, VA}1132}1178}22}-1}5}9/10/2007}So delicious.  I love soba.  I love udon.  So when we went to Sobaya, I was a happy girl.  Even in the hot and humid weather, I got a huge bowl of nabayaki udon and almost finished the whole bowl. The noodles were cooked perfectly to just the right chewiness and the stone bowl kept the broth hot. If I knew how large the portion was, I would have split the bowl with SJT, but I was really hungry and my eyes were bigger than my stomach (happens often).  I loved the noodles, tempura carrot, egg, fish cake, and shitake mushroom.  I wasn't crazy about the two pieces of chicken, but I'm not a big chicken eater.We also had this delicious japanese sweet potato appetizer that I'm craving right now, which is what made me think of writing this review.  I will return many times to Sobaya and go to Cha-An across the street for dessert!
Alden H.}San Francisco, CA}37}133}3}-1}4}9/10/2007}Im such a big fan of this place. We love finding authentic little Japanese places like this in the city. The kamo is my absolute favorite. I need to go with a bigger group so I can try more of their non-soba items. Ive never left disappointed :)
Antoaneta J.}Toronto, Canada}7}31}0}-1}5}8/22/2007}Now that fall seems to be upon us I keep craving a big bowl of hot soba with slices of roasted duck on top. Yum! So since Honmura-An's demise this is where I get my fix (I actually liked both almost equally until Honmura-An won by a small margin of tiny cartoon mushrooms...)The second reason I keep going back to Sobaya is the Honey Wasabi ice cream - sweetness with just a touch of fire - it may sound strange but it's very comforting.And last but not least, they have a Toto washlet in the bathroom. And that's the pinnacle of tush-friendly civilization.
Tony L.}San Francisco, CA}710}1265}21}-1}4}8/16/2007}Soba-ya is a fantastic Japanese dining experience.  I came here with a coworker for a soba inspired bento box lunch special.  Usually when I think of bento boxes, I think of salad, some kind of teriyaki, and maybe a small sushi roll or tempura.  This is much different.As its namesake suggests, the main draw is the soba.  Made on the premesis, a healthy portion of soba is served either hot or cold.  The noodles have a dense texture and a delicate taste.  It's served with a soy based dipping sauce that you can flavor with wasabi to taste.  Later, it is mixed with broth as an after meal soup.  Unique ande delicious.Inside the box itself are the usual suspects, tempura and salad, as well with several other side dishes including a tiny cucumber salad, a small slamon fileet, a tiny jar of seaweed, seseme seeds, and minced carrots; and a mix of marinated mushrooms, lotus, and carots.  A very surprising, light, and flavorful combo.The lunch special also came with desert, a rich, sweet tofu topped with a marinated slide of strawberry with a mint leaf garnish.  It's a little small, as to be expected from a lunchtime desert, but very tasty, similar to the taste and consistency of panna cotta.For 15 bucks, I would definitely recommend this place for anybody interested in a light and unique luncheon experience.
Lynn W.}New York, NY}110}168}69}-1}4}8/9/2007}I have been to Sobaya numerous times since I moved to NY. Great food, spacious restaurant, the only down side to it is the wait. But you can always leave your phone number with the hostess and then wander around the neighborhood. A bit on the pricy side.
Javier M.}New York, NY}707}388}173}-1}5}8/6/2007}An spotless image is the way to this yelper's heart; I could waive many other inconsistencies (including my waiter's apparent hearing problem) if you give me a place that will zoom-in my cornea and yield a Zen Garden.Soba-YA: I loove Soba, so yeah, this must be a biased review:**Bias switch on**I came here on Sunday for dinner with friends; and I got to sample pretty much a little bit of everything; but the one thing that stood out was the delicious Tuna Tartar rolls on Avocado which I just posted; amazing. Simply delicious; avocado was salty, and peppered with flakes of parsley which yielded superb flavor. Ahi tuna is a no brainer since I loove ahi tuna. Also, the soba I tried was very soft when I prefer it a little bit more harder.Finally, despite what the yelpers have said, it was not pricey at all; the table was replete with appetizers and platters AND Sake, and it came to about 60 bucks; and this considering that this is from the very same owners of takai-des ne Sakagura.**Bias switch off**
Jason O.}Albany, CA}32}75}0}-1}3}8/4/2007}A Japanese friend of ours recommended this spot as one of her favorites - we figured it doesn't get more authentic than that, right?We came here for dinner, the wait was 30 mins, but the hostess took our cell phone # and told us she'd call - a nice touch, since that allowed us to roam the neighborhood and kill time at the St. Marks' Bookstore.Once we were seated, we ordered the seaweed salad (green and chewy and delicious) and oshinko (japanese seasonal pickles - a bit of a letdown, not very pickled, kind of bland).  I had the sea urchin soba and my girlfriend had the tuna soba.  Both dishes were delicious but disappeared within minutes...For dessert we picked a trio of homemade ice creams: black sesame, Japanese yuzu, and wasabi-honey.  All three were delicious and completely unique and frankly sort of mind-blowing (i love ice cream).We enjoyed our meal but the price was a bit steep, and the soba wasn't very filling. It was only then that our Japanese friend clarified that what she meant was to recommend Sobaya for lunch, not dinner (which, as stated, is a bit pricey for the amount of food).So I guess we'll have to go back and try again..
Emily K.}New York, NY}14}234}0}-1}4}7/31/2007}A bit pricey, but it's worth coming here for the lunch specials.  The bento lunch special comes with your choice of hot or cold soba along with a huge lunch box containing tempura, inari sushi, salad, nimono, etc.  AND you get a dessert of a small cup of green tea mousse with a dollop of cream!  Filling and worth the $13 or so you're paying for it.  I was really looking forward to the soba, since people seem to rave about it, but I thought it was fairly average.They also have soba specials that change daily, so check that out as well.
Gaby M.}Nantes, France}57}130}266}-1}5}7/4/2007}Everything here tastes good...what else can I say.. i love thsi place!Yumm-yum!
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}26}290}0}-1}4}7/2/2007}Love this place - they have a great lunch set that includes a bento box with all kinds of goodies (futomaki, tempura veggies, fish, seaweed salad) plus your choice of hot or cold soba. They make their own soba, which is delicious. I've also had the donburi with soba, which was far too much food, but it was very good.Also been there for dinner, where we tried the soba beer - very interesting, and pretty good! They also have a good sake list. The dinner menu offers many more traditional items, such as freshly made tofu, yuba, a variety of broiled fish, roasted ginkgo nuts, and many other things you won't find on every Japanese menu in town. I've enjoyed my many  meals at Sobaya, and look forward to many more!
Eric Y.}Brookline, MA}10}14}0}-1}5}6/16/2007}This place has the best soba I have ever had in the U.S., so I have the to give it a 5 star.  I am sure there are many more places that are better in Japan, but I think this might be the best here.  I took my roommate, a white boy who had never had soba before, to this place.  After he finished his soba, he said, "Damn, I can have another one of this!"  My reply was...."Me too!"  But I didn't know why he gave it a 4 star..haha.So if you ever go, get the soba, specifically the cold soba.  This is how you can really tell how good the texture of the noodle is and the "tenderness" of the noodle.  I have never tried their udon (cold or hot) or their hot soba, so I cannot give any comments on them.  But their noodle is very very good (get any cold soba).  They also have good appetizers.  Interestingly, they carry a soba beer.  I tried it, not bad, but nothing special.  Whenever I go to New York, I will try to go there when I have the time!
Matt W.}Cambridge, MA}234}101}17}-1}4}6/1/2007}I can sum this place up by saying the quality is excellent but the price is steep. I left in awe, but yet a tad hungry and wanting more. The wanting more part could be due to the quality, but the portions are in fact a bit small. If you want good soba you should give this place a try because I don't think it gets much better....just realize you will pay for it.
Jessica Y.}Austin, TX}319}156}59}-1}4}5/14/2007}To truly experience soba noodles, slurping is the way to go.  And loud too.  The louder you slurp, the more appreciation you're showing the chef.  It's an art, really, and it's not hard to master when you're at Soba-ya.As you can tell by my previous reviews, I have a huge crush on  the owner of Decibel and Sakagura.. and Soba-ya also belongs to this talented restaurateur.  The great thing about Japanese food is that not only does it taste great, it's healthy.  Like soba, high in fiber, so there's no post-meal guilt to deal with.  Try their appetizers, spinach and tofu... again, healthy!  While you're enjoying your soba, why not order some nice cold sake to cool off.. ask for it in wooden box, which naturally gives a hint of sweetness when you drink off of it.    You can trust that it'll be good sake after experiencing Sakagura and Decibel.Not full yet?  get the black sesame ice cream.  It's yum~! I have yet to find a good place here in Cali that serves it, so let me live vicariously through you and please order some.Overall a nice cozy soba place.  Enjoy and slurp up!
Yasmine S.}New York, NY}17}61}0}-1}5}5/8/2007}Between 2nd Avenue and 3rd AvenueHours:    * Sun-Thu 12pm-10:30pm    * Fri, Sat 12pm-11pmBest soba in NYC!  If you go during lunch sometimes, you can see them making the noodles right there --- mmm, fresh.  They also have a wonderful consistency.  I'm a big fan of their fried chicken too.  And the waiters (many of them anyway) speak Japanese.
Rob T.}Canton, MA}10}66}1}-1}3}5/7/2007}Generally a good experience.  The noodles were fresh which was great.  A little pricey for lunch though.
Michelle C.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}75}29}1}-1}3}4/16/2007}ahh sobaya...tried this because i heard so many rave reviews from friends and since i needed my udon fix, i decided to venture out to this place and see what the fuzz was about. i wasn't really that disappointed, but i wasn't that impressed either. i thought the udon was kind of bland. i was reading other reviews for this place and some thought it was salty....so maybe it's safe to say that this place is inconsistent. i guess i'll just have to give this place another try.
KC L.}New York, NY}51}96}3}-1}4}4/11/2007}Sobaya is great!  Both soba and small dishes.  I like this place more than Honmura An (the Soho Soba spot), but I've only been to Honmura An once (probably need to try it again).
David S.}San Diego, CA}304}652}282}-1}3}4/11/2007}I have mixed feelings about Sobaya: my office mate took me there for lunch a while ago after I told him I had yet to find a good and cheap Japanese noodle joint in the Village (I have found a couple since). The place is pretty cozy, and it certainly looks nicer than your average noodle restaurant. The food was also pretty good: I had one the udon soups, which was tasty if not too exciting. Yet, I can't help thinking it was a bit overpriced: I think I paid close to $15 for lunch... for a bowl of udon... a little stiff.
BrasilPo P.}Oakland, CA}100}515}833}-1}3}4/6/2007}Imported SOBATouted as a MUST EAT, I tried their imported-straight-from-Japan-buckwheat-flour hand-made SOBA. It was s'allright. The best part? The restroom. Seriously. The price nowhere matches the quality of the quantity you get.  A little over-rated.
Hinako S.}Hamburg, Germany}4}30}81}-1}4}4/3/2007}I went here because SOBAKOH was closed on monday! and i didnt know that.I ordered hot tororo soba, and my bf ordered curry soba, and for appetizer, he ordered a small donburi of salmon and ikura.I like how they have small portion size donburi. it was my second time coming to this soba ya place but last time i had salad soba.I really like tororo soba. I think i liked it better because the soba flavor and the actuall soba matched the yam really good. For desert, I had macha kuzu. and my friends and bf had ice cream with redbeans and black sesame ice cream.i tried on theirs and i really liked black sesame one.I like black sesame a lot. macha kuzu had red beans and ice cream in it.the portion was really small though. ice cream was pretty big. but cheaper than macha kuzu. ice cream had soba chips in it too!from 5:30-6:30, there is early bird special where u get, appetizer, soba or udon with tempura, inari, and a desert. desert is just a fruit though.but this is around 13 dallers. not that bad !i think lunch is better because its much cheaper. dinner comes out to be pretty pricey.
Kristina W.}New York, NY}13}201}17}-1}4}2/28/2007}The service and ambiance were both very enjoyable.  I had the hot soba with tofu which was excellent.  I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.  Be prepared for a wait though.  No reservations and on the weekend, you're pretty much guaranteed a 45+ min wait.  The good thing is that they will take your # so you can walk around and they will call you when your table is ready.
Brian L.}Belmont, CA}22}88}1}-1}5}12/15/2006}HOLY COW, this place is SO GOOD!  Learn from my experience...if you goto NY and love home made udon among other tasty dishes, Soba-ya MUST be your first stop for lunch.  MUST!  Why?  Because if you love it as much as I do, you can go back at least one more time before you leave NY.  I was only able to go once and now all I have is a photograph to remind me of the best Japanese lunch set EVER.  That's right...a photograph...All you need to start you on your way is the Tuna Steak-don lunch set w/ hot udon and extra Tuna Steak-don sauce.  TRUST ME.  :DBTW, I posted the pic so you know what I'm talking about.
Jen D.}Berlin, Germany}268}1481}274}-1}5}11/26/2006}The best soba place in NYC, hands down. Even my friends who are here from Japan would agree. The soba is superb. Should I say more? No. Go! Now! Go! :)
Henry C.}Flushing, NY}22}13}11}-1}4}11/26/2006}I typically do not  like Japanese food as it is quite drab and uncreative.  Sushi is all the same in structure: kelp, rice, stuffing.  Sashima is just mushy, raw meat embellished with a whole community of parasites eager to cross over to your body (take it from someone who mastered their parasitology course).  Their cooked stuff like the fried beef (forgot what it was called) is just that, deep fried and requiring sauce to have taste.  However one day when visiting my cousin in Cooper Union for the first time, he suggested eating at this restaurant.  With resignation I agreed to go here.  The atmosphere was decent and the noodle dish I had (I typically avoid ordering noodle dishes unless it's Penang or Malaysian) was quite hearty.  I wouldn't say it was the most pleasant dish I ever had but to not say that I didn't like it speaks for itself.  But what really  delighted my palate was not the entree or appetizers but the dessert.  I'm a ice cream lover and the ice cream I had there was very good.  I have made Chinatown Icecream factory my standard in excellence.  They have the greatest selection (as in having the best flavors) and the best taste in that you won't find many of their flavors elsewhere and their ice cream is not over sweetened like Cold Stone among some others.  The ice cream at this restaurant was  just as good and unique in it's own  way.  I would recommend this restaurant to those who have deeper pockets and like Japanese food.
Lindley E.}Chicago, IL}276}850}43}-1}4}11/20/2006}Fresh pulled noodles, savory broth with that just right amount of salt and only the slightest hint of smoky dashi...this is beautiful, lyrical soba...
Laura Y.}Denver, CO}65}161}56}18}4}11/12/2006}This place makes absolutely DELICIOUS soba. The most tasty, fresh, japanese noodles I've ever had. Totally recommended to anyone who likes good, clean food. Staff is attentive and goes out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your food. I was with two other people when I got to the restaurant, we were the first ones seated. Within 15 minutes the ENTIRE restaurant was filled. Many Japanese people eating here, so you know it's authetic.
Celicia C.}New York, NY}21}55}0}-1}5}9/26/2006}i truly love soba-ya. it's a treasure of mine tucked away in st. mark's place. i go there when i'm in the mood for high quality japanese comfort food...when everyone else gets the homemade soba there, i get the seared tuna with garlic sauce over rice. not only is the tuna plentiful and melt-in-your-mouth tasty but the garlic sauce is to die for...i always ask for an extra little pitcher of it. and the rice bowl itself is huge. it comes with an amazing bonito broth/mushroom soup. i also love the soba seaweed salad with crab...it's AMAZING. the salad dressing is delish also - they give it to you on the side so as to allow to add it to your taste. and don't skip the dessert menu - the black sesame, wasabi, and yuzu (japanese citrus) ice creams are delicious!!!
jenn h.}Washington, DC}456}329}44}-1}4}9/19/2006}I've always loved soba, so I was excited to try Soba-ya.  Interestingly enough, while the soba was all that I hoped it would be (and more!), I was surprisingly impressed by a couple of other delicacies on the menu.  First of all, I really loved the Nabeyaki, which is only available as udon.  I normally prefer soba, but this udon was perfection in a pot. Next, under the appropriately named 'Delicacies' section, we decided to try the Buta Kakuni: simmered lump pork 'Berkshire' belly with soft-boiled egg.   OH!  MAH!  GOODNESS!   I'm not sure, but I think my dinner companions had to shut my mouth for me after wiping my drool.  If you like pork - or even if you don't - please don't visit without ordering this!  I know their noodles are considered their specialty, but this lesser-reviewed treat is not to be missed!  I know I'm excited because I'm using WAY too many exclamation points!!!
Kim D.}Cambridge, MA}106}232}15}-1}3}9/10/2006}As this one of my friend's favorite restaurants, I was excited about going to Sobaya and trying soba prepared the way it should be.  Although the presentation of the food is beautiful, I found the soba to be far too salty to be enjoyable.  The appetizers, salads, and sushi were great though.  The draw for this place is definitely the simple, comfortable, pretty space and the delicious ice cream for dessert -- the black sesame is fantastic, as are the wasabi and the vanilla served with red beans (I love red beans!).  Even though I didn't love the soba I ordered, the restaurant has an extensive menu and I'm sure I could find something better.
angela n.}Washington, DC}415}828}501}-1}5}8/26/2006}Damn great soba noodles; I like them cold and dipped in the broth.  So refreshing and salty-good.  The texture is perfect - not too sticky or soft, just right.
Mona N.}New York, NY}391}210}213}-1}1}8/18/2006}The broth is salty and the menn (noodles) is mushy. Al dente is not just for pasta, it applies to soba too. I've been here four times and not once finished an entire bowl. However I did walk across the street to fill up on takoyaki as soon as I paid my check. All four times. If you're looking for good soba, there's a great place in SoHo that begins with the letter H.  the end
Dee W.}Evanston, IL}186}1570}1299}-1}3}8/9/2006}I had the duck with their cold udon and it was definately delish.  The udon was very fresh tasting.  A bit on the pricey side for the potions that we received.  We somehow squished six people in a booth and the soba salad looked really good.
Wendy L.}Berkeley, CA}670}1227}64}18}5}8/8/2006}So good...!  My favorite thing to order at Sobaya is the tuna steak bowl and plain udon - both are so delicious.  Definitely order extra garlic sauce because for some reason it takes forever...and you'll definitely want more of it!  This place is a steal!
nancy l.}Beverly Hills, CA}6}60}10}-1}5}8/6/2006}I love Sobaya for their eel & soba noodle combo, and their tea!  Every time I come to New York I make a trip here for their good deal & good service.  Their noodle soup is a little salty, but I like it that way.  A friend of mine is a big fan of their tuna tataki (?) with garlic sauce.  Also, it's pretty inexpensive for what you get.Also, they have sesame ice cream!  It's so tasty.
Rahat A.}Downtown Brooklyn, NY}146}32}61}-1}5}8/1/2006}Hands down my favorite soba joint in the city.  The service is wonderful, the atmosphere is relaxed but not annoyingly loud and the food itself is fairly memorable.  I always crave the Nishin Soba (herring fish) there, and sometimes top it off with a "side" order of Unagi Don (eel over rice).  Throw in a couple of beers, and it's easy to have a great meal with a good friend.
Kenny L.}Astoria, NY}7}91}0}-1}4}7/27/2006}Go to Sobaya if you're looking for delicious noodles at a great price.For about $10 you get a big bowl of fresh soba or udon in broth with various niceties of your choosing. The nabeyaki was quite good, but the kamo (duck) was great. My only gripe is that the broth is overly... something. I couldn't quite place it. Possibly too much salt, possibly too much soy sauce but it distracted from the noodles and other contents of the bowl a little too much.Our steamed shumai was a little different than what I am used to but certainly enjoyable. I can't really recommend any of the three ice cream flavors that I tried - honey wasabi, black sesame, green tea. I wouldn't say that any of them were bad, but I didn't really enjoy them. Perhaps it's an acquired taste.
Ken and Yuri Q.}San Francisco, CA}21}106}3}-1}4}7/23/2006}Yeah, I like this place too.  The soba noodles have a great consistency, and they really help the June NYC heat.  This is on my list for every NYC visit...no matter what time of year.
Peter P.}Huntington Beach, CA}69}225}2}-1}5}6/24/2006}See my review for Sanuki no Sato.  Same thing, East Coast.
Kenneth K.}San Francisco, CA}5}44}0}-1}3}6/7/2006}After reading the solid Zagat review, I decided to check it out. Had the tempura soba which I thought was a tad too salty. Noodles definitely tasted fresh though. For apparently authentic soba, this is the place to go, but not sure it should be your choice if you are in the mood for anything else Japanese.
camilla c.}New York, NY}171}336}1}-1}4}5/2/2006}So many meals at Sobaya and I've never been disappointed.  This is a great Japanese noodle place for anyone that loves udon or soba.  I love both so Sobaya is a staple for me.  The curry udon, nabeyaki udon, tempura udon/soba, and the kitsune soba are all great... you can't go wrong here.  Great way to start the meal (or just as a side dish) is their adegashi tofu (perfect light layer of tempura) and sweet yam (morsels of goodness).  For your entree, definitely would recommend udon or soba since this is what they're known for, but their rice dishes are awesome too... esp the tuna, which is always fresh and cooked perfectly, or the salmon with roe.  I love how these rice dishes come in a mini size as well.  If I'm starving, I'll go crazy with a combo noodles & rice dish (obviously, i'm not afraid of carbs).  Finish your meal with ice cream... the yuzu flavor is a good one.
Faffy L.}San Francisco, CA}188}302}65}-1}3}3/29/2006}I tried amaebi there for the first time and it was very fresh and tasty. Although the juiciness might appear to be slimy if you're not used to it. Had this little yuba dish for appetizer. I think I am not raving about this place because when I got my entree, my thoughts tanked. I ordered a cold soba with tuna (+another ingredient). Noodles were good, but man it had a weird coating/sauce like it was mixed with some natto or something. I slurped this up in like 3 minutes if that and for the rest of the evening, I just sat and watched my friends eat their food, which was just OK in my book. The soba I got was $15!!!!! =O I went there because I heard that they have wasabi ice cream, and I was DYING to try it. I had wasabi gelato once in SF and it was awesome. Unfortunately their wasabi ice cream was not so subtle, it tasted like it was spiked with fresh ginger. I was pretty bummed after that. I don't know about coming back here, but if you do, expect small delicate portions.
Larry L.}New York, NY}69}61}75}-1}4}2/28/2006}You could eat here for... probably about $10 if all you ate was soba. And it is good soba. But man, would you be missing out. Dive deeper into the menu. Maybe bamboo shoots are in season? Dobin-mushi served out of a teapot? Or what about broiled sweetfish with fried baby crab (see pic)? Salted, preserved squid guts? Have a seat at the bar and begin asking what's in all the jars, and start ordering them. Try the trio of ice creams for dessert. Yuzu was... bracing. Black sesame I could eat all day.
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}2}78}1}-1}5}2/14/2006}even when berries are out of season, the ones they serve always taste fresh and sweet.  how do they do it???  The food is soo tasty and fresh tasting.  the miso broth can be a bit strong but i do have sensitive tastebuds, or so I've been told.  You can watch people make the noodles you are about the consume!!  how cool is that?!plus, once, we waited about 15 or 20 minutes for our food and for some reason, the restaurant apologized for our long wait and brought us a complimentary basket of edamame and later gave us ice cream for dessert.  20 minutes could be considered a normal wait time at most good restaurants, i think.  they service is just really friendly and good and the food is fresh and tasty.  makes my tummy happy if not my wallet.  expensive, but worth it on occasion.  :)
Mike C.}New York, NY}211}25}1}-1}5}1/26/2006}Great fresh noodles, good selection of sake, get there at the right time and you mayeven be able to see how their noodles are made by hand.
Paula H.}Brooklyn, NY}65}167}2}-1}4}11/29/2005}Well, everyone loves Sobaya -- except me!  I mean, I can see why in many ways everyone loves it.  It's beautiful and very properly Japanese.  My Japanese ex drummer said she almost cried when she ate the food there because it reminded her of her mom's home cooking.  My friends whom I went there with tonight both loved what they got.  Maybe I just made bad choices, but I didn't like the curry chicken or my dessert particularly.  Everything had a smoky taste as if the chef had been puffing cigarette smoke over it.  Of course I'm sure he hadn't, since it's illegal, but maybe, I don't know, his fingers?  The bathroom was very beautiful and the service was perfectly flawless.  Maybe I'll be persuaded to make a return visit and make a better choice next time.
Laurea D.}Brooklyn, NY}104}25}0}-1}4}8/9/2005}Eat here if you want a well prepared bowl of noodles or a rice dish with high quality fish. The soba and udon broth here is very strong but not overbearing. I recommend the tuna in garlic sauce over rice. The tuna melts in your mouth, and it is served with a small bowl of broth with enoki mushrooms. During late fall or winter, fresh, delicious Kumamoto oysters are available as an appetizer. All of this fantastic Japanese food also comes with an extensive Sake menu that features charts that describe the dryness and sweetness of each bottle of Sake featured.

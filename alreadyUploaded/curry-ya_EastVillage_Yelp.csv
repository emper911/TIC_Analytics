Shavonn V.}New York, NY}23}5}4}-1}1}5/8/2018}Food good but stingy for price paid 24 for 1 piece of shrimp and extra veggiesNo help wit helping me either
Allie G.}Manhattan, NY}8}47}78}-1}5}5/5/2018}We were intending to go to Hanoi House but didn't realize they don't serve lunch on Saturday's. Won't lie the door/entry gave me doubts but we were beyond amazed. It is so hard to find Katsu in NYC let alone great Pork Katsu. Such a gem, hole in the wall and could not recommend it more!!! Get the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry, unreal.
Huy N.}Houston, TX}5}156}275}18}5}4/27/2018}I got the dry curry: beef curry with celery,onion,raisins, hard boiled eggs, with extra topping of chicken katsu w/white rice. Well played and delicious. Flavorful curry with a hint of sweetness. My wife got the plain curry with extra topping of tempura shrimp w/ white rice. Her curry is simple and light. The shrimp tempura was so good, I took a bite of it and the shrimp tasted really fresh, hot and crispy. Tokyo blend coffee is nice as well, before the milk and sugar water added in the black coffee was light and aromatic.Overall great experience, the ladies that served us was nice. It's a small place but has a nice feel to it.
Calvin L.}Manhattan, NY}208}78}236}18}3}4/27/2018}Came here on a Friday evening around 6:30 and it wasn't too packed yet. The restaurant is small with only bar seating. I would say this is comparable to Abiko Curry in Ktown - a much higher end version of curry with a good selection of toppings to choose from.I ordered the "dry" curry ($14) - ground beef with chopped onions , carrots, celery, raisins, and a hard boiled egg. The flavor was pretty good, but it was a pretty simple dish. I think next time I will probably try one of the other dishes and pay the extra $5.50 for the baked egg and topped with melted cheddar cheese.Overall, it's nothing special, but worth trying once if you're in the area. St Marks tends to get pretty crowded on weekends, but if you go just before the dinner rush, the lines shouldn't be too bad.
Emily J.}Arlington, VA}4}48}61}-1}5}4/21/2018}Great Japanese curry with wonderfully cooked rice. The place is tiny and service is good. Additional pickled veggie on the desk - help yourself as much as you want. Didn't plan to come here but end up having a really enjoyable Saturday lunch.
Eric H.}New York, NY}173}77}96}-1}4}4/3/2018}Curry-Ya offers a very simple and basic menu, delicious curry, rice, over fried meat. This specific location has limited seating but the service is great and the food is good. I ordered the Chicken Katsu, it comes with 3 pieces of beans because you gotta have veggies too right? The curry is comfort food, you won't feel full but you will leave happy. If you need your curry fix, this place will hit the spot!
Yuka Y.}Brookline, MA}427}335}1116}18}4}3/29/2018}Curry-Ya is a higher end Japanese curry restaurant in East Village compared to fast food establishments like Go Go Curry. Recs: (+++) Any baked curry of your choice. For only $5.50 extra to spruce up your curry with baked cheese and egg on top, this is their selling point and what makes their establishment truly unique. Served in a cast iron pot, the sizzling outer cheese crust is a delight for the eyes, ears, and mouth. Your curry will remain piping hot for a much longer duration. They are not kidding with their hamburg steak- having it baked, there was more hamburg steak than rice! (++) Berkshire pork katsuOrder it spicy if you're a fan. The curry is served separately in a genie-like stainless steel container giving you full on control how much sauce you want. You know you're at a legit Japanese curry shop when they readily offer amazuke rakkyo (sweet pickled shallots) and fukujinzukke (red pickles) on every table as condiments. Yum!Interior: It's very narrow and cramped for space. Bar seating only. Not a place for large groups unless you come at an odd hour.
Lexi R.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}112}25}64}-1}5}3/24/2018}Place is very very small! I had the baked chicken curry and it was so good. Definitely filling if you hadn't eaten all day like me. Only con is when I offered the guy my yelp coupon he said they no longer use this service
Vicky L.}New York, NY}162}4}4}-1}5}2/20/2018}My favorite curry place! I really like the baked curry with cheese and egg on the top! So amazing!
Stacy Y.}New York, NY}2}33}11}-1}5}2/16/2018}My favorite curry spot! The space is a little cramped but the curry is so flavorful. I love the baked curry. It is the ultimate comfort food.
Grace Y.}New York, NY}214}207}586}18}3}2/7/2018}Way overpriced for even a basic curry dish. Small place with only a couple of seats at a bar. I got the regular curry and it was nothing special. I even asked for hot but it didn't taste spicy at all. Meh.
Anna W.}Manhattan, NY}34}9}22}-1}5}2/4/2018}A warming Japanese Curry is all you want in a winter day. The flavour is great, I especially like their rice, slightly sticky Japanese rice. Try their pork Katsu and sausage too!
Jocelyn K.}Jersey City, NJ}443}810}4544}18}4}1/31/2018}I have put off coming here for a while, so I'm happy that I eventually tried it. The space is cramped and can seat roughly 14 people only. I came during lunch and we managed to snag 4 seats. The restaurant is set up with a bar-like table around the kitchen. It's fun watching them make the curry as you wait. We were lucky and sat right in front of the two cooks.I ordered the medium spicy Vegetable Medley Curry ($13) with an added mini chicken katsu ($4.50). It also came with a salad with tomatoes, peppers, and  vinegary dressing. The vegetable curry comes with kabocha, carrots, and potatoes. There was only a hint of spiciness. I'm guessing the hot wouldn't be that hot either. The chicken katsu was really juicy and freshly fried. I'm happy that they use dark meat. I was only going to eat a part of the rice and curry, but it was so addicting I ended up eating the whole thing. Really delicious and comforting meal in the dead of winter.
Frank L.}Orlando, FL}8}34}13}18}5}1/26/2018}Delicious curry, attentive staff, small cozy placeI was stationed in Okinawa Japan and we would eat Japanese curry weekly, we were addicted to it. Coming back to the States I always try to find it but it's not a popular item so I can really only find it in big cities. A military buddy if mine brought me here, warning me it was NYC and tight but that it's pretty good.I got the chicken katsu with vegetables and spicy. It's hard to find Japanese curry let alone with added veggies so I was pretty stoked. They serve the plate with chicken and rice and then bring you a small cast iron pot of the curry. The curry was perfect and the "spicy" is not that bad. Maybe a number 4 at cocoichibanya. You can add more spice if you need it.They also have the pickled veggies (fukujinzuke) on the counter and tables. If you don't know then try them, I like to mix them in with my curry. They are a little sweet and crunchy.I really wanted to give this place a 4 star but they were so fast and attentive and being cold out so cozy crammed in with the other patrons I didn't mind it.
Kate R.}Queens, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}1/16/2018}Small spot in the east village with seating around the bar. Yummy yummy curry and great value for what you get.  Service perfect not over the top or pushy.
Alyson Y.}New York, NY}326}124}181}18}4}1/3/2018}Come here for baked curry!! Small restaurant in East Village. It's only bar seating and can fit around 10-15 people. Bright, white interior. It's basically curry with different meat options and toppings. I recommend adding the cheese! Plus, it's a free cheese topping if you check in on Yelp. The baked curry is made to-order. It's curry on top of a bed of rice with cheese and an egg on top. $5.50 on top of whatever curry dish you are ordering so it is a bit pricey (over $20). I got the pork katsu baked curry. Huge potion - I could comfortably share it with another person. The baked curry can only be made mild but you can ask for extra spice on the side. The yolk also runs into the rice which is delicious. The katsu isn't as crunchy which makes sense bc it's been baked and under curry. I would come definitely come back here for the curry!!
Rocanovasta G.}New York, NY}36}134}161}-1}2}1/2/2018}Fair level of taste. Not horrible, just par. Coming from someone who has had amazing curry all over the world... this rating probably is a strict one. Normal foodies may rate it a 3...Chicken is dark chicken, over fried. Beef croquet is a bit strong in smell. Regardless, it is not a bad place.
Manpreet K.}Grenoble, France}81}4}6}-1}5}12/31/2017}This is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to. The dishes are limited to curry dishes, so it's not a sushi place. They serve brilliant katsu curries and their signature plain curry-ya. This place was a delightful hot dinner on a cold evening. It's a small and snug place and the customers are seated around the kitchen area. Only 10 customers can fit at a given time!
Martin O.}Oxnard, CA}0}3}4}-1}5}12/29/2017}This place is bomb. Loved it. Highly recommend it. Have it baked. It is really good. This can be a bit pricey but you won't be disappointed. Pretty small so you may have to wait.
Richard N.}Long Island City, New York, NY}2}29}39}-1}3}12/18/2017}Neat little place to have Japanese curry with a friend. It's not capital-A authentic in terms of quality and taste, so I'm a bit disappointed by the price.Avoid having your curry "baked" as they seem to not account for the extra cooking time: the katsu ends up stringy/tough, and the cheese is largely not discernible.The curry itself is very reminiscent of Japanese curry, but isn't quite as thick and spicy. To their credit, they serve it piping hot inside of casserole pots, and provide typical condiments like pickled radish.They also have a bidet in their bathroom!
Jackie O.}New York, NY}5}48}10}-1}5}12/11/2017}I love Japanese curry and always looking for the best! Curry-Ya is small (10-15 max) with only counter/bar seating, so get there early or order take out.I always get the chicken katsu curry and you have the choice of spicy levels for the curry. I always get spicy and it's not bad at all because it's more pepper based versus spicy oils. The meal comes with a good portion of rice and chicken katsu with 3 string beans, then the curry separately so you can dip and pour over to your liking. Then they have these amazing garlic chips you can sprinkle all over!The berkshire pork is just as good then they have the baked curry, which comes in almost like a cocotte style (very heavy so be hungry to get it). Overall it's my favorite go to Japanese curry spot!
Nessa N.}Manhattan, NY}132}213}3}-1}4}12/4/2017}This is such a cute hole-in-the-wall place. The seating is mostly around the bar. It's nice and clean even thought it's small. I like how straightforward the menu is - just pick your curry. It's a great for getting comfort food.
Zachary T.}New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}1}11/30/2017}Sauce is sweet which is fine since I enjoy that. Portion size of the actual food is tiny. I counted the beef cubes since I was wondering where all the meat was when I had such a big sauce cup. It came with a grand total of 5. Amount of veggies was also pretty small. I'm a big eater so while other people might get full from eating the rice, I came out unsatisfied even though I ordered a side of chicken Katsu. Came in when it was empty so nothing to add regarding service. 1 star isn't because the food itself was bad but because I don't think the value for your dollar is there.
Sijia Z.}New York, NY}284}23}43}-1}2}11/30/2017}If you want some authentic Japanese curry, this is not the place to go. It looks very similar to Japanese curry but tastes much milder. Even though I tried the hot curry which my friend ordered, it wasn't spicy at all.My order, Vegetable Medley Baked Curry: the outside of egg yolk was overcooked, while part of the egg white was raw. As for the curry, I asked to opt out pumpkin, but they didn't. Not a big deal. But it was under-seasoned, not enough spices. The cheese added a bit of savory flavor to the curry and made it richer, but didn't make up for the under-seasoned curry.
Keloko A.}Manoa, Honolulu, HI}0}19}0}-1}1}11/19/2017}I have to say overall it was a horrifying experience. Food was okay, although it didn't live up to the expectation, given the prices they charge. My problem was with the staff. Honestly speaking I didn't have much experience with Japanese curry. I had a question about my food and I was responded to in a quite uncomfortable way, as if I should be an expert in Japanese curry just because I'm Asian. What was worse is, halfway into my meal, a white guy came in, asked a bunch of questions about the food and drinks, and the waiter just answered them patiently and friendly, instead of responding with a pause followed by a rhetorical question, like they did mine.I think this is an example of internalized racism in the restaurant industry, and I think maybe their staff needs to be better aware of that.
Layla R.}Philadelphia, PA}56}12}0}-1}4}11/15/2017}Just tried the Japanese Classic for the first time and I was extremely pleased! The curry was thick, very rich and had a great taste to it. I love the pumpkin and potato taste. Got take out so can't comment on the service, but I did use a card to pay. My only negative was that the take out portion was small, although I did order through MealPal so that may be why (only three pieces of meat in the curry). Very heavy smell inside the place when I went to pick up, but in a good way (in my opinion). I would love to come back for the sit-down experience.
Andrew C.}New York, NY}162}115}160}18}5}11/15/2017}A friend brought me here for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised at the place. First off, this place only has a bar counter. For some it may be an issue but to me, I think it adds to the cozy home feeling the place exudes. For those who haven't had Japanese curry before, it's different from the traditional curry in that it's more sweet than spicy. My friend ordered the veggie curry but I ordered the berkshire katsu with a side of chicken katsu with mild curry. Boy was I joyous as I watched them make my food and almost jumped when it came (I was also starving). The food was decently sized, enough for a normal person. The pork katsu was nice and crispy, the chicken juicy. They paired really well with the curry sauce. The sauce was a good combination of sweetness with that hint of spice (mainly because I got the mild) and it just really sated my curry craving that day. For those who wants a more spicier than sweet flavor, opt for medium or hot. The only thing is, the food here is a bit pricy. My meal alone came out to about $23 before tax and tip but worth it! This place here is really quality over quantity and the price is worth it. Pop into this place if you're in the mood for Japanese curry.
Mich M.}Manhattan, NY}15}75}527}18}1}11/12/2017}The Chicken Curry sauce tastes like ketchup. It has no curry taste or aroma at all. And we ordered this one Hot, it tastes the same as the mild one, not hot at all. The chicken is good though; tender. I ordered a Japanese Classic, Hot. It was not hot at all. I thought it was just me until I saw the receipt and it reads "Mild." They messed up! The Japanese Classic doesn't taste like curry either. I know someone who doesn't cook makes better curry than this. My brother who is not a picky eater at all says "curry is supposed to taste good, if this is what curry taste like..." He didn't finish the sentence. He proceed to say that "Indian curry, Malaysian's curry, our mom's curry fish ball, and any curry tastes better than this with just a tiny bit of effort. They didn't put effort in their curry at all." It was so acidic that it feels like my skin peeled off from the roof of my mouth. My brother said the same thing. I like sour food; I eat fresh lemon slices occasionally. But this was a different kind of sour, not a tasty one. The sour food made us so hungry that after spending $30 here we went straight to Go!Go Curry on Thompson St. Oh and this is really important for people who dress nice, eating here will stink up your clothes.
Mandy K.}New York, NY}0}16}11}-1}2}11/4/2017}I came all the way here and they do not serve the baked curry anymore after 10pm. It's extremely frustrating when they don't put it on their website.
Gianni L.}New York, NY}1054}107}9}18}4}11/1/2017}Two words- baked. curry. Who knew this was a thing? I sure didn't, and definitely had to order it- it comes with egg and cheese. Takes a while, but it's very well worth! My friends and I stumbled upon this place after seeing that the line for Hi-Collar, which is right next door, was too long. What a great find indeed! The restaurant is set up as a bar, so this place may not be the best for a big group!The food itself is very good but the price scares me off- $22 for curry, rice, and chicken. This is a place I definitely would recommend you trying but not sure if I will come back again.
Claire J.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}6}5}-1}5}10/30/2017}Definitely love this place. Im always willing to travel to east village just because of going this place. My boyfriend and I both are such a curry-lover, and we are enjoying to have their curry as "simple meal" on the weekend. My all time favorite of this place is baked curry! Love here!
Veronica P.}Manhattan, NY}0}14}1}-1}1}10/29/2017}Terrible curry, they don't cut the fat and cartilage off the chicken $15, salad $5 is not included, too expensive for the poor quality. I like Wagamama's Chicken Katsu Curry better, on 3rd Ave and 11th Street, their curry is amazing, chicken is super tender, and salad is included for $14 total!
Elisa H.}Brooklyn, NY}1577}428}868}18}5}10/27/2017}Their pork Katsu "baked". Any meat "BaKed" is the only way to go. Baked means crammed into a cast iron rice casserole and topped with a fried egg, smothered in cheese and curry, baked to bubbling so that the curry-egg-cheese swirly scalds your tongue and burns the roof of your mouth- and u keep begging for it to do it again. Simple, yet rich, and teeming with flavor, fragrance, heat and texture, the combination of these very 5 ingredients is short of mind-blowing. We also had the seafood and rice curry, unBaked, unfortunately. It was ok but not something to write about.The Take-away: try a meat curry baked now. Tonight, if not sooner. It will change the way you look at curry, cheese, egg with rice and how none of which makes sense, yet somehow, can all be best friends. Oh, we also did a favor: skip the seafood because it's texture and integrity just wouldn't hold up curry the same way hamburger, pork or chicken Katsu would.
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}5}10/14/2017}Always good food and good customer service. Has recommended to others as well. Love the hamburger curry!
Jen S.}Port Jefferson, NY}2}8}0}-1}5}10/6/2017}I love katsu curry and this place does it right! Usually the curry sauces at other places are standard, but you can really taste the difference at Curry-Ya. The spice level can also be adjusted.
October W.}Manhattan, NY}69}1}0}-1}2}9/30/2017}The delivery is just too slow. I ordered it on 1:11pm and didn't get it after an hour when my hall is only one street away from this restaurant.
Anran M.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}1}2}-1}5}9/8/2017}Just discovered this restaurant on our way from UN headquarters to home. It's quite near, and the Japanese classic curry is tasty as it looks. You can choose how spicy the curry is.
乃馨}New York, NY}48}74}304}-1}5}9/2/2017}This place has been my take-out place for so long. It's a little bit pricey but I really enjoy their curry. Everything is good and I especially recommend curry with pumpkin. Baked curry didn't give me too many surprises.
Patrick N.}New York, NY}265}203}690}18}4}8/15/2017}I came here on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. It's a cozy restaurant with only bar tables. The menu is simple and I ordered a curry Berkshire pork katsu. The katsu was thick and juicy with the perfect amount of breading. Curry had good aroma but could use more vegetable.
Guangrong C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}175}44}9}-1}3}8/13/2017}Nothing too spectacular. Would go here for a quick bite but not if I wanted to impress a friend.
Jeff S.}Oak Park, IL}33}339}708}18}5}8/6/2017}Hands-down the best Katsu Curry I've had outside Japan. Perfectly fried cutlet with zero fat. Walking in the door to sit at this bar-only establishment was even reminiscent of Tokyo. Make sure to ask for some extra picked Ginger on the side.
Nisarga M.}New York, NY}137}172}107}18}4}8/5/2017}*no vegetarian curries, beware!*Came here to try a Japanese curry. Ordered a drink and while ordering food realized all the curries have chicken/beef base in them. Including the "vegetarian" ones. Heads up to people who are strict non-meat eaters, as  the menu doesn't mention this. Had to leave without eating anything :( The service was great though, I wish I was a meat eater so I could savor those yummy looking curries!
Alyssa T.}Houston, TX}1}17}20}-1}4}8/4/2017}Delicious chicken katsu curry! The shop is small and cute. The staff are very efficient and get your food to you quickly. I like their concept of putting the curry in a separate dish. The katsu breading doesn't get soggy that way! There are 3 levels are spicy: mild, medium, and hot. Their starter salad is refreshing and their red pickled radish compliments the curry. I would love to go here again!
Billy C.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}400}189}723}18}3}7/18/2017}Ended up coming here late night and the popular baked curry dish was sold out. I was hungry, so anything would suffice. I opted to order the Berkshire pork cutlet curry and I was sadly disappointed. I'll explain: Place: small, narrow, counter style seating spot. If you're a big person and someone needs to walk to the bathroom, you'll probably get bumped. Overall, they utilize the minimalistic approach. Service: I was the last customer! It was great! Food: Berkshire pork cutlet curry - I've had my fair share of Japanese curry spots and I was not impressed with the: presentation, the curry sauce & the dry pork chop. Maybe it was because it was the end of the night...but nonetheless it was upsetting. When you take a look at my photo, you'll see how bland the presentation is. They threw couple of pieces of veggies on the dish and that's it. The curry sauce is from a big pot that was refrigerated. They boil it in small staub pots which are real cute and then brought in front of you to self serve out of it. The sauce had no depth of flavor and it tasted watered down. The pork cutlet was fried in front of me, so I know it's fresh but once I took a bite into it, the meat itself was dry.  How?! Why?! I was looking forward to eating delicious Japanese curry !. I would have to come back at a normal hour to try this again or to try the baked curry to see if it lives up to the rest of the reviews but for now I will stick with this rating.
Ken W.}ELMHURST, NY}2}8}0}-1}4}7/15/2017}I dragged one of my friends there with me a while ago. It's great curry, which I like to have my plate soaked. It's not too spicy or watery. Looking forward to going back again when I have an opportunity to go with someone.
Michelle L.}Quincy, MA}131}38}11}-1}4}7/11/2017}The server was attentive, and the food was delicious. I ordered the Japanese classic. The portion was just the right amount for me. It's definitely comfort food. I would just say the price is a bit high, but you're getting your money's worth.
Marisa C.}Menlo Park, CA}0}96}0}-1}5}7/6/2017}I don't think I ate a lot of Japanese food while I was in NYC, but when I did, it was to get curry here. LOVE their curry!My friends and I came here quite often, it became the hangout for us. Their curry is delicious, and I usually get the chicken katsu or the hamburger curry. Meat is always moist and the curry is always flavorful, there really is nothing to complain about. I also get the oven baked version, which only makes the food taste that much better, it's seriously that amazing Their portions are generous that I'm seriously stuffed by the end of my meal. I often start with their seaweed salad as well, because it's delicious. I especially love the dressing, it's a must try if you've never had it.Staff is always polite and friendly, and they're always on top of getting you seated and making sure you get your food quickly. It's a small place so there's very limited seating and sometimes the wait has gotten long, but it's well worth it, I assure you. Prices are comparable, I think it's just right for what you get.Overall, great curry! I love coming here with my friends and I think I'm going to have to come back when I visit NYC!
Deborah W.}Manhattan, NY}180}92}157}18}4}7/1/2017}Note: They take credit cards now!My friend and I came 5 PM on a Friday night because we were worried it would fill up if we go later. The restaurant was completely empty and only started filling up after we left past 5:30 PM. The restaurant is small and cozy. The chairs are a bit small and squish everyone together so definitely try to make it in early. However, the restaurant itself was clean and tidy which is a nice environment. The staff was very friendly and since we were the first ones in the restaurant they took our order and got our food to us very quickly. I ordered the pork katsu curry and got a hard boiled egg on the side. The curry comes separate from the rest of the meal so you get to drizzle it onto the food yourself. The curry was absolutely delicious, such nice comfort food. The pork katsu was also really good, the meat was great and had a small amount of fat to it giving it a nice juicy texture. The main issue I had with the restaurant is the cost.  That plate in addition to tip came out to be over $20.00. It is a little difficult for me to justify paying $20.00 for curry even if it was good but it came with a good amount of food so I felt stuffed when I left. Which is always a plus! Pros:-Food taste-Food portion -Good fast serviceCons:-Small, Crowded (make sure to get there early!)-Cost
James D.}Brooklyn, NY}0}37}0}-1}5}6/23/2017}This place was fantastic. Went there on a Saturday night, surprisingly not very busy so we sat down right away. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the baked seafood curry and a side of pork sausage. It was DELICIOUS. So so good, and very reasonably priced. Will definitely eat here again.
Ellie O.}Manhattan, NY}11}55}43}-1}3}6/13/2017}It was a cute small restaurant where there is only about 15 seats. It's an open kitchen and you can see the chefs cooking the food. I had the classic curry with the croquette. The way they present the curry is really different and each person gets their own pot of curry which is cool. In terms of taste for both the curry and the croquette, it was nothing special but gets the job done at the very least in terms of Japanese curry satisfaction.
Anna K.}ブルックリン, NY}53}8}20}-1}5}6/12/2017}Chicken katsu curry baked is really good!!!!!Actually I like Dry curry as well.
Michelle K.}New York, NY}7}5}13}-1}5}6/4/2017}Best Japanese curry in the city. So glad it is near Metrograph movie theater. Easy to make it dinner and a movie. Making plans to check out uptown location. Very tiny space but worth squeezing in or taking out.
Cee V.}New York, NY}4}29}5}-1}3}6/2/2017}Not the best thing I tasted in NY, tried it because it was hype beast and everyone talks abt it but it seems like a typical place to me.
Patrick Y.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}49}71}117}18}4}5/30/2017}First time trying Japanese Curry and I am not disappointed. The place serves great food that is very filling for it's price. A little more than other places I've heard of, but the curry tastes great. I went with a group and tried a majority of the plates. It seems to me as if they're great all around the menu. From shrimp to beef, it was all great and a great experience. Servers are nice and the food was quick and simple.
Crystal P.}New York, NY}92}18}33}-1}5}5/19/2017}This place was small and quiet. The food was absolutely amazing I wish I would've taken a picture but I was starving. I will def be there again.
Rain 1.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}2}5/17/2017}Food was okay. The Berkshire pork did not taste fresh and the waitress was very rude.
Joshua U.}Jersey City, NJ}0}5}4}-1}4}5/10/2017}Its a fun quick fix for curry. I had the Housemade Hamburger Curry which was spot on. It was prepared and served in front of you so you know that you're getting the good stuff. Id come back again soon for another curry fix
Lawrence C.}Scotch Plains, NJ}5}24}0}-1}4}5/10/2017}My favorite Japanese Curry place. Have had the Berkshire pork cutlet, chicken cutlet, pan fried chicken, beef, and dried curry.They're all good though the dried curry is my least favorite. Generally I would say adding the $5 to get it baked with egg and cheese is totally worth it adding additional richness to the flavor of the curry. I would like to add the beef curry tastes like the beef must have been cooked with wine.It's a bit pricy but at the same time I feel they don't have that much competition for curry. Or at least I did not like any other place as much so far.The place is pretty small but I still say worth eating there with the curry piping hot
Clare L.}Chicago, IL}31}6}3}-1}4}5/2/2017}Very good curry!! I've tried the pork katsu $16 and chicken katsu, seafood and Japanese classic. They are all well done. It's a very tiny place but they have Japanese servers. It's a worth tried place!
P H.}Jerome Park, NY}10}55}25}-1}5}5/1/2017}Cute little restaurant, very pleasant employees. I mean the service is great. And the food tastes fresh ! I got the curry chicken katsu with white rice and it was so yummy. :)
Su L.}Manhattan, NY}79}121}437}18}4}5/1/2017}Delicious and affordable curries. The restaurant is small, with bar style seating. I had the baked curry, which was their signature dish, with chicken katsu. The curry and egg had been baked, forming a hard top, encasing the rice underneath. The rice was moist and had a firm texture. The curry also included cheese and egg, that was runny underneath the hard top.
Grace Q.}Seattle, WA}183}14}29}-1}3}4/23/2017}SUMMARY: Good comforting curry, just nothing that memorable. But it satisfies curry cravings and has good service. Would definitely come back again and try other stuff, perhaps the more adventurous dishes better represent this place!TIME: A little before 6, I remember because we tried to go somewhere else but nearby Japanese restaurants weren't open for dinner yet. So, good on Curry-Ya for being open more often than their neighbors!SERVICE: We were helped right away; we were the only customers at the time. Food service was attentive and professional but not too involved.FOOD:- Japanese Classic Cutty: good, but nothing special.- Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry: good, but nothing special. The curry itself tasted just like normal Japanese curry but devoid of vegetables (I like my veg, would've preferred to have some instead of the three sad green beans placed on my plate as shown in my pic.) The pork katsu was very crispy and delicious. I loved the little cast iron bowls that the curry came in and the accompanying mat and ladle, it felt very put together versus other places where they slap some curry on some rice on a plate.DRINKS: n/aAMBIENCE: Seems like a place with a fast turnover so it's a nice place for a quick meal. Not sure how it would feel when there are more people since we were the only customers at the time; the place is small.
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}2}4/19/2017}I think NYC is one of the few places in the world where a restaurant can get away with selling a mound of rice and curry sauce for $9. They threw in a house salad, but I really don't know how they get away with it! I ordered the plain curry because I wasn't in the mood to spend more than $10 on lunch, and anything including meat was at least $15. I chose the medium spiciness level, knowing that it would be hotter than I am used to, but needing that extra fire in my belly to warm up. The curry tasted fine, and served its purpose in warming me up. From what I could tell (disclaimer: I do not have a very discerning palate for curry) it tasted better than the typical boxed curry squares that you can make curry from at home. However, whether or not it was truly made from scratch from beef stock, I cannot say for sure. I did appreciate that the curry made for a really fast meal, which is convenient if you are on the go. However, I stand by my 2.5 star review given the exorbitant price for a common dish that could easily be prepared at home for a fraction of the cost.They do take credit card now, which seems to be an improvement given previous reviews.
Jake L.}New York, NY}0}34}0}-1}5}4/19/2017}Tiny space but amazing food & staff! Their chicken curry cutlet is so tasty. Feels like you're in Japan. Have eaten here many times and will be back for more. Keep up the great work!
Elise K.}Tempe, AZ}375}212}180}-1}5}4/16/2017}I absolutely loved eating here when in New York! I got the curry bake which is a baked dish with rice, katsu, cheese & egg! It was soooo good. We got here pretty much right when they opened because it is a really small place that is created like a bar.
Christine S.}Bloomfield, NJ}0}1}0}-1}5}3/28/2017}Consistently good food! Better to go with cash and during the day (before 6:30) to catch seats.
Jamie N.}Manhattan, NY}4}20}14}-1}2}3/28/2017}I have always liked curry ya. But today i ordered one of the most expensive dish, 16$ plus extra shrimp & sausage which is literally smaller than one bite, the whole thing cost 22$ and when it arrived it didnt have any vegetable in it like it always does. Very disappointed. When i called all the server had to say was oh we never include it. Uh huh. But then i always had it in my take away orders. Seriously though, for that price you wont even include a bit of vegetable in it?And the meat doesnt even taste as good as it aways is. Much drier than usual.
Gabby G.}DUMBO, Brooklyn, NY}4}12}16}-1}5}3/9/2017}Love this place!! So far the best Japanese curry in New York City. I preferred to get the classic curry with a side of vegetarian croquettes and a mini chicken kutsu. You can even specify how hot you want your curry. During lunch you get a complementary salad; and the dressing they use is absolutely delicious. Can't tell you much about the other curry they have, because the classic curry has vegetables and beef in it and it's completely perfect. So why get anything else? The chicken Kutsu is amazing and it's perfectly crunchy and moist. There potato croquettes are like crunchy fluffy pillows, and they go so damn well with the curry. When I come here I make sure I'm hungry.The staff is very nice and friendly, and seem willing to help with any questions. The place is a little small with limited seating. But very worth the wait.
Patricia B.}Long Island, NY}2}6}16}-1}5}3/6/2017}Food: I love how they have the curry in a big gravy boat dish so you could put however much you want. If that isnt enough, you can also order extra curry on the side. The curry is available in 3 spice levels: mild, medium, and spicy. You can add toppings to the curry which is pretty bomb but I didnt get to try it since it was my first time at the place so original for me. The Berkshire Chicken Katsu Curry was very crispy and not overwhelming oily. The sauce was my favorite part, i ordered mild but it had a bit of spice which i liked. I wish i could buy tubs of the curry to go for home. Service: the staff was attentive and friendly. I got to the place around 12:10 and they open at 12pm so I was the first customer of the day. My order came out faster than I expected (i still didnt even finish the salad that came with the lunch special). Location: it's located in the east village which is mecca for japanese food. The closest subway station is Astor Place which is about 4-5 blocks away from the place (East 10th Street and 2nd Avenue). The actual restaurant is a bit small with limited seating, so first come first served. There's one long counter thats the main seating area but there are also 2 seats facing the window in a little separated area. But i like how its counter seating so you actually see the staff cooking the food. There are hangers and hooks on the wall behind the seating so you can hang your coats and bags if it tends to get in the way. Price: reasonably priced portions. It's also CASH ONLY! The Lunch Special came with a salad and i ordered the Berkshire Chicken Katsu Curry which came out to be around $15. I would definitely recommend coming here at least once to try the curry. I know I'll be going back to try Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry with toppings!!
Jamie Y.}Flushing, NY}296}11}1}-1}4}3/4/2017}a bit pricy for what it is as well as considering its cash only, yet this place it totally worth going to. its an intimate, mostly bar seating restaurant with high quality, comfort food curry. I got the baked beef curry which was a total win: food came out piping hot with large portions. I was definitely stuffed by the end. Places like this is a bit pricy, yet if i was in the area more often I would definitely be a regular visitor.
Patrick Y.}Los Angeles, CA}185}101}10}-1}5}2/22/2017}I love coming here alone. It's bar seating, which is perfect for solo diners. The shop is extremely small and cozy, so you get to see them prepare your meal behind the counter.The katsu here is amazingly crispy and thick, but not dry at all. The curry is topped with fresh vegetables, so you don't feel bad about eating fried katsu.During lunch, you get a free salad!I highly recommend getting a lychee or plain lassi. It's bomb. The sweet and sour flavor pairs great with the heavy curry and fried katsu.
Alexis P.}New York, NY}280}173}38}-1}4}2/12/2017}We walked over here on a cold rainy Sunday afternoon, originally intending to feast on a hearty brunch at hi collar. However there was a line out the door and their "no-name-taking" system discouraged us. Luckily, curry-ya next door was wide open! Usually when I walk past, it's always packed.Two of my friends ordered the baked curry with pork katsu, and I ordered the dry beef curry with a side of fried shrimp. One of the beers tempted me so I got one of them as well, which went great with the curry (the unfiltered red amber).Honestly, if you ain't planning on going there often... GET THE BAKED CURRY.It's a bit unexpectedly pricy ($21), but you'll enjoy the hell out of it. It's cheesy, it's meaty, it's curry-y... I took a bite of it and immediately regretted getting the dry curry, although it was good.it's so much effing food, you will have a meal's worth of leftovers afterwards if you're not being gluttonous (or if you're not like me, who finished all of my own curry and started stealing all my friends baked curry).They also deliver!!!! Swooonn
Ramit F.}Belle Mead, Belle Mead, NJ}0}4}1}-1}5}2/3/2017}perfect tiny place to eat. tried the chicken and pork katsu....fresh! and the curry is amazing!
Kevin E.}Brooklyn, NY}81}544}817}18}3}2/1/2017}3.5 starsHad this place bookmarked for ages and finally got to try it today. It's a pretty small restaurant and there's only bar seating available but we had no trouble finding seats at 12 on a Wednesday. I really wanted to get the baked Berkshire pork katsu but the baked version is $5 extra so I just got the regular version for $16. The pork katsu was average. It was a little on the dry side and wasn't as crispy as I had wanted it to be. Not bad but the katsu at Kingza in Flushing is still my favorite. The curry, on the other hand, was awesome! Thick, creamy, and flavorful curry served inside a gravy boat. You have the option of choosing the spicyness level. I opted for medium and I thought it was the perfect amount of spiciness. Literally was so tempted to lick the gravy boat clean cause it was so tasty. Overall, the curry here is really good but the katsu was just alright. Prices are kinda high too. You can get a cheaper katsu curry at Udon West a few blocks away but they give less meat there. Glad I finally got to try this place though.
Jennifer Y.}New York, NY}162}79}36}18}5}1/30/2017}This is the curry place I have been looking for! Ultimate Japanese comfort food, especially on a long winter day. Place is small, CASH ONLY. They only have one counter where they serve everything out of, very Japanese-styled.I always get the Vegetable Medley with mini Pork Katsu. That way I get all the vegetables and the delicious crispy Katsu. They serve it right in front of you in a hot cast-iron pot, so you can enjoy scooping all the goodness onto your rice plate and indulge with warm fuzzy feelings. They have a baked curry as well, that's a bit heavier but has the top portion crusted over with the rice on bottom. There's delivery as well, though I haven't tried it. It seems just as good though, since I can see them preparing it alongside the meal orders.They've got a small Japanese beer selection and sake. It's a great little place to drop by, as we usually do when we start to have curry cravings.
Jon S.}Brooklyn, NY}123}642}1}18}5}1/29/2017}Monday night I often am in the East Village looking for a relatively quick, slightly late dinner before heading back to Brooklyn.On an evening that was cold and damp, the idea of a Japanese curry was exciting. Curry-ya delivered on what I needed. It's a small spot, a not very long counter with a tiny kitchen next to it.  You can see your curry being heated up, and where they bake certain entries. The curry itself comes in a near boiling pot, one that the diner then dribbles over the rice. I also had a pork katsu with mine. It wasn't huge, but the combination of the heavy curry, which I got medium spicy, and rice made a nice meal.Japanese restaurants both in New York and Japan are endlessly explaining Japanese curry, how it is different from Indian curries and how it is comfort food for the Japanese people. After dining here, it's a lot easier to understand why.After eating here I was admonished by a couple friends for not getting my curry baked. Now at the time I thought it might be a bit heavy or hot, but now I realize I was just being a bit scared. Next time, I'm definitely getting this.
Tracy N.}New York, NY}395}32}41}-1}5}1/28/2017}Love this curry place. Amazing vegetarian curry, seaweed salad, beef curry (japanese classic).I like adding the garlic flakes when I eat there too. Don't know if that's strange or normal. Like a lot of it.This place is great for dining in and for take out. It's the best. Love you :)
Rachelle R.}New York, NY}47}302}32}18}5}1/26/2017}Omg guys, I've never experienced Japanese curry so rich and flavorful! I got the medium spicy vegetable curry and was surprised at the mix of vegetables - potato, enoki mushrooms, green beans and acorn squash galore! For $12 I was more than satisfied with the perfect portion size and the pickle that comes with it is an added treat. They were super busy but really kind and efficient. Love this place, I will be back.
Ryan R.}New York, NY}691}1506}134}18}4}1/24/2017}Went here with a friend on a week night. The place is TINY--only bar seating, and probably only about 15 total.For my meal, I decided to go with the hamburger steak with extra veggies and brown rice. The hamburger steak was very good and the veggies, brown rice, and curry made for great additions. However, I have to say that the hamburger steak was a bit small for the price ($14), as it was no bigger than a regular burger patty.Overall, the service here is direct and friendly enough, though the food can take some time to come out, especially if you get the baked curry special. Don't let that discourage you though as the food (and the curry) is very tasty.
Annie C.}Brooklyn, NY}367}123}535}-1}4}1/22/2017}CASH ONLY!! I come here often for lunching sessions when I'm in the mood for Japanese curry and in the vicinity. The space itself is a bit cramped and provides only counter-seating with built in cubbies. My go-to is usually the Berkshire pork katsu curry ($16). The price is steeper than most curry dishes that I'm accustomed to paying but the portions are satisfying. The curry is usually consistent with its great depth of flavor and richness. As far as texture is concerned, the pork katsu never fails to add dimension to the dish. You can also customize your own curry entree by selecting a size, spice level, and addition of toppings at a supplementary cost. Overall, this spot makes it on my list of Japanese curries in NYC.
David K.}Manhattan, NY}61}98}107}-1}4}1/17/2017}Not the best curry I have ever had but pretty good and decent price. For the best curry I would go to midtown at Abiko Curry restaurant but this is good if I am in the area. It's a bit cramped in the restaurant but if you go during a non busy hour it should be fine.
Jinny P.}Manhattan, NY}1}72}0}-1}5}1/16/2017}Just devoured my pork katsu curry. Exactly what I wanted...nay, what I NEEDED. 15min faster than the expected delivery time too. Delicious and still crispy.
Alice L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}191}905}-1}4}1/13/2017}What I had: Baked chicken katsu curry - it's insanely hot when it arrives to you so be careful not to touch it immediately. It's loaded with cheese on top and an egg in the middle. Unfortunately my egg cooked all the way, would've been better if it was a runny egg or at least semi-runny. Just looking at its portion looks small, but it was more than enough for me. I couldn't finish the whole thing. It was very flavorful, the chicken was juicy and the rice was underneath everything, so it absorbed a lot of savory flavor. Dry beef curry along with a house made croquette - its nicely plated together. It taste amazing. It's it overly season nor is the curry too heavy. The croquette is super smooth and soft on the inside. Each bite you can hear the crunch from the crisp texture on the outside. Bottom line, both were very delicious.
Vivian T.}New York, NY}117}262}123}18}4}1/11/2017}Totally cute diner style restaurant that serves JAPANESE CURRY.  offers it in mild, medium, hot curry but you can add all sorts of stuff in in like fried Potato Croquettes or panko breaded pork chops.  I loved the dry curry (curry that is not as runny and comes with ground beef), seaweed salad, and yogurt lassi.  Totally delicious.  I want to order the baked curry that comes with curry on top of rice baked with cheese and an egg on top!! sounds totally awesome.  Come hungry and leave satisfied.
Cynthia W.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}0}3}3}-1}5}1/5/2017}My favorite curry place in NYC. I have been here for over 2 years and it is still one of my favorite restaurants in the city.
Lucy L.}New Haven, CT}8}132}571}-1}5}1/2/2017}Cannot express how deeply I love this place! We went there around 1pm but still had to wait, since it is such a popular place. I love the baked curry!!!! It was the second time here but I still want to bring more friends here!!!
石}Syracuse, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}12/27/2016}FUCK!!!!!!! Horrible janpanese food!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After eating their food We all throwed up three times and nearly died. We couldn't sleep all night and couldn't feel good in our later trip in New York city. Nightmare restaurant I've ever been!!!!!!!!
Lola P.}New York, NY}0}23}5}-1}5}12/23/2016}I love this place. This is my go to curry spot...probably have been here over five times the last few months. The baked curry is just so delicious, but unfortunately you can't add spice to it, only to the non-baked curry. I always leave full and happy. It's limited in seating but I usually get a spot right away when I come during lunch on the weekends. I just love the bar seating and open kitchen, reminds me of when I was in Japan.
Zuo C.}Miami, FL}0}2}0}-1}5}12/22/2016}Very small restaurant, but very delicious.You can choose to take away, cos it is probably to wait for seat. Pork or beef are both recommended.
Lance C.}New York, NY}92}8}5}-1}4}12/9/2016}ltadakemasu | the best Japanese curry in the neighborhood | Berkshire pork katsu is a real winner.
Sophia L.}Seattle, WA}3}25}3}-1}5}11/25/2016}Amazing Japanese curry place! It is small and cozy, very intimate. Coats have to hung up by the wall and there is a space in your stool for storing purses which is a very efficient use of space. The good is amazing. My half-Japanese boyfriend even loved it and he's picky with Japanese food haha The portions are decent. I recommend definitely getting sides with your food because just the rice and curry alone might not be very satisfying if you are extremely hungry. If you are only eating because it's dinner time and you're not super hungry, then by all means don't get any sides. The service was also quick and efficient. I don't think we stayed there for more than half an hour. But we also managed to get there before their rush hour so it really worked in our favor. Highly recommend, and it was so good I'm think about going a second time before my trip to NYC ends...
Benny L.}Staten Island, NY}43}159}10}-1}4}11/10/2016}Finally tried this place. Tonight was a good night for curry. Luckily there was room in the restaurant since it tends to be packed. Ordered the Berkshire pork with medium curry. The food came out fresh and hot. Almost burned my mouth since I couldn't wait to taste the curry. It definitely hit the spot. Curry had a nice kick with a good sweet taste. Pork was katsu was crispy and juicy like a steak. Service was fine and good quick meal.
Yooi K.}New York, NY}0}15}7}-1}5}11/7/2016}The Japanese style curry is very tasty, I've also recommended to my friend who also love it.
S K.}Fairfax, VA}70}33}11}-1}5}10/24/2016}I love all their curry. The berkshire pork is fried perfectly. I had it delivered and expected it to be a bit soggy, but it was perfect.
Reshard R.}Brooklyn, NY}50}211}600}18}4}10/16/2016}I have to be honest, I was skeptical of Japanese curry. I normally associated curry with all things Indian and British. But I'm so glad that I went because wow oh wow hold your britches. The rice was tender and perfectly cooked and crunchy, juicy chicken. There were three green beans only.... it was disturbing the ration.
Madeline P.}Manhattan, NY}377}61}22}-1}4}10/15/2016}This place is has the ultimate dream curry- japanese curry, hamburg steak topped with cheese and a yolky egg all oven-baked and sizzling hot!! My only complaint was that the egg, having been cooked in such a high temperature, was rubbery and hard. I would've requested a fried egg on top instead. Otherwise food is delicious but pricey, yet worth every penny.Cash only.
Jennifer Y.}Alhambra, CA}111}199}83}18}5}10/9/2016}First off, I am not a curry fan AT ALL. But after trying Curry-Ya, I've changed my mind. I want to say this is the best Japanese curry in the area. Hands down!! My fiancé has been coming to this place for a quick bite for years and raves about it to me all the time. He finally convinced me one day and here we are, ordering curry, together!!! I ordered the hamburger curry and he had the chicken katsu curry. Both were absolutely delicious! The staff were pretty attentive and polite throughout our entire meal. Looks like I will be returning to have more curry soon.
Catherine G.}Amsterdam, The Netherlands}351}3}0}-1}4}10/8/2016}Great curry! Cute place! I also had a great salad here as well. Well priced for the dishes.
Nicholas G.}Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY}953}111}34}-1}5}10/6/2016}I love Japanese curry and this place serves some of the best. It's a tiny little alley sized space with stools that have built in cubbies where you can store your purse. The curry is served in a tiny bubbling metal cauldron that you dump onto your rice and/or protein. The staff are all Japanese and Japanese people eat here which seems like a good indication that it's not inauthentic. There's an okay assortment of fine and strange imported soft and hard drinks, including one that is like watered down milk.If chicken katsu with curry is what you seek you can find it here and also choose the grade of spiciness you require from your curry. The place only seats around 15 people so I wouldn't bring a group or go during peak hours if you want to eat there. This is one of the only reasons to go to Manhattan.
Anna F.}Oklahoma City, OK}378}727}203}18}5}10/4/2016}This was one of my favorite meals during my recent trip to New York. It was recommended by a friend, and I'm so happy I took his recommendation! My meal was absolutely delicious. I'd never had Japanese curry before, and I can only describe it as a milder type of curry. It isn't like Thai or Indian curries. I had the chicken curry and added veggies. The lunch combo comes with a starter salad as well and the dressing is soooo good. I would eat here all the time if I lived nearby. There are only about 12 or so seats, so get there early before the lunch rush. I could tell everything was authentic as well because the restaurant had exclusively Asian customers while we were there.
Gregory F.}San Jose, CA}156}26}5}-1}1}10/4/2016}Smug staff. Apparently the curry is very very good. Curry is not vegetarian. I am a vegetarian and accompanied my carnivore friends, like a good friend. I ordered the yuba salad and veggie croquette. The staff was super smug and practically alienating me in Spanish (someone in my group speaks Spanish). I mean.. Ok it's strange I went to curry and didn't get curry. But a friend can't be a good friend by toughing it out by accompanying his friends that really wanted curry for dinner? Funny though... For a place that puts on a try-hard gimmick attempt at being set up like an actual Japanese shop, I could have easily been smug about some Spanish-speaking cooks and staff serving up Japanese curry in a try-hard wannabe authentic Japanese place. But no, I did not, so I don't expect to be snubbed by a bunch of non-Japanese-Spanish-speaking cooks n staff trying to serve up curry.At least talk smack in the kitchen hidden away. But when the kitchen area is right there in front of the guess, take your snobbery home and don't put it front of the customer. Yuba salad was pretty good, croquette was fine. They put meticulous effort to dress up the salad, but for the level of sophistication in flavor with a dash of snobbery, it was an okay salad.
Joanna M.}Brooklyn, NY}150}26}45}-1}5}10/3/2016}My boyfriend loves curry, so for national boyfriend day I brought him here. While I'm not a big fan of curry, i can see myself craving curry-ya's curry.I ordered the baked berkshire pork curry and my boyfriend ordered the baked hamburger steak curry. The baked berkshire pork curry was cheesy piping hot goodness :) ! The baked hamburger steak curry tasted even better. I think it's a matter of preference but the hamburger steak curry had its own distinct flavor. You can tell the hamburger steak really combined with the curry. I also ordered the lychee lassi which was pretty good. Not worth 7 dollars though haha.The place is pretty small but we didn't have to wait for seats. The service was great. Our servor was always smiling and very friendly.
Stefany W.}Manhattan, NY}196}181}15}18}2}9/26/2016}I was pretty excited about stopping here since I'd heard lots of good things and I love japanese curry.  Unfortunately my expectations were too high and I ended up being disappointed.First of all, the place is tiny - there were 4 of us and because the seats were bar style, it was difficult to have a conversation with everyone especially those who were sitting on the ends.  It was just awkward and uncomfortable.Secondly, I ordered the baked curry that was depicted as a runny egg with any kind of curry - I opted for the hamburger curry.  My sisters ordered the japanese classic and the regular hamburger curry with the other friend ordering the chicken katsu.  There were a lot of people going in and out and after waiting about 20 minutes, we noticed that another party of 4 who had arrived AFTER us, had already received their entire order.  So we asked the waitresses about our order and she told us that because we ordered the baked curry, it'll take longer.  There was NO mention about a longer wait time - if I was made aware of a longer wait time, then that's fine but there was no mention on the menu and the waitress didn't address it either when I ordered.  Not to mention, the curry itself was ALREADY pre-cooked so the baked curry is really for the egg to be semi cooked and that does NOT take 20 minutes or the actual 40 minutes (when our food finally came).  Plus, the egg was way overcooked - it was like they forgot that they had a baked curry going on.  I ordered the baked curry to get that runny egg NOT a well-done egg - it was so overcooked that it even had that hard film on the top.  The hamburger itself was also overcooked.  I ended up leaving most of the hamburger and just ate the curry sauce and the rice.  NOT WORTH the extra $5.  It was a waste of my time and money to order something that came out overcooked and dry.  Super disappointed - there are a lot of better curry places out there.
Josh A.}New York, NY}249}38}0}-1}4}9/22/2016}Curry-Ya is one of the more authentic Japanese curries I've had yet in NYC. However, it's a little on the pricey side for the amount of food you'll get (especially if you choose to get it baked.)  Definitely worth checking out, though, and consider popping into Chikalicious which is right down the block if you have a sweet tooth after your meal.Definitely don't forget cash as this is a cash-only establishment (unless you're ordering pick up--in that case you're good to go, no pun intended.)
J Y.}Newark, NJ}52}3}3}-1}4}9/17/2016}Good flavor, but they mixed up on curry.  I was suppose get medium and my kid get the mild kind.
Andrea T.}Redondo Beach, CA}382}109}109}18}5}9/16/2016}Oh my lanta this place was heaven to my taste buds!!! My mouth is watering at the thought of their chicken katsu curry. This place is a MUST if you love Japanese curry (which I do).I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry with vegetables and it exceeded my expectations on all levels. I highly recommend adding vegetables to the curry since it balances the heaviness out. The chicken was the perfect balance of crunchy and moist. But the main star of the dish was definitely the curry. The first time I had Japanese curry was in Vegas and I have yet to try a place that was as good until I had Curry-Ya. Warning: there aren't many seats available, so big parties are a no no! Hands down one of my favorite restaurants I had during my New York trip!!
Monica H.}New York, NY}441}59}1}-1}5}9/12/2016}A perfectly cozy little curry shop. Tasty and fast.
Cheryl W.}Long Island City, NY}64}28}39}-1}4}9/8/2016}I came here with a friend for the first time yesterday and I love it here.  It's a good spot to hang out and have tasty cheap food.  They offer a variety of different curry dishes that can be customized by spice level (mild/medium/hot).  I love spicy food! We ordered the Japanese Classic and Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry and requested for the spice level to be hot.  The curry used for the dishes were quite flavorful and the spiciness wasn't your usual kind, where it leaves a burning feeling in your mouth and you can't taste the food.  It just had a bit of a kick to it.  Both were excellent choices.  The Japanese Classic included beef, potato, carrot, pumpkin, and steamed rice that's topped with curry.   The Berkshire Pork Katsu is a deep-fried pork cutlet that comes with steamed rice and is topped with curry.For all of this and a total of 4 drinks, we each only had to pay $33, which includes tip.
JJ T.}Henderson, NV}12}7}0}-1}4}9/5/2016}The Berkshire pork katsu curry is outstanding. Highly recommend getting the dish "baked" with an egg on top. The restaurant itself is cozy. About a dozen folks line up elbow to elbow on stools at the counter. It's a difficult spot for groups of more than 2 people - it's hard to get multiple seats together, and even when you do, it's difficult to converse when sitting in a line. But don't come for the ambiance. Come because it may just be the best Japanese curry you'll find in the East Village.
Jojo G.}New York, NY}180}219}40}-1}4}8/28/2016}Japanese curry can never go wrong. I mean it is always yummi and filling. Only tired the dry curry though and it is good. My friend got baked curry. I would try the traditional one next time and compare with the one I had in Japan
Mei Mei L.}New York, NY}129}27}9}-1}4}8/24/2016}Curry-Ya serves up a traditional Japanese curry. The smells and flavors were all what I was expecting. I had the Traditional curry dish with beef and vegetables and everything tasted good (although the beef could have been a bit more tender)! I also loved the pickled onions and radishes(?)! A nice way to balance out the dish!This place is pretty small, which is why it seems like a lot of people just get take-out. ***Cash Only*** There is a Chase ATM right around the corner.
William T.}Fresh Meadows, NY}87}1}2}-1}5}8/22/2016}Delicious curry delivered in timely manner. Fresh off the grill taste and wonderful presentation.
Vaughn K.}Somerset, NJ}59}49}0}-1}4}8/19/2016}Pretty decently fried katsu, and the curry is amazing.  I'm pretty sure that you're not supposed to just eat it by the spoonful...but you will.  It's that good.  In any case, we swung by during our lunch break.  There's limited seating for patrons and if you're into that whole cozying up next to your fellow curry aficionados, you'll love it.
Victori L.}New York, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}8/5/2016}This is my go to Japanese curry place in the City (maybe I'm a bit biased since it's the only one I've been to so far: but once you find a good place you stick with it) This place is super small, but clean. They have hooks on the wall and little spaces underneath the stool for you to place your bag. Anytime I've gone I've always gone right when it opens to ensure I get a seat. The food is yummy (I really like their hamburger!). Anyone I've gone with has always enjoyed their food, but I have to admit this is pretty pricey for curry. But it's still my go to curry spot in NYC. Plus they have a bidet! What a surprise (when you think that door at the back is a closet, but turns out to a very nice bathroom)
Sarah H.}New York, NY}18}233}3}18}5}7/22/2016}I've never dined-in, but my takeout experience was great. The food arrived in about 40 minutes and it was delicious. Berkshire pork katsu curry is the best, and they give you just the right ratio of curry to rice. I tried the chicken katsu curry and honestly I don't think it's as good. Get the berkshire pork katsu curry and you cannot go wrong. I was not a fan of the lychee lassi though. Also, you can pay with credit card if you order online through grub hub, otherwise cash only for dine in and delivery!
Priscilla C.}Sacramento, CA}169}302}1553}18}5}7/18/2016}Been meaning to try this place since I've passed by a thousand times. It was actually way better than I had expected, which is why I'm giving this place a 5 star for the dish I ordered. We ordered a chicken katsu baked signature casserole and the pork katsu baked signature casserole. Pork katsu alone is $16 and chicken katsu was $14, but to make it the signature style baked casserole, an extra $5 is added on. It's a rice casserole, mixed with cheese with a sunny side up egg on top. Although the pork katsu is the most popular the chicken katsu tasted much more better and tender. The pork was okay, but a little more tougher than the chicken so I suggest ordering the chicken katsu instead. The casserole was so cheesy, it was so good. Melted in my mouth. The flavor of the curry mixed with the cheese and egg was incredible. I'm not a rice nor curry person, but everything combined in this casserole was perfect. It takes about 15-20 mins to prepare to bake, but we'll worth the wait. The lunch special also comes with a free house salad and the dressing was really good on it. We also ordered the other lassi, but I thought it was only okay. Too thick and "yogurty" for me. The table had some dried onion flakes that also went really well with the rice. Definitely will be coming back here! This place is only countertop seatings and takes cash only. The owner has multiple restaurants next door and around this area. Will include which other restaurants he owns in pix posted. He was named "restaurant king." Just a little background.
Suhwa O.}New York, NY}2}3}2}-1}1}7/16/2016}I've been currya's fan since the first time they opened. But i went to there recently the taste been changed!!!!! They were used to serve pretty fresh vegetables & beef. But they changed ingredients!! I wont go again ever!! Taste is shit and the price us changed!!
Mary F.}Brooklyn, NY}104}452}935}-1}4}7/13/2016Updatedreview}Please be warned that it is cash only and seats are limited. Picture a bar seating area and that's literally about it (probably 10 seats total). Regardless, this place is awesome. I might be bias because I was starving after bar hopping but my friend said it was good too and she can be trusted. I ordered the baked curry with their pork katsu. Cautious- let it cool a bit. With the baked curry, yes, it takes a bit longer than the other items from the menu but it is well worth it. You get a baked egg, curry of your choice, rice, and finished off with melty goodness cheese. I'm not sure what is the star of the show. The pork cutlet or the curry. They work wonders together. Get this dish. My friend ordered hamburger steak curry which wasn't as good so order the baked curry! I'll be back.
Dani S.}Brooklyn, NY}0}17}11}-1}5}7/13/2016}When I think of curry, I think Japan. And I love anime, so getting my hand on some curry was a dream come true. Of course, the quality of the curry had me concerned. I mean, who want to eat something that doesn't taste good? No matter how many times I come here, the food in this place has never disappointed me. It is very good and very filing. And the food is always set up so prettily (hope that's a word) that it's impossible not to take a picture before you eat.The service was good, the lady was nice and came to ask if we were okay a couple of times. Keep in mind it's very small. There are maybe less then 15 seats or so and it get crowded easily. They have small flower arrangements on the tables which are so cute and look lovely. There's always soft music on the background which is nice. Another highlight besides the food: the bathroom. If you know about japanese bathrooms, check it out. If you don't, just check it out.
Aoshi L.}Jersey City, NJ}4}126}0}-1}3}7/12/2016}First, highlights. Wonderful fried pork!! Seriously, the best fried pork I have ever had, way better than ootoya, (Another much more expensive, fairly famous Japanese restaurant). It's hard to imagine that someone can cook the fried pork so well that the juice is perfectly locked inside with crispy skin and golden-good looking appearance.But, that's it. The curry is a little sour. And although the fried pork is pretty good. It's not worth going there twice.
Kay W.}New York, NY}78}188}610}18}4}7/10/2016}Good Japanese curry place! We didn't get baked ones because it has melting cheese, which is too heavy for us. I got the vegetable with eggs, my friend got seafood with pork. It's the right amount of portion. We are full, but not too heavy. It's so hard to find real and not so heavy Asian curry places in the states. The only downside is cash only.
Serina L.}Philadelphia, PA}48}4}4}-1}5}7/5/2016}This place is the best curry place I've been to. I've worked in a curry restaurant in China, and it was a classic curry place, not even better than this one. I'm very lucky I can find a place like this in New York City.
Christopher C.}Hong Kong}69}106}446}-1}4}6/25/2016}Curry is delicious, and staff is friendly. I would stick with the traditional Katsu pork. I thought the seafood curry was good but flavors don't seem to seep into seafood as much as pork or chicken do.  I think it's probably due to the texture.  Otherwise the curry sauce is great, not to mention the great quality of their rice.They have about 17 seats, most of which are at the bar where all the food is prepared in front of you. There are two more intimate seats next to the bar facing the window (it's also a high stool). Note that this place is cash only, and a bit on the pricey end. We only had $25 but were only able to get a seafood curry dish and a side of pork.
Nick H.}Manhattan, New York, NY}308}289}529}18}4}6/21/2016}Possibly the best japanese curry I've ever had. You can tell in the taste that this is not instant roux block.The curry has real depth and sweetness. You can taste the spices, the vegetables that have melted into the sauce, and the base of rich meat and bones.The pork cutlet was drier than I expected. It wasn't particularly juicy, nor did I find the flavor to be significantly different from just run of the mill super market pork. The beef burger feels more like a meatloaf and is a bit crumbly and sweet.The rice seems to be of very high quality and I appreciate the presentation with teh rice mold and all.Overall, a fairly high class japanese curry experience. The curry sauce is worth it, the protein toppings are okay, but not all that impressive.
Victor H.}Suffolk, MA}9}6}1}-1}5}6/18/2016}This is a splendid little hole in the wall. Absolutely delicious, everyone was polite, great experience, great view of the actionI had the chicken cutlet curry BAKED. definitely try the baked. the little chicken cutlet nuggets were by far some of the most amazing things that have gone through a deep-fryer, oven, and mouth... and the sizzling melted cheese made me completely forget about the 80 degree steamy trash-smelling weather outside.Also, if you get some of the other curries you get 3 green beans. precisely 3. evenly cut, ±1.5cm
Andy H.}San Francisco, CA}175}311}1041}18}4}6/14/2016}there was no wait on sunday around 6pm. the service was fast and attentive in this extremely small restaurant. they only had a few options (all curry) and everything looked pretty good on the menu. i really wanted to try the bake curry, but chickened out at the last minute. i just got the classic curry with a croquette.a bit pricey for curry!! it came out to about 20 dollars a dish. the curry was flavorful, definitely tasted that msg hours later when burping.
Hin-Chung L.}Jersey City, NJ}0}4}0}-1}1}6/12/2016}I like most of japanese food just not curry. This place serves fancy japanese curry but really it tastes the same as cube curry bought from japanese grocery. I ordered the pork cutlet curry and the best part was the pork cutlet and not the curry. In this case the pork was deliciously placed on top of fast food curry. Price is high: around $16 for a plate of curry. If you want to try fast food curry then try gogo curry. If you want real fancy curry then go to an Indian restaurant.
Concetta M.}Chelsea, Manhattan, NY}263}105}63}-1}4}6/5/2016}Be sure to ask for pickles (Called Fukujinzuke) at no extra charge, as they do not automatically add them but it is a go to in traditional Japanese curry! Makes all the difference difference.Delicious! Curry is very causal Japanese dining. Bring the price down and I'll give it five stars. Until then, Curry-Ya is the real thing. A much better representation of Japanese curry then a curry chain trending in NYC (see my review on Go-go curry)
Louise S.}Manhattan, NY}0}26}3}-1}4}6/2/2016}Good food at reasonable prices. I love the fried chicken katsu there and will definitely be back for more.
Eileen R.}Queens, NY}123}71}127}18}5}5/28/2016}I came here for lunch with my friends and I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is pretty small but the service was really great.  The food came after about 10 minutes after I ordered which is really fast.  I ordered the chicken katsu curry and the chicken was crunchy and the curry was not too salty compared to the other Japanese curry places that I've been to before.  I recommend the chicken katsu curry and the classic Japanese curry.
Andrew C.}Manhattan, NY}168}29}0}-1}3}5/25/2016}I had the chicken katsu curry. The food was perfectly average but probably 3 or 4 dollars overpriced. I won't be coming back.  FINAL RATING:2.75
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}4}5/4/2016}I can cook curry myself, so I'm really asking for a lot when judging curry dishes. And since I've tried Go go curry, I tended to compare the two.Curry-ya offers more selections, and more topping choices. Cheese lovers should go ahead and order their house-specialty baked curry. It is also served cleaner, with Japanese pickles on the side. However, for a single curry dish (including topping), ~20 dollars pre-tax was definitely a bit pricey.Suggestions: skip the regular curry and opt for something unique (like beef cutlet, baked curry, or veggie). Place was extremely small and cash only.
Annabelle M.}Manhattan, NY}26}143}119}-1}3}5/4/2016}I guess I should start with an understanding that this is New York, where anything can be 2x, 3x the price elsewhere. However, $46 for two curry dishes is almost 5x the price you would get for an authentic experience in Japan. The base of a dish is reasonably priced, at $9-14, but the add-ons really get you, with as much as $3.50 per item. The curry itself was standard, didn't taste exceptionally bad or good, but they forgot to give me a spoon initially to drip the curry over the rice (they come out separately).At one point I saw them microwaving what looked like a large chunk of rice...wrapped in Saran plastic. That can't be safe to eat at all; it was quite shocking.
Joann R.}Poway, CA}142}52}195}-1}4}5/3/2016}I was in New York for a week and stayed across the street from this place. This place is great especially when it's cold and rainy out. I honestly wasn't "wow-Ed" by the favor of the food, but I did give four stars because they do put a lot of intention in ambiance, cleanliness, and presentation. Also, it might've just been my fault since I got the Veggie Curry Bowl. I shoulda went for something with meat (possibly more flavor) .
Ario K.}Los Angeles, CA}113}14}7}-1}5}4/21/2016}I like there dry curry and classic, very tranditional japan style!
Shar H.}New York, NY}43}115}9}-1}4}4/3/2016}Tonight I did takeout from Curry-Ya.  I ordered their vegetarian curry.  The curry itself is very tasty -- you can taste the complexity of the flavoring.  My only qualm is that I ordered the mild curry and it had a slight kick to it.  (Perhaps they were mistaken and gave me the medium curry instead.  Note that they have a spicy option for the curry on the menu as well.)The vegetables in the curry weren't just the traditional carrot and potato.  There was also chunks of kambocha squash, some green beans, onion and shimeji mushrooms.  For $12, I found the serving size to be a little small.  But that complaint only comes from the fact  I was left wanting more of the delicious curry!
Serena J.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}4/3/2016}Super slack off. Ordered a delivery and was late for one and half hour.
Kate V.}Los Angeles, CA}0}9}0}-1}4}3/30/2016}Tiny place good for a quick bite.Had pork katsu. Yummy. Reasonable price.Definitely give it a try!
Paige Y.}Westchester County, NY}0}107}42}-1}3}3/24/2016}My Japanese friend warned me that it was sophisticated curry.  Ok, that sounds such a contradiction.  But the Japanese succeeded to sell ramen at $14, so why not.The place was so small. Stools have no back where you can hung your coat.  There are coat hangers on the wall instead.  There is a space to shove your bag underneath the stool.  So the ambiance alone is like the regular curry shops in Japan.  Kitchen is very cream and you can watch your food being prepared.  Service was superb!Berkshire katsu curry is $16.  We have fancy curry in Japan - ones prepared by famous hotel chefs.  So curry can be fancy and sophisticated, if you really want it to be.  Being a sophisticated curry dish, the amount you get is considerably small.  At the first taste of curry, I was disappointed.  It tasted like the expensive ready made curry in the pouch.  As I ate more, I got to like it more.  The katsu was really good.I can see that they want to make this beyond the regular Japanese curry - more sophisticated as my friend put it.  $16 is a very aggressive price.  Katsu is great, and the curry is fine.  And I love rakkkyo and fukujinzuke.  But the "sophisticated" small portion and kind of gimmicky presentation would not justify the $16 price in this small counter only restaurant.  There is no privacy, no time to chat with your friends.  You eat and you leave.  That is what a small counter-only restaurants are for.  It is not a place to eat $16 meal.  And did I tell you that a can of coke was $3?  And it is cash only.Service was very friendly, and the place was very clean.  But I cannot help feeling some very confused concept in this restaurant.
Akansha B.}Manhattan, NY}198}281}153}18}4}3/11/2016}So delicious!! It's a small but efficient use of space, and I have never tried Japanese curry before (so, I'm no expert here). I ordered the chicken cutlet curry, and those chicken cutlets were perfectly cooked!! I loved the curry itself - it had complexity- it was savory but with sweet elements to it. I guess I'm just used to Indian curries, so this was a novel experience. Everything came together nicely. I think it's a bit overpriced for the offering, but the portion is good! I loved my lychee lassi and will definitely make a trip back!
Adam C.}New York, NY}332}149}40}18}4}3/9/2016}So yum! Ordered the chicken katsu with the egg and cheese. Holy smokes I hope you're hungry because this thing is so dense. Could easily share it between two people and you'd both be full. I'd recommend sharing one than getting an appetizer. Loved skimming off the cooked cheese from the sides at the end. Great dish and can't wait to try he rest! Def going to need to hit the gym tomorrow
Hsin L.}Manhattan, NY}71}65}91}-1}3}3/8/2016}I ordered baked pork katsu curry for the first time to-go . Was told $16 on the phone but when I got there it was $23(after tax). Apparently it's +5 for "baked" which doesn't make sense because it's just baked instead of ... pot-stirred? lolAsked if it came with shallots/dried garlic flakes on the side (the ones sitting on the table if you were to dine in) and it costs extra for them wth! Welp this place is good for dine in cause you get ALL the shallots and dried garlic flakes all you want for FREE. So why does it cost more for to-go? I simply don't know.Despite it all the baked pork katsu curry was delicious. They baked it in the to-go bowl. It is a small and shallow bowl but it's quite filling. Melted cheese on top was yummy but where's the egg?!I really want to like this place but the price and extra charge on condiments put me off. Rather go to GOGO Curry instead and would've gotten 2 orders of Grand Slams :(
Emily K.}Manhattan, NY}2}13}10}-1}5}3/6/2016}Best curry katsu place in nyc, period. Try their berkshire pork katsu with extra veggie topping.They only take cash.
Julian R.}New York, NY}13}22}208}-1}4}3/5/2016}Curry-Ya is always a very pleasant Japanese curry place for me. It is also very good if you want to fill up yourself. Curry not to be confused with the Indian sub-continent curries, this is not the same, for the rest of eaters, you know the Japanese culinary I am talking about.It reminds me of those minuscule Tokyo restaurants in alley streets such as Omoide, which I love. Curry -ya, even though very small, probably no more than 11 people sitting a the bar/no tables (very Japanese), is nice and clean, serving your curry in sleek fashionable plates along with silverware and tiny toy like pots.The rice is freshly steamed, sticky, yet humidly tender. This time the choices were the Vegetable Medley curry and the Dry curry (with dry fried onions and a sliced boiled egg) along with the potato croquette, crispy fried shrimp, Sapporo and Orange San Pellegrino.The curry sauce is flavor full, thick, long timed simmered to fully extract the essence. You can order how spicy you want yours prepared. Hint!, the spiciest one is very mild. This guys are experts when it comes to frying, the potato croquette and the shrimp are crispy to perfection without a drop of oil dripping. Easy to forget what you are eating has been fried. This is just crisp and made right in front of your eyes...literally like 3 feet in front of your bar seat. In other occasions I have had the tonkatsu (breaded pork) or the chicken katsu, and its the same sensation to your palate.The ambiance is of nicely loud, conversational murmurs side-to-side, the kitchen is sleek, the presentation is fashionable, the servers/cooks/cashiers are friendly, smile genuinely happy people. The Mexican cooks/servers welcome you by saying 'Irasshaimase' and the Japanese cooks/servers/cashiers are not shy to reply and farewell with an 'Adios' to a satisfied NYer leaving full and happy. Love. Up in the air. #japaneastvillage #NYCmeltingpot #iluvfood
Art C.}New York, NY}156}920}43}18}3}3/4/2016}A bit of a let down if I'm being honest. The curry wasn't bad or anything. But it wasn't special at all. We could make maybe slightly better Japanese curry from the box you get at the local Japanese market. Of the dishes we had the baked one was definitely the best. But can't say we'd ever go back here...
Nishant J.}Hoboken, NJ}262}4}0}-1}4}2/28/2016}Ambience: It's a small restaurant that probably doesn't take reservations. 10-15 seats, bar-style.Service: Baked curry dishes take slightly longer but the overall wait was quick. Cash only.Food: I ordered the baked curry with Berkshire pork katsu (medium spicy)- probably their most popular item. I thoroughly enjoyed it- good balance of curry, rice, deep-fried pork cutlets, egg, and melted cheese. You can order any type of curry with additional toppings and get it baked if you'd like. Proportion was fairly big and you have the option of mild, medium, or hot spicy. They have a small selection of beer, sake, and wine as well.
Agustinus H.}Middle Village, NY}61}23}53}-1}5}2/24/2016}This place is more on the expensive side for a curry place, but their simplicity and tastefull japanese curry makes it worth trying out. Its a small and very clean place  and good for a quick dine in.
Jenny K.}Manhattan, NY}0}98}57}-1}5}2/23/2016}The curry is delicious! Definitely get the baked curry. Portion size is pretty good too. I would definitely go back!
Karen N.}Woodside, NY}50}48}145}-1}4}2/22/2016}This place served one of the best japanese curry dishes in town! Their curry is flavorful and it is exactly what japanese curry should taste! Also, baked cheese option is a plus!! It was so gooood. However, the portion is too small and it is on pricey side. Compare to other places, their portion is half of the other places's portion. I wish they gave me more pieces of porks/seafood and more rice.
Jen S.}Brooklyn, NY}139}35}8}-1}2}2/18/2016}Extremely overpriced, mediocre curry. Ordered the pork katsu curry. The curry was bland and the portion was small for the price. The pork was also bland. Unsure why this place has such high stars.
Jera Z.}Manhattan, NY}8}30}71}-1}5}2/15/2016}Great food in a tiny place. We went there in the afternoon and not crowded. They cook in front of you and feel free to ask questions. Great curry with lots of flavor. Though it can only hold less than twenty people, definitely a wonderful curry experience.
Fatima K.}Queens, NY}178}80}86}-1}5}2/15/2016}Curry actually happens to be my boyfriend's favorite food group, so this place ended up being our Valentine's dinner venue. So happy we decided to come here because it was perfect - the food was all sorts of yum! We got the dry curry, which shifted gears from Japanese curry towards a more Indian style. It comes with ground beef and is topped with a hard boiled egg and fried onions. Each bite was extremely flavorful - I would definitely get this again! Along with the dry curry, we got the baked chicken katsu curry. This dish was highly recommended on Yelp and it did not disappoint! You can't go wrong with curry, tons of melted cheese, egg, rice, and meat all baked together to piping hot perfection! Be careful not to burn your tongue - it is REALLY hot! Not to forget, we tried the lychee lassi and it is really good! It's thick, yogurty, and has a nice lychee taste that is not too overpowering. Service is sweet and simple. Wish I lived in this building, on top of this restaurant to be exact because I could eat here every single day. This is truly comfort food at its finest in a small yet intimate space. Also, they have one of those Japanese toto toilets! You shall leave here with a happy tummy and a clean butt.
Joyce M.}New York, NY}0}10}7}-1}4}1/18/2016}Yummy curry with pickled vegetables, bonito flakes, and rice!! The service is top notch. There are several places to keep your belongings and coat. The technologically advanced bathroom is refreshing, but there's only one. It's cash only and really popular, so get there quickly!!
Kangqiao L.}New York, NY}396}26}176}-1}5}1/12/2016}Get the baked curry. Try the lassi. I find myself returning to satisfy cravings and whenever I want a quality meal.I'm very partial to lassi and they have what seems to be freshly made lassi. It's delicious. It's a little pricy for the quantity but the quality is worth it. This is true for the curry too. Some reviews complained that the curry isn't special. It's made with meat so sorry vegetarians :( but the baked option is what this place is amazing for. It takes a while to make since they have to heat up the cheese (don't worry it's not classic cheesy cheese flavor) on top. It's a very small, cramped place some nights packed. Seating is like at a bar and makes for an intimate date night. Get dinner here and pop by Snowdays for dessert. It's an amazing date.
Qurat K.}East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY}318}160}472}-1}5}1/10/2016}I wanted to try this place because it has a short, focused menu which indicates they know what they're good at: CURRY!Portions are smaller than other curry places but completely filling. Personally, I don't mind paying for quality over an overwatered/milked container of curry. $15 - pork cutlet curry$12 - classic beef and potato curry$3 - side salad with fresh peppers $3 - seaweed salad$3 - soda$4 - lassi$4.50 - lychee lassiCash only in store but offer delivery through services like Seamless.
Denny S.}Brooklyn, NY}213}354}1015}-1}5}1/9/2016}Despite the fact that it's super tiny, this place was surprisingly clean, well organized and most importantly serves good food.It's a Japanese curry place, so it's very much different than the curry that you would get from Indian restaurant. It's a lot milder and has total opposite of flavor profile from Indian curry. We ordered the Hayashi rice, beef sauteed with mushroom and onion and then a beef bourgignon like sauce added to it. It sounds weird, but it's so good.the berkshire pork baked curry with cheese was super amazing. The service here is super fast and friendly. Highly recommend this place..
H M.}New York, NY}3}59}4}-1}4}12/29/2015}Not much to say, solid Japanese Curry. The Hamburg is really good. I typically like more additions in the curry- vegetables, potatoes, beef, etc... however it's still very good and worth a visit.
Josh L.}Manhattan, NY}11}82}0}-1}3}12/20/2015}I like their dry curry and sea food curry. It is a small place but the waiting time has never been too long for me. My rating is a bit on the low end but 3* usually means that I will go back from time to time. It's a curry place - how different can you make a curry plate taste ?
Y H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}39}0}-1}5}12/17/2015}Baked curry.  Best thing ever.  Beware of cheese burn. The place is a hole-in-the-wall. Counter only, 12~15 people seating.Came here on a Sunday night.  Surprisingly, did not have to wait to sit down.Baked vegetable-beef curry is highly recommended.  *Cheese in ingredientThe 5 stars is solely dedicated to the baked curry.  The staff is great and they have tap beer.  One unisex bathroom in back.
R M.}Manhattan, NY}6}46}0}-1}3}12/16/2015}I was dying to try this place since I moved to the East Village.  It's ok. I have had better curry at Sapporo in Midtown. And the price is much better. I found the portions to be much smaller and didn't taste as good.
Jessie W.}New York, NY}16}25}795}-1}5}12/5/2015}This is a very small place and cash only. I am not pretty sure about the curry part, but the berkshire pork katsu is just PERFECT, which is fresh and juicy. MUST TRY. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I also like the rice. I will say it is top three in Manhattan. I ordered medium spicy which was not spicy at all. Maybe try hot next time.
Tansy W.}New York, NY}25}224}98}18}4}12/3/2015}LOVE the curry here! Skip the baked one but everything else is good. Warning--there is not much space inside for seating but definitely worth trying.
Walerz B.}Placerville, CA}28}789}221}-1}4}12/2/2015}I had the baked curry with the fried pork, and an additional hamburger patty and croquette.  I loved it.  It was warm and rich and very filling.  Almost everything tastes amazing with the addition of eggs and cheese.  I would've loved it more if the egg was less cooked (not hardboiled), and my curry cost $28 after tax and tip and the additional meat and croquette.  C'mon.
Steve B.}Brooklyn, NY}66}201}0}-1}5}11/30/2015}Had the plain curry over rice which is literally just the curry sauce over rice. There were some little minced in onions though and maybe some other veggies? Regardless it was delicious- and slightly sweet. And they threw in some pickles on the side. I'd come back!
Rirry C.}New York, NY}31}158}324}-1}4}11/10/2015Updatedreview}Tried the original curry with pork katsu, came with a giant gravy boat of delicious curry. Crazy delicious but the dry curry is def still my fav
Mel L.}New York, NY}1}36}26}-1}3}11/5/2015}Ate dinner at this place a few weeks ago. We ordered chicken cutlet curry and pork cutlet curry. The food was ok but a little pricey. The place is too small.
M. M.}Manhattan, NY}48}21}1}-1}5}11/3/2015}Authentic Japanese curry! So GOOD!! The baked curry is unreal!!!
Vivian Y.}Brooklyn, NY}42}124}125}18}5}10/24/2015}I can't believe it took me this long to try Curry-Ya. I guess it was because I wasn't a big fan of curry ... but Curry-Ya has changed me. I came here a couple of weeks ago, and since then I've been craving for curry! I've tried two other katsu curry from other restaurants and they cannot compare to Curry-Ya. I can't stop thinking about their baked curry!!! I am literally salivating as I am thinking about it while writing this review.The baked curry is a bit of a wait and $4.50 extra, but to me, it is so worth it! It is the curry of your choice topped with a layer of cheese and an egg, baked to perfection. It comes to you pipping hot so be warned, you may burn your tongue. Even though the curry was rich, the addition of the egg and cheese worked really well with it. This really reminds me of my childhood fave, HK style baked rice. If you like that, then I'm sure you'd like this as well.
Jon L.}Manhattan, NY}189}111}0}-1}5}10/19/2015}Fantastic Japanese Curry Spot!This is my favorite curry joint in NYC.  It is better than Go-go, Katsuhama and all of the Japanese izakaya places with curry katsu on their menu.  I recommend going for the pork tenderloin katsu curry.  The katsu is fried to golden perfection and the meat is juicy and tender.  It is served with rice and a gravy boat of curry (mild, medium, or hot).  The curry is smooth with a hint of sweetness.  My minor complaint is that the curry is a bit on the expensive side.  It was $15 for the Katsu curry.  Despite the price, the quality is top notch and with the temperatures starting dip, I will be sure to make make a monthly trip to Curry ya.
Tick...tick...tock...Clock C.}Santa Monica, CA}10}511}42}-1}5}10/17/2015}So delicious-the wait is a bit but not horrible and the kitchen is very efficient -if you are going to eat in there is a woman who takes your order while you are waiting so you can munch as soon as possible-baked curry bowl is the best! It is like Asian fusion comfort in a hot pot bowl... It does take 15-20 minutes. The service is very friendly the space is tight but when your eating some delicious food you kind of forget about it all... They don't take credit cards but lucky for everyone there is a bank around the corner.  Come on by to have what feels like a hug in a bowl :)
Victoria R.}Manhattan, NY}7}30}12}-1}5}10/16/2015}Solid curry, the sauce is rich, complex, and satisfying. Points for atmosphere, I love the marble top bar and the airiness of the place itself, even though it's only a bar it doesn't feel cramped. If you're really hungry and looking for something super hearty o recommend getting your curry baked.
Raul V.}Brooklyn, NY}6}23}1}-1}5}10/7/2015}Been venturing around the city for curry that I personally think is good and out of the five places that I've been to that are recommended online and by friends. I enjoy this place the most! The food is awesome, as well as the service and ambiance of the place. You can't go wrong with anything thats on the menu.
Gina C.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}98}113}340}18}5}10/3/2015}I love this place. Was so happy my NY friends introduced it to me back when I visited in January that I made it a must for this visit. It is a tiny restaurant, cute and cozy. The seating is pretty much just the bar seating and behind the bar is basically their kitchen.. where the all the magic happens. I  was so amazed analyzing what they were able fit in such a small space. You get to see everything made in front of you. I had the Berkshire Pork both times. It is so good. The Katsu batter is perfect, not too thick and the Japanese curry that is served on the side to pour over it is amazing! The service is great and I enjoy the experience of watching my food being prepared in front of me. Not for big groups. We got really lucky getting a party of four in for lunch.
Catherine C.}Flatiron, Manhattan, NY}355}64}97}-1}4}10/1/2015}I had the baked Berkshire katshu curry. It was very good and filling. The rice was topped with katshu pork, cheese and a half cooked egg. The meal was very tasty but it was quite pricy. I spent $24.
Victor C.}Philadelphia, PA}439}161}19}-1}2}9/28/2015}Ever try the boxed Japanese curry they sell at the supermarket? Well, you're better off eating that stuff than paying $15+ (tip) at Curry-Ya. The location is a cool little place near St. Marks. We had high hopes going in. But after the first few bites, my girlfriend and I decided to just finish off the meat and leave. The curry is thick, which is how it's supposed to be. That's how they deceive you; the flavor is very watered down. Both of us agreed that the curry must have been diluted and then mixed with corn starch or some type of thickener to re-create the curry consistency. Unsatisfied and feeling ripped-off, we left to our next food stop. The new frites place around the corner, which is another sad review.
Jenn C.}Manhattan, NY}419}185}322}18}3}9/24/2015}Curry is probably in my top 5 favorite foods. Japanese curry has a sweeter taste than other curries. I really like the baked classic curry. They layer rice, curry and an egg and cheese on top. Ingenious. Kinda pricey though...you can make this at home for so much cheaper.
Yutong G.}Manhattan, NY}97}1}0}-1}3}9/23/2015}Food alright but overpriced. The rice was a little too dry; sauce was nice (I got hayashi rice) but certainly NOT worth 13 bucks.
Allyson A.}Los Angeles, CA}22}56}314}-1}2}9/14/2015}This place was just okay. I had the baked curry and my proteins was over cooked. My pork katsu was super hard to cut into; even the egg was a bit rubbery! Definitely not worthy the extra $4.50 to have cheese and over cooked proteins with my curry. Disliked the fact that the people around my group that came after was served their meals first. Also, seating is very limited and its CASH ONLY.
Stephen K.}Manhattan, NY}94}77}7}-1}5}9/13/2015}I thought I knew good curry as I'm intimately familiar with the terrible-yet-actually-amazing gogocurry. However, I was naive. If gogocurry is the cheap but perfect for what it costs and what you sign up for, this place is the actual restaurant equivalent.  The food is outstanding.  The rakkyo always crunchy and refreshing.  I tried the regular katsu curry, the baked curry. Both were mind-blowing and perfect versions of this under-appreciated food. My friend, who had to dry curry, liked it so much he wouldn't even let us try, if thats at all a testament to the food here.The seating is limited, it's basically just a bar, and this place is not good for groups. But it's modestly priced for an actual meal in this area and you won't be disappointed.
Jun T.}Washington, DC}1}22}11}-1}4}9/11/2015}Love their baked curry!! hayashi rice is just alight. Would come here again for baked curry :D Friendly staffs.
Ken L.}New York, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}9/10/2015}Katsu-Ha... what?A cozy little curry house that serves up a cleaner and not-too-fatty Berkshire pork katsu with Japanese style curry that actually tastes better than those curry cubes that is in every lazy Asian mother's arsenal. Try their dry curry if you're in the mood for something a little different. Cash only.
Stephanie S.}Washington, DC}147}145}53}18}4}9/7/2015}More of 3 1/2 stars. Friendly staff and solid Japanese curry. But I would say the food is a bit more expensive for its portion. My husband ordered Berkshire pork cutlet curry, which was actually a lot sweeter than  what we expected. He isn't really into food that is sweet, so he actually did not enjoy his curry as much. My dry curry, on the other hand, was really good. We definitely want to come back and try the baked versions when we visit New York again.
Jess C.}FLUSHING, NY}139}98}155}-1}4}9/7/2015}Curry-ya offers solid delicious curry that is both filling and heart warming. I could see myself definitely coming back more often in the winterFood - 4/5 Value - 4/5 (Big plate of curry with plenty of rice!)Space - 3/5 (counter seats only with high chairs around the center in a U shape)Ambience - 4/5 (Bright and clean)Decor - 4/5 (Simplistic and fun as you can see what the "chefs" are doing)I had the dry-curry + fried oyster (and also sampled the baked Japanese curry from my friend)The dry-curry is, as its name has it, drier and it's not very saucy. Topped with slices of hard boiled egg, which to my surprise, goes very well with curry. I had my share of indian cuisine and not once I remember having hard boil eggs with the curry. I must say though that the curry moisten the dry egg yolk nicely and as they come together they become this wonderful delicious "eggoo". I personally like the dry-curry more than the Japanese curry / baked curry (with mozzarella cheese and egg) because with the Japanese curry I feel like the sauce is drowning the rice and all I could taste is the curry and it can get too salty. As for the dry curry, the flavor is more intense and spicier, I like my rice complementing the taste of curry but still having its own individual body (if that makes sense) I am able to taste both at the same time in my mouth, whereas the Japanese curry is overpowering in an aggressive way. I also don't think mozzarella goes well with runny/sweet Japanese curry. The combination did not work for me. I ordered a fried oyster add-on ($2.5 for one), it was not bad but I feel it was also unnecessary and it did not add to the curry. I would go without it next time and try something else! In front of you is a small container with picked onion and ginger similar to the pickled ginger at sushi place, this will give a special little zing with your curry on the side.Overall, I highly recommend curry-ya and their dry-curry. (I wish I work closer to St. Mark's so I can come for the lunch special!) I look forward to come back to this cute little store and try the haiyashi rice next time. I see no reason why anyone would not like curry-ya, it has good curry, clean and bright, and the staffs are friendly. Next door is Hi-Collar, you can just pop one store over for a drink with friend or date after a nice spicy meal!
Peter L.}Bloomington, IN}0}15}1}-1}5}9/6/2015}We arrived there between the lunch time and dinner time. I would say I won't make curry by myself for a while after I tasted their curry. It is so delicious, both pork katsu and curry, even their rice. Next time when I back to NYC, I will definitely come back.
K N.}Washington, DC}2}9}5}-1}5}9/3/2015}Went on a Friday around 6pm and luckily got 2 spots! I ordered Chicken katsu curry and it was the best curry I have ever tried in my life!!!! I will definitely go back there!!!! Not bad on pricing and the order came out fast! I loved everything! But beware it's a tiny tiny place so it's only good for 2 and max 3. You also have options to add toppings!
Kaya V.}Brooklyn, NY}1}5}6}-1}5}8/25/2015}Its such a cute small place sandwiched between two other restaurants. The owner was SUPER NICE. The food was absolutely perfect to me! You pour the curry on your rice and everything yourself by the way. Main dishes come with a salad.
Stevie V.}Lutherville-Timonium, MD}0}9}6}-1}5}8/16/2015}Before heading out of NY, my wife and i wanted to have our lunch in East Village. There was an eye catching ramen joint next doors but we passed because we have a good ramen fix at our regular location near home. After searching on yelp, we found this place and couldn't really understand how japanese food and curry could go together. Although we are asian, it was still mysterious to us.We went in as they opened and there was already a small line, so we knew we were in for a treat. My wife ordered their Dry Curry and i got the Pork Katsu curry. Both meals come with rice and complimentary salad. To be 100% honest, the food was good... Just good... Nothing more nothing less. Ive had other interesting japanese food but it was more of a easy to like dish.I give them 5 stars because of their authenticity and excellent service. Real nice Japanese employees who will want to make you revisit.Overall, i would recommend to give it a try!
Dan K.}New York, NY}220}359}24}18}3}7/31/2015}YA Curry! It was fresh and clean but overall the joint didn't wow me. The curry here is much more traditional hi-rice style curry than the ones at other Katsu-curry places like gogo or dem uptown joints. The Katsu is very lightly breaded and the meat was pretty good. I also had the meat patty which tasted great but wasn't super new. The amount of food is about right and the cost isn't overwhelming, but you kinda leaving wanting a bit more, especially on the meat servings. The place is really squished and small with counter style seating. I'd say this is more of a solo joint. Probably won't be back but still good to try at least once!
April L.}Rockville, MD}0}27}0}-1}3}7/30/2015}Staff was sweet and that's always a plus. I had the baked curry while my friend had the pork katsu curry. I don't have curry very often around the city so out of all my experiences, this one was decent. Although in my time around other cities in the US, I have had much more flavorful curry. The pork katsu was also mildy soggy rather than crispy which gave it a lack of taste as well. For its price, I don't think I would revisit too often. But if I'm ever back in the city having a major curry craving, I'd consider coming again.
Riri C.}Manhattan, NY}0}69}0}-1}5}7/28/2015}I have vivid dreams about this place. Vivid, curry filled dreams. Their baked curry is to die for, and the service is impeccable. Your order comes quickly, drinks are refilled instantaneously and ambiance is nice and cozy. I look forward to coming back here.
Jm H.}Jersey City, NJ}46}62}8}-1}5}7/25/2015}Cash only, there's a chase atm on the corner. Cute tea and drinks place next door. Curry is good and comes mild medium or spicy. Staff is pleasant. AC works well but bathroom was broken. :(Had lunch here today but have been here before with hubs. It's a small casual place we both enjoy.
Luna A.}Manhattan, NY}54}56}10}-1}1}7/9/2015}Meh. They just melt processed curry bars into the jar and serve. No carrots, potatoes or any kinds of vegetables were inside the plain curry pastes, the size of chicken katsu was small as a baby's palm, and no pickles except four tiny pieces of cut string bean-ish object. My friend and I completely wasted our precious hard earned money here at this place in fifteen minutes. Guess what? I am still hungry. The hamburger steak was as small as a bird's poop.... I was supposed to stay at home and melt the Japanese curry bars I have at home into the pot... Why have I wasted money in this way.... Questioning myself, this place is not worth the price at all. Music was off and there was an awkward silence in the restaurant for a while until new two victims came in... Where is the service? Well... I am gonna make some snack at home to feed hungry me.
Pawan H.}Saint Louis Park, MN}0}12}0}-1}5}7/8/2015}Excellent but simple curry and chicken katsu, would highly recommend.
Kiyo O.}Los Angeles, CA}58}137}48}-1}4}7/4/2015}tiny little curry shop in the east village. when I'm in the mood for curry this place definitely hits the spot. staff is also very nice.
Ferdinand C.}Bronx, NY}46}192}4}18}5}7/2/2015}Went on a Thursday night around 630 PM and there was no wait. We started with the buckwheat beer which was refreshing and went well with the curry dishes we ordered. We tried the yuba salad. It tasted good in that it was different. We'll worth the try. For the curries we had the baked Berkshire pork and seafood curry. The baked curry with cheese on top was AMAZING. The downside is though if you like crunchy katsu, this dish wouldn't do for you. The seadfood curry was ok. I also ordered it with a hamburger steak which just normal tasting. Overall it was a great experience. Would go again. Cash only.
T U.}Alexandria, VA}1}28}24}-1}5}7/2/2015}I am in love with this place at the first visit.  I was visiting NYC and a friend recommend me this place for good curry.  Service was alright nothing special,  we got seated immediately so that was good (but it was past lunch time anyways). Everything in the menu sounded delicious but settled on something simple and ordered the baked classic Japanese curry. They gave us a mini salad while we waited.  Then it came. I was pretty much staring at this glorious bubbling hot curry with egg and baked cheese on top while making weird squealing noises of delight and weirding out anyone in my vicinity. The combination of kabocha and the beef was unexpected but amazing. Melted cheese and egg....Is there anything else to say?I am coming back here no questions asked.
Tammy W.}Brooklyn, NY}124}412}163}18}4}6/29/2015}CASH ONLY!I love the feel of this place.  It's small but cozy.  I tried the chicken katsu medium.  The crisp on the chicken is perfect.  I think I would have liked hot better.  The spiciness of the curry is not "normal"?  It's not spicy is what I'm trying to say.  It has a slight kick but not really.  My bf also tried the mini steak for $4 and he really liked that.What I liked most about the place was the toilet.  Japanese restaurant, gotta have a japanese toilet!  It was the first time seeing one so it was cool.  I didn't play with all the options but it's cool!
Ellie H.}Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA}10}61}162}-1}5}6/27/2015}I like it! I ordered the veggie Madley curry with crispy fried shrimp. I was impressed by the taste of curry, which was creamy and also tasted fruity. The shrimp was also really crispy. Like it!
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}5}6/2/2015}Well to be honest. I always declined coming to this place. Simply because I didn't think I would like it, and the idea of having kare was kind of a turnoff for me.After declining karee for more than three months, I finally gave in.I ordered seafood kare with a side of natto and vegetables with brown rice.Uhmmm.... HOLY SHIT THAT WAS LEGIT. I died, I had explosions in my mind, my soul, my mouth, I just exploded. The shrimp was so good, the scallop too... Uh.. I highly recommend it.Also, the natto gave it a more incredible touch. I'm a natto fan, but I don't recommend it to anyone, ANYONE, unless you actually eat it and enjoy it, without the seasoning.ANYWAYS, My girlfriend had the chicken katsu kare and she didn't really like the katsu chicken because i was too dry. Well... Some other things: the places i really tiny, the people that work there are nice and welcoming like most Japanese places I've been, the seats are very heavy hahaha! But yeah, I love it.I can't go to GOGO Curry because I don't eat meat, but I think that I like it here more.Ps. The second time I came I had the shrimp tempure and it was pretty good. I wouldn't pay 3 dollars for one piece of shrimp again though...Ok ok! BYE!
S S.}Elmhurst, NY}1}24}1}-1}4}5/30/2015}Love coming here. The curry is so yummy and so many different choices to choose from. It's a bit small and not great for big groups but still enjoy coming here. My 14 year old niece is a big fan and has been back 3 times with me.
Sarah Y.}Austin, TX}8}2}1}-1}4}5/28/2015}This petite Japanese curry house is located in a charming area surrounded by other small restaurants. The interior is simple, clean, and has an opened seating area that makes you feel close to the cooks serving you. The lady that served me was very welcoming and cheerful. She recommended the pork katsu curry ($15), which did not disappoint. I would rate the taste between 3-4 stars as I would with the dry curry dish ($13) that I also ordered. The portions were rather small for the price range, but is definitely worth the try if you've never had Japanese curry before. The spiciest level is not hot at all, so don't be scared to ask for extra hot if that's what you're looking for. Overall I would recommend this place to a friend and come again if there were no other new places to get my j-curry fix.
Chris D.}Austin, TX}0}23}4}-1}4}5/28/2015}Around $13-16 (incl tax) for an entree. I got the dry curry and the pork katsu; the food is 3-4 star quality but the service is great. The waitress I had was very friendly and helpful. Arrived around 9pm on a Thursday and it was not too busy, no wait at all. The restaurant only seats about 12 people. Portions were decently nice, enough to fill you up.
Real M.}New York, NY}5}301}0}-1}4}5/28/2015}Cash only.I got the chicken katsu curry with a side salad (because curry plates don't give you veggies!). The curry was creamy and good. The chicken was cooked well.I had to ask for the red raddish pickle daikon stuff. So do that and enjoy.Debbie L. gave it 3 stars even though her review says 4 stars. My mind is boggled.
Diana T.}Brooklyn, NY}0}31}47}-1}4}5/27/2015}Had the classic curry which was pretty good. Had a free salad on the side too. If you like your curry spicy, this probably isn't the place for you. Their spice isn't that high. The portion wasn't as big as I would've like for the price but I can't complain.
Olena S.}Manhattan, NY}60}4}7}-1}5}5/26/2015}Great, quick, healthy meal. Was running through E. village and couldn't resist the smell of curry and hearty meal. Small place, quite and very clean! If you like spicy food -this is a must!Enjoy!!
Al L.}Toronto, Canada}980}856}970}-1}3}5/2/2015}Baked berkshire pork curry. Very good. Very tasty. But kinda pricey at $19.50. ($15 for regular + $4.50 for baked). I don't think its 2x as good as gogocurry. Tho its a fancier plate of food, but japanese curry isn't really supposed to be that fancy. Overall good experience, but don't think its worth it. Also cash only policy is dumb when they clearly do seamless. Just screams tax evasion to me...#jussayin
Debbie L.}Houston, TX}322}111}536}18}3}4/21/2015}Four stars only because it was a little pricey.I got the chicken katsu curry.I'm really picky with the way things are fried and often react with some types of the breading or oil used.Katsu was crunchy and the chicken was still tender. Curry was nothing too special but the genie bottle in came in was kinda cool. My friend got the pork katsu curry BAKED. It looked really cool but she didn't like it too much. Baking it took away the crunchiness and made into more of casserole Definitely creative but not worth the extra $4.50.Small restaurant that fits maybe 10 customers at a time. But watching the chefs do their thing is pretty cool and they looked happy to do it too even though it was really hot with all the oven heat.
Ninja M.}New York, NY}42}270}233}-1}3}4/17/2015}3.5 stars.  Service is ok.  Food is good, but expensive and small portion.   Bathroom toilet is high tech.  Had Chicken Curry which was good.   Mild spicy is still medium spicy.  Tight small restaurant.   They speak Japanese and some English.
Wei T.}New York, NY}15}84}37}-1}3}4/14/2015}Love the "cheesed up" curry, very delicious, but a bit too salty, and not suitable if you want to keep fit!
Kaitlyn Y.}New York, NY}39}296}123}-1}5}4/12/2015}random Friday night driving through the village not knowing what to eat and we tumble down this place. it looked tiny but the food smells good. no wait, so we decided to try it out. first I have to say for a small place like this they have a high tech toilet. i wish they had more seatings instead of that tiny tiny place. I feel like they would capture more customers if they have a bigger space. the curry chicken dishes were one word : delicious!!!!!!!  say no more I fish every bit of my food! Ya!!!
Alice L.}New York, NY}0}22}27}-1}2}4/5/2015}Came here because I was craving for Japanese curry. Restaurant is really tiny with stools wrapped around the bar. This place definitely does not cater to bigger groups. We are 2 people and waited for about 20-25 mins on a weeknight during dinner time. I think for the price you pay, the portions are quite small. Curry is rather on a bland side and I think I can even cook it myself at home with store bought Japanese curry cubes. To me it tasted the same. With the price I'm paying, I think I can make it at home and have a larger pot of curry that has more meat that can feed 5 people. No joke.I ordered the Chicken Katsu curry, which was ok. My fiancé ordered the Japanese Classic and it was a really sad looking curry with only tiny bits of beef pieces in the curry swimming with a few vegetable chunks. I wished I took a picture of it. And personally I don't think the baked option is worth $4 to add on to your curry.
David W.}Flushing, NY}52}73}4}-1}3}4/5/2015}It is a nice small store, and the food is good. However, i only give 3 stars because their curry sauce disappointed me. The issue of the sauce is its taste is too light, a little bit of cheddar cheese could totally cover the curry taste.
Shani T.}Boston, MA}145}225}121}18}5}3/23/2015}When I'm looking for comfort food, I come to Curry Ya. After I got my wisdom teeth removed, I ordered Curry Ya for delivery (yup, awful idea to eat rice after wisdom teeth removal, but I needed that comfort food).The place is very small, seats probably about 15 people, and oftentimes can get extremely crowded. I've had to wait awhile for a table before, but they typically move people in and out fairly quickly. I order the chicken curry, while my boyfriend always orders the chicken katsu curry. We both love our meals and these dishes have never disappointed us. We typically come here for lunch, and the curry comes with a small salad (generous slice of tomato included, which I appreciate). The curry here is amazing. Very home-y feeling, and not too spicy if you prefer it that way. The vegetables used in the curry taste extremely fresh and the presentation of the dish is very cute. A nicely shaped, rather sizable chunk of rice, and a cute little metal dish to hold the curry. Even the delivery containers are packaged very neatly.I did order the curry baked once, and found it way too cheesy. The additional cost wasn't worth it in my opinion, and the regular is really all you need for a delicious experience.
Simon W.}New York, NY}286}20}15}-1}5}3/11/2015}Great hidden treasure in the area. It has great Japanese curry chicken over rice. The price is about right, not too expensive nor too cheap. A mellow place for a quick dinner or lunch.
Calvin L.}New York, NY}258}123}64}18}5}3/11/2015}I came here a few weeks ago with my girlfriend, and the place was surprisingly empty. There wasn't a lot of seating, but we were there late on a weeknight and consequently the only one's thereThe whole preparation is done behind the counter, which I found fun to watch. The two workers made great appetizers for another couple that stumbled in after us.They pulled out fresh material and cut everything to-order, so you can see they use fresh ingredients and put a lot of care into their orders. Taste: 5/5 on my Chicken Curry. Flavorful, and the perfect amount of rice to get a great consistency. This was my first time having Japanese Curry.   My girlfriend got the baked pork curry, which was even better in my opinion--the egg and cheese were a great addition in terms of flavor. They were brought out to us still boiling, so we unfortunately had to wait for them to cool down.The food was incredible, and it was fresh-made in front of us sort of Benihana esq, if you pay attention. Make sure to bring cash, as it's cash only! Would definitely come here again.
Lils Y.}Manhattan, NY}191}231}175}-1}3}3/8/2015}Not worth the hype. Overpriced, flavor tastes just like boxed golden curry you make at home.Ordered the Pork Katsu curry and the chicken, both of which were good, but considering the portion size (pictures look larger than actual) with the heaping amount of rice vs. meat/curry, I would have much rather spent 30 minutes making this at home than waiting 30 minutes for this delivery. Perhaps it was because we couldn't order the BAKED version which sounds like the most popular dish, but prices are too steep for what you get.The BF and I both felt ripped off.
Geezy B.}New York, NY}277}225}1126}-1}5}3/3/2015}A cozy spot to eat alone and be away from people.
Alan C.}Elmhurst, NY}594}118}472}-1}3}2/28/2015}It's a cold February in New York which means 18 degrees weather outside and 10 degrees in my apartment.. It was time to seek some food to warm the body. What better cuisine than some hot curry over rice ?Curry-Ya seemed to fit the requirements for the occasion so off we went ! The restaurant is small and probably seats around 15 people. There are hangers on the wall for your jackets and a small place under the bar stool seats to put your bags, most people just sat on top of their jackets. All of the seats except for two (window seats) are at the bar, so you can see the chefs at work. I ordered the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry and the gf ordered the Seafood Curry. The curry comes in a separate serving bowl in which you can pour over your steaming rice (which I really enjoyed doing).The Katsu was good but the main attraction was the curry. The Seafood Curry comes with shrimp, scallops, squid,  carrrots and other vegetables which results in a rich flavor.We also ordered the lychee lassi which was flavorful and refreshing.Both dishes were good but really did not stand out compared to other curry locations. Portions were a bit small in my opinion. I definitely would have ordered extra rice if I didn't already have dessert planned after our meal.I would come back to Curry-Ya if I'm ever around the area to try their baked curry dishes.
Svyatoslav A.}Manhattan, NY}20}17}12}-1}5}2/26/2015}The best Japanese curry in NYC! If you've never eaten here and you are a curry fan, you should go. This place serves curry exactly the same way as I remember getting it in Japan. Even the store itself is a fully Japanese experience with bar-like seating and cramped hallway. (Beware if you are overweight, you will have trouble fitting into this place. I use that fact as a way of reminding myself to work out and diet so I can keep enjoying this delicious curry.) They even have the super-techy Japanese toilet. Revel in the multitude of buttons and functions that this technological marvel of a porcelain throne has. And then get back to munching on thick potato-ey Japanese curry with your choice of protein: chicken katsu, Japanese hamburger, croquet. For a truly authentic experience, they also serve beer and lassi.
Jane K.}Los Angeles, CA}153}91}37}-1}5}2/26/2015}Wowww!!! This place is gooooood!! ALL the curries here are delicious.I dont even like japanese curry but I LOVE it here.TIPS:1) CASH ONLY 2) If you get the curry spicy, its more of a peppery spicy taste, not a my-mouth-is-on-fire taste, which I love. 3) I recommend getting a topping with your curry if youre not getting one that already comes with it.
Natasha K.}New York, NY}13}43}15}-1}5}2/22/2015}This is the ultimate comfort food spot. The katsu curry here brings me back to my Tokyo days. Everything from the perfectly oval rice presentation to the heated Toto toilets leave me warm and happy. Even the fact that it's a tight fit (c/o the limited bar seating) feels familiar and cofortingly Japanese.To me, it's one of the best culinary escapes from NYC's hustle and bustle.
Raven K.}Whitestone, NY}18}2}0}-1}5}2/18/2015}One of the best Japanese curry restaurant I have tried in NYC. They don't have a big dish but it definitely fulfill your stomach. Their burger and pork cutlet are must try. Also the fried onion is best to mix with the curry and rice.However, that is a very small restaurant so beware if you have a big party. I love to go there by myself in the winter time.
Christina F.}New York, NY}0}5}1}-1}4}2/12/2015}Not usually a curry fan but this was delicious - so so good and so happy they deliver! Polite staff and great food.
Brian L.}Los Angeles, CA}157}139}11}-1}5}2/8/2015}Cozy spot with counter seating only. I shared a baked Berkshire pork cutlet, which was nearly enough for 2 people. Getting the curry baked for an extra 3.50 adds an egg and cheese on top, which really seals the deal on an amazing dish. Do it and don't look back!! The melted cheese, hearty egg and curry all meld together in delicious unison with the rice and meat. Definitely unique, and would hit up this spot again in a heartbeat.
Yalong C.}Chinatown, Manhattan, NY}13}6}0}-1}4}2/6/2015}I give four star because this is not the best in taste regarding to tons of Japanese restaurant in NYC but definitely the most worth-eating for daily dinning. Authentic is the best word I would use to describe it. Unlike those Indian/Thai/Malaysia curry, Japanese curry is not intensive in smell but delightful in taste. This is what this restaurant's curry hold for. The dry curry is very much Japanese Style and so does the Hayashi Rice. Cutlet with quality pork. The store is small but feels good when sitting at the counter. They offer delivery, which is a pro that should worth another star because it's delicate pack-up. Although you will need to order as soon as possible once you decided because of the somewhat limited delivery speed. Overall, a great place for economical but still tasty food. A "must" for curry fan/Japanese food fan！
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}3}2/1/2015}Overall an okay meal.  I guess if you have a specific hankering for Japanese curry this would be a decent option.  I tried the chicken curry and my husband had the pork katsu curry.  We also ordered a side of veggies for one of the curries and a side salad.  The chicken curry was okay. I probably wouldn't order it again not super flavorful and the chicken was kind of fatty. The pork cutlet was delicious and came straight out of the deep fryer onto the plate.   They basically just scoop some curry sauce out of a big pot into tiny little iron pots and toss in a few veggies here and there depending on which of the curries you order. The restaurant is stool seating crowded around a counter that faces their very narrow kitchen and you watch them make your food.  Our total was about $42 plus tip. I don't think I'll be back.Summary: If you want Japanese curry this is a decent option although nothing particularly remarkable and its slightly overpriced.
Smiley V.}Sterling Heights, MI}121}86}62}18}4}1/31/2015}I'll admit, I'm not much of a curry fan. The thought of having curry as a meal never excited me in the past. But after making this impromptu stop, I'm a changed woman! This place has got their recipe down! I went with the classic curry with a side of pork cutlet.  You can never go wrong with classic, and I was not the least bit disappointed.  My friend had the seafood curry, normally I am a huge a seafood fanatic...but it was a bit of a let down for me. So by deduction, some curry dishes here are a real hit, and others probably not as much.  But I'd be happy to return to try them all out.The atmosphere was very claustrophobic, as this place literally seats about 10 people. But the food and service was above par, so no real complaints here. 4 stars.
Wilson J.}Fresh Meadows, NY}84}2}0}-1}4}1/21/2015}Bar style Japanese curry with a very clean ambiance thing going for it. Food is fantastic and the drinks menu is small but keeps selecting a drink simplistic. Fantastic for eating alone and will definitely go again if I'm in the area
Gigi H.}San Francisco, CA}15}18}39}-1}3}1/21/2015}Loved the baked curry, extra $4 for an egg & cheese, free salad during lunch. It was delicious.Tips: store only accepts cash. $10 minimum for persons if you were to share. Unfortunately, the baked curry does not come in HOT, spice level.
Sara L.}Manhattan, NY}689}515}3128}18}4}1/17/2015}Cute, little authentic Japanese spot in the East Village perfect for your Japanese gourmet curry fix. Joined two friends, one of which loves this spot, and they recommended the Baked Curry/Japanese Classic ($11, combination of beef, potatoes, carrots, and pumpkin). Comes super piping hot and is the perfect comfort dish for a cold day. Note that it costs an additional $3.50 for the baked version.This place is no doubt tiny, but the space is clean. There is no table seating, just a bar with stools that conveniently have storage cubbies for your belongings. It was a Thursday evening, and the wait was about 30 minutes for 3 people. You cannot hold seats unless the entire party is there, or missing individuals are arriving close to seating time. We all ordered the Baked Japanese Classic Curry. It comes with an egg baked atop the layer of curry, and beneath all this goodness is the rice and vegetables. Delicious, hearty meal, and again, perfect Japanese comfort food for any cold day. The preparation reminds me a bit of pot pie. That with a Sapporo beer, it was the perfect casual dinner. Portion size was substantial for one person.Curry-ya is the go-to spot for Japanese curry. I have been to a few spots for curry, but I would say this is now one of my top recommendations for this particular type of meal. They offer a pretty decent variety regarding the Japanese curry, and I would definitely return to try more. Must note that it is cash only.
Alan H.}Manhattan, NY}209}84}119}-1}4}1/15/2015}Good Japanese curry.  Served in a small pot on the side for you to self-slather your rice and food.  Lots of options and small plates to supplementBar style seating, very compact space.  Seats about 20 people all in
Ting I.}Los Angeles, CA}29}36}5}-1}5}1/12/2015}Best Japanese curry in town! Portions are always great and the quality of the curry and service is wonderful!Highly recommend this place for taking your date here because 3 houses towards 2nd ave is 'Chikalicious' aka desert bar. Combine these two locations and you're a winner ;)
Katherine F.}Austin, TX}678}202}39}18}4}1/11/2015}I love this place! It's homey and tiny, so be prepared for a possible wait, and it's honestly pretty pricy for the amount of food you get. That being said, the porkchops are always fried to perfection; the curry is just the right heat (temp and spice); and the rice has that perfectly elusive texture of slightly-sticky-but-not-at-all-mushy.
Amy T.}Flushing, Queens, NY}131}148}396}-1}4}1/11/2015}This place was hard to find but the food here is great! Very clean, open kitchen so you basically see everything. Good curry with different combinations !!! I got the seafood curry and plum wine, portion wise, it was small!!! Lol  And the space was really small too! My friends and I don't even have space to walk or put our things ! They have small hooks under the counter for your bags and hangers on the wall for your coats.  They also do deliveries and take out so if I live close by, I rather order deliveries and just eat at home !
Kevin L.}Manhattan, NY}69}46}72}-1}4}1/10/2015}Finding good Japanese curry in the city can be a little harder than you would think. My go to favorite is Go Go curry but my friends convinced me the other night to try Curry-Ya and I wasn't disappointed!There's only counter seating so don't expect to go with a huge group. It's just about timing on when you go but the wait isn't long. I ordered the pork tankatsu curry and my friend ordered the dry curry. The curry is individually prepared in your own separate iron pot so you know it just wasn't plopped on your plate from a huge pot made for the masses. The pork was breaded nicely and fried just the right amount. The curry was made to my "medium" spicy level out of low to high and it just the right amount of heat. Curry-ya's curry is more on the sweeter side than the savory but still good. It goes well with the pickled onions and ginger on the side as well.The dry curry looked and tasted amazing as well. Just think of curry in like a chili form with less sauce topped on rice with a load of sliced hard boiled eggs. I didn't snag a pic but that's going to be my next choice next time!If you like curry and don't mind spending a little more, come here with a friend or two.Curry prices start around $11 and go up to $15+ depending if you want more add ons. CASH ONLY!!!
MichLee A.}New York, NY}9}456}2}-1}4}1/6/2015}Japanese comfort food in a cool bar setting. Definitely try the lychee lassi; it's a little random for a Japanese place but very tasty. The curries all seem to start with the same salty-sweet base. I really enjoyed the chicken katsu, but thought the Japanese traditional was a little boring (and the meat was dry). We also took a seaweed salad, which was totally worth it -- very fresh.
Daniel H.}New York, NY}1}53}13}-1}5}1/3/2015}Best Japanese curry in New York. Great food and service. Will definitely go back there next time I am in New York.
Isitfiveyet L.}Manhattan, NY}0}47}2}-1}5}12/27/2014}I saw so many appetizing photos of the baked berkshire pork cutlet and I couldnt wait to try it. I  would of tried this place earlier but I was a bit skeptical because I 'm not a huge fan of curry. This place was super cozy and has limited seating. I dont know  how they work with 5 ppl behind the counter but it works. The waitress was very nice and gave suggestions when asked. The Baked goodness was delicious and sizzling hot out the oven. Overall, I would definitely go back again to try everything else on the menu! See you soon!
Kalem C.}Hyattsville, MD}37}3}1}-1}5}12/6/2014}Oh mannnn. So I saw that place and saw they made a baked curry...I've never seen this before so I had to try. We got there and it's this cute small place. Definitely has a comforting feel to it. Fun staff. Oh fyi they have the cook Japanese toilet in the bathroom (random I know). So I ordered the chicken katsu curry baked. Amazingggg. The cheese and egg on top just adds to the already delicious flavors of the curry. I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out.
Sheryl W.}Manhattan, NY}346}137}16}-1}5}11/10/2014}The dried beef curry is my favorite. It comes with these amazing dried onion things. I eat curry ya at least 2x a week. I have every food sensitivity known to man and curry ya triggers none of them...so I can conclude they are using quality ingredients. It is cash only so be prepared for that. It's a tiny establishment so you might have to wait if you get there on a Friday or Saturday night. Everything on the menu is good...the hamburger, pork cutlet, vegetable curry, ANYTHING. I just moved down the street so the delivery option makes me very happy. The delivery guy is a sweetheart. Tip him well please. In conclusion, RUN and get curry ya. I've never introduced someone to this place and they not enjoyed it. It's a solid    "You know it's going to taste good" type of meal. Oh and they have the cool toilet with heated seats and the water spray thing for your butt :)
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}11/7/2014Updatedreview}This place has still got it.  It's on Seamless but I really recommend eating in and getting it baked with cheese. If you don't want it to be too rich, tell them to go easy on the cheese. Note that they cut off baked requests near closing time. My favorite is the seafood curry. Delivery is fairly quick and comes in a nice takeout container with compartments.
Allison N.}Brooklyn, NY}191}43}22}-1}4}11/1/2014}HOT HOT DELICIOUS curry coming your way!I visited this location in St Marks twice now and absolutely LOOOVED it both times. The place is kinda smaller than expected. It has a bar kind of setting where the chefs will make the food in front of you. At least you can smell the yummy curry as they're making it, haha!!Anyways, onto the food! I believe they have a "lunch special" until 4pm, where you can get a free salad with your order. It consists of your basic greens, along with the house dressing. Es muy delicioso. I really love their menu because you aren't constricted to order one thing with a bunch of things that you don't want on it. You can order something basic like seafood curry and build to it by adding an egg and some Katsu! Basically mixing and matching, which is awesome.I ordered the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry, with CHEESE!!! If you're anything like me and love melted cheese in everything, DEFINITELY try this because it is mind-blowing. You will have a completely different outlook on Japanese curry. All you have to do is pour the grated cheese into the hot curry and it will melt like magic. You will thank me later. You're welcome.As for prices and what not, pretty pricy but I don't mind paying it for the quality of the food. The curry comes with some string beans and a slab of rice; each of these meals are around $12-$16. The add-ons like extra rice, eggs, cheese, cutlets, etc. are about $1-$4. Cheese is $1 BTW!! hahaha and also CASH ONLY, so remember to make a stop to the ATM before you come here to eat.
Mimi V.}Elk Grove, CA}307}617}811}18}5}11/1/2014}Best curry i've eaten thus far! While walking the streets of East village in New York on a Saturday night, it was hard to find a restaurant to dine in due to no reservations. Therefore, we stumbled upon this restaurant. Literally walking in with a party of 5 in this small 15 seater restaurant didn't seem like we were able to dine in, however, luckily they had exactly 5 seats for us! The plates i tried were: Baked seafood curry: Bomb curry with an egg on top to top things off! Very flavorful and delicious. Katsu chicken curry: Very delicious! Chicken fried to perfection! Crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. Very flavorful curry that paired with the rice very well. Dried beef curry: Very flavorful meat that was delicious! All the dishes here were very flavorful and delicious! I usually never finish my plate, however, i killed the dish in a quickness. It seems like they cook each dish carefully with tender and love. I highly recommend this place and would totally come back here when i am in New York!
Winny C.}New York, NY}5}18}1}-1}4}10/29/2014}The dried beef curry dish was good. But it is still overpriced, and the people serving the customers were not so friendly.
YuQuan T.}Brooklyn, NY}165}51}44}-1}4}10/25/2014}I'm serious about curry and after cooking it myself I know that this place got it right. the flavor, texture and consistency of the sauce is of something that was slow simmered for hours to get it all in there. you really couldn't go wrong with any of the selection on the menu. they're all good and each one has a little something different from every other. service wise, the place is pretty small so be a little patient with them because it is hard to move around. and they only take cash so be prepared.
Ivy T.}Fresh Meadows, NY}83}103}123}-1}5}10/20/2014}CASH ONLY!So for $15, you don't get a lot, a tiny side salad, curry (with no other ingredients inside) with Berkshire pork over white rice. However, I will come back because it is absolutely worth every penny. I think they curry is kinda suitable for all eaters. It is a little bit spicy, but only to the extent that any person can accept; it is also a little sweet. My bf actually ordered a second bowl of rice just for the curry. The berkshire pork cutlet is nothing but delicious, a bit more fat than the usual pork cutlet, but not greasy at all. The only con is that this restaurant is tiny (around 10 seats), so it is not good for a group dinner.
Eater O.}New York, NY}8}60}12}-1}5}10/16/2014}Sometimes I get a craving and the only thing that will fulfill it is a pork katsu curry with two shrimp on the side. This is one of my favorite places in NYC on one of the yummiest foodie streets.
Christine C.}Sunnyvale, CA}63}61}0}-1}2}10/12/2014}After seeing all the good reviews on Yelp, I was really expecting a good solid curry -- however, I don't think I received that here. I ordered the classic curry, and unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the classic had a strange sweet taste, and it was different from the normal sweetness of the Japanese curry I've had at Go-Go Curry, on the west coast, and in Japan. Instead, it didn't mesh very well with the usual taste of curry. Secondly, the curry did not include very many vegetables or potatoes or pieces of pumpkin, most of which are fairly cheap to add to a dish. However, the beef cubes (or at least the three of which I had in my curry) were very soft and tasty. The food would have warranted a rating of 3 stars or A-OK, but the service was also slightly rude.Even though the waitress and cooks were quick to give us food and the check, it was also quick to the extent that they were rushing my friend and me out. For example, they took away our napkins right after we finished even though we still needed to use them to wipe our mouths. Another instance was when we finished paying the bill. Only 2 minutes afterwards, the waitress asked us to leave because there were "people waiting for your seats"...which is fair, except there were only 2 people waiting outside, and aside from our seats, there were 3 other seats open. I understand that it's not a huge location, but a few minutes isn't a long amount of time, especially when there aren't actually people waiting for them.Overall, I would go to Go-Go Curry for better tasting curry, larger portions, and nicer service (even though it's little-to-none, at least you know what you're getting).
Myron L.}San Jose, CA}6}12}3}-1}2}10/12/2014}The Asian lady is pretty rude and impatient,  I saw she rolled her eyes at the couple sitting next to me. And the food was very disappointed to me. Especially my friend recommended me this place.  Never ever going to this allegedly Japanese curry resto again.
Carly L.}Ottawa, Canada}6}30}2}-1}5}10/11/2014}Service was friendly, fast and delicious! Cost was average to inexpensive for a nice hot dish. I have already recommended this to several people and would go back again.
Janet L.}Durham, NC}240}279}435}18}4}10/11/2014}My favorite curry place in nyc. I'm surprised there are not more Japanese curry places in the city especially in comparison to LA. But,  as far as I know,  this is the only Japanese curry place that serves the option of having it spicy. It is served in a black, metal pot hot right of the stove.  Yum!
Anthony W.}Manhattan, NY}0}102}56}-1}4}10/10/2014}A bit of a trek to get her for lunch today.Berkshire Cutlet Baked Curry!Take your curry cutlet and turn it up to 11.Soft baked egg and melted cheddar cheese in a bubbly hotpot was fantastic.It is expensive though. $18 + a beer is a lot for lunch, is its not an everyday excursion.I'm glad I gave it a try and will visit again in the future.
Hue L.}New York, NY}345}88}203}-1}4}10/9/2014}My favorite curry house ... The curry is never spotty or too thick in one place and too thin in another ... even consistency with the right seasoning.  I love how they have the cute presentation with the little curry pot and your own little stirring ladle.  The only thing is that it's cash only??? We didn't realize that until later but I would definitely come back here for curry if in the area!  The spicy curry was amazing!
Anqi Y.}New York, NY}3}12}1}-1}4}10/8/2014}A nice and clean hole-in-the-wall type of place with tasty Japanese curry. I satisfied my curry crave.
Jim A.}New York, NY}132}64}7}-1}3}10/6/2014}Had the Berkshire pork curry, which the menu listed as "popular." At $15 it was one of the pricier things on the menu, but I gave it a go.It arrived as a bowl of curry sauce (which was quite good), a medium sized portion of rice, and pork which was on the small size. For $15 I expected some sides or a little bigger portions, but it was okay.The pork was a little too fatty and chewy to justify the rest of the meal. The ambience are unique and the service was great, but I felt it was overpriced considering you can do better for cheaper elsewhere.Not bad but probably wouldn't return.
Weili H.}New York, NY}248}156}134}-1}4}10/2/2014}One of my favorite quick lunch spots in East Village, love their curry and even the rice served is perfect!
Jeanna S.}FRESH MEADOWS, NY}124}244}52}18}5}10/1/2014}Small, homey restaurant with only bar seats. Good place to eat alone.Great service.Good food - got the chicken cutlet curry. (it was served with curry on the side that you can ladle on)Small portions - overpriced. (like 99%of good NYC restaurants)Would come back - but not too often or else I might end up bankrupt.
Wade C.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}0}127}2}-1}5}10/1/2014}It's a little pricy, but nothing else comes close as far as I'm concerned. Even when delivered the curry and cutlet hold up well. The cherry on top is that they also have Japanese sodas like Ramune. If I want Japanese curry I know where I'm going.
Janet P.}New York, NY}0}15}0}-1}5}9/30/2014}Delicious and fragrant curry. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards.
Aras D.}Astoria, NY}4}3}0}-1}4}9/26/2014}This is definitely one of the best Japanese curry you can find in NYC. Ordered a dry curry and the melted cheese, curry together with warm rice underneath blends perfectly in your mouth. The only thing is that I did not expect the price is slightly higher for a curry place. I went with a friend and both of us spent 48 dollars excluding tips during lunch time..  Its definitely too expensive for lunch, so not a place you can't visit often during the day.Other than that, the foods are amazing as hell. Highly recommended
Veronica C.}New York, NY}24}109}15}-1}2}9/22/2014}Ick! I went here to find good Japanese curry.  I'm obsessed with Coco Ichibanya in Japan and haven't been able to find anything like it here. I was told this place is decent but absolutely not. I had fatty mystery meat chicken and the curry was almost sweet. Anyway, not my cup of tea. My search continues!
Qin P.}Hurlock, MD}2}2}2}-1}5}9/20/2014}This is my first comment on yelp . Curry here is sooooooo delicious and juicy!  I ordered baked vegetable curry and pork Katsu curry. With an egg and cheese on top and pork beside , I couldn't help myself and almost ate them all!
Sally R.}New York, NY}230}145}362}18}4}9/16/2014}More like 3 and a 1/2-ish. It was my first time, and I ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet to-go. The portions were good, and the meal was good, but, personally, I thought it was WAY overpriced. If I come back, I will get something else, because even though it was good, it wasn't worth $16. I'll stick with Go! Go! Curry for my Japanese curry needs because it's way cheaper and closer to me, anyway.*Note: The place is very small. They basically provide you with a bar to dine in on. Also cash only, like many other small Asian restaurants.
Zuzzi E.}New York, NY}188}551}17}-1}4}9/11/2014}400+ yelpers can't be wrong! This place is delish. It's grandma's kitchen meets old time diner. There are about a dozen seats overlooking the galley kitchen. I'm vegetarian and have been continually delighted with the vegetable medly (with extra corn) on brown rice. Yum!

Rich W.}Brooklyn, NY}56}165}31}-1}4}9/4/2014}Curry Katsu treated like a craft! The space is small but cozy; what makes this place that much more of an experience is being able to see the staff execute each order. The use of berkshire pork was money for the meal and the sauce was killer. The only issue I have at times is the wait because of the limited seating, but it's worth trying out at least once and I'm trying not to over hype this place.
Richard L.}Brooklyn, NY}1}11}0}-1}3}8/29/2014}Came here on a Tuesday for a quick affordable dinner.  Thank god it was Tuesday because they only have a tiny bar and although it was quite empty when I arrived, it filled up really quickly.  The different curry on the menu sound and look extremely appetizing, took me a while to pick something to eat.  Decided to go with the dry curry after my friend's recommendation.  Food came out pretty quick and it tasted pretty decent.  It was a little spicey, the mixture of fried onions, ground beef, and lightly scatter raisins tasted really well together. The curry was proportional to the amount of rice.  Overall good tasting curry but nothing spectacular or wow factor that pushes it above other curry spots.  The wait staff is rather attentive for the small space as well.  A nice quick dinner, wouldn't recommend going with more than 2 or 3 people.  I would come back here to try the other dishes and maybe next time, I will bump it up one more star.
Amber L.}Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY}47}114}8}-1}5}8/27/2014}Holy moly, this is some damn good Japanese curry.Is it more than you might usually spend on curry? Sure. It's also a very tiny establishment so don't go with more than MAYBE two friends. It's basically one long counter with a tiny bar along the window.But WHOA the baked curry. I know, it's about $3.50 added to the price of your curry. Inconsequential. It's unbelievably good. I'm vegetarian so I get the veggie curry (most curries seem to range from $8-$13, with veggie and plain being cheaper and pork katsu being more expensive, among others), which has tomatoes, eggplant (I think?), and carrots and maybe potatoes. This all gets dumped over rice in a little skillet bowl (they keep the bowls for vegetarian curries separate, that's sweet!) and covered in curry sauce. When you get the baked curry, you can't adjust the spice level but they will be happy to give you a small bowl of spicy paste to add to your curry upon request. This gets put in the over with a BAKED EGG AND SHREDDED CHEESE ON TOP. It's unreal.The pickled onions strategically placed in containers along the bar are absolutely the perfect addition to your baked curry. Cover your curry with them and then ask for more. Maybe take the ones from the onion station next to you. There's also onion flakes and some sort of pickled radish(? it's red, not sure). Both are also good. I always load up my leftovers with the toppings as well (one baked curry usually lasts me for dinner and a small but filling lunch the next day).It seems to be a popular location for takeout/delivery but I've eaten in twice there and eating your pot of baked curry bubbling straight out of the oven is not to be missed.
Daniel C.}New York, NY}8}80}1}-1}4}8/24/2014}Stopped in one evening an hour before closing and had no problem getting a seat. This is some of the best Japanese curry I've had! Good sized portioning and great flavour.The service was quick and friendly, looking at the comments, it seems like there is a big difference between the day and night shifts. I had one of the baked saucey curries (but totally will be back to try the dry curry), and while delicious, be prepaid to wait and wait and wait. In their defense, they are upfront about the preparation time (~15-20mins).The size of the baked curry is pretty big, could definitely see it being split between 2 people. If you get the baked curry, make sure you have a glass of cold water handy, it's HOT!Also , don't do go starving like I did or you will be caught in the following vicious cycle of pain and pleasure (or do if that's your thing):1. Wanting to shovel the delicious curry and melted cheese goodness into your mouth because you're starving.2. Awkwardly trying to blow on it with your mouth full as it burns your tongue.3. Quickly swallowing it and smiling because it's delicious.4. Subtly wiping the single tear dripping down your cheek from the intense scorching you just gave your tongue.5. Repeating until all curry is consumed or your tongue stops feeling anything.UPDATE Sept. 6/14:Came back to try the dry curry. It was decent but I'd stick to the regular stuff, that's where the flavour is at!
June Y.}New York, NY}292}11}33}-1}3}8/19/2014}honestly disappointing. i finally went here for lunch today after hearing so many rave reviews. my biggest complaint is that the dishes were too simplistic to justify their prices (each around $12-$16). i rarely cook, or be too snarky in reviews, but i've made tastier dishes with store-bought curry in the past :( i also didn't appreciate that there was only bar seating, which was unfortunate. however, the staff working there were all nice, which was a redeeming factor. i really wish i could like the place, but i just don't see myself coming back here in the near future, unless there is an apocalypse and people loot all the curry in stores.
Bob B.}Manhattan, NY}0}128}0}-1}4}8/9/2014}Delivers exactly what it promises - Japanese style curry dishes.  The sauces are good and follows classic recipe.  The cutlets are very well prepared - the right breading, the right oil, the right length of cooking.  Play by adding side ingredients.  The bar counter is crowded and limits the number of guests so take-away a good option.  I believe they are cash only so beware.
Steph M.}Manhattan, NY}295}118}0}-1}4}8/8/2014}Fantastic place to eat japanese curry. Small place with bar stools, but delicious cheesy curry with egg cracked over it was amazing and filling.
Lisa F.}New York, NY}1}4}2}-1}3}8/6/2014}Went here for lunch with a friend, got the chicken katsu curry which was great though a little overpriced for the portion. Still, probably some of the best curry in NYC.Unfortunately, horrible service ruined the good food. I usually don't mind bad/slow service if the food is great, but the lady behind the counter seemed to go out of her way to make us feel not welcomed. We were the only customers in the restaurant, and she seemed rushed to get us out of the place even though they were serving lunch for another 2 hours. Asked for our order when we had barely sat down, then brought us our check when we wanted to order more drinks. We were miffed and tipped 12%, and she had the nerve to bring the tip back and said we needed to tip 18-20%. We immediately left after that.
Tiffany L.}New York, NY}382}19}2}-1}4}7/30/2014}I got the baked curry over chicken katsu and my boyfriend got the minced beef dry baked curry. We both agreed that mine was a lot better!They cook everything right in front of you so that was interesting to watch.The place itself is a little tight but I still had a comfortable dinner.
Nam N.}Westminster, CA}66}11}3}-1}5}7/29/2014}My go to spot for Japanese curry.  The ambiance is nice and the food is excellent.  I usually get the seafood curry with an egg.  It's pretty gosh darn good.  After moving from NYC I still come back during visits.
Hui L.}Jersey City, NJ}2}5}0}-1}4}7/20/2014}The "baked" dry beef curry is great. Seafood curry is fine. Interesting that these guys baked the curry after it's almost done.Tiny place, good for eat alone or group less than 3.
Jason S.}Manhattan, NY}1}2}0}-1}1}7/15/2014}The owners have changed since I last been there but the curry is still pretty good. The problem is the new owner has the nerve to demand a 20% tip. I finished having lunch with a friend and we each put our share down on the bill with roughly a 15% tip. The lady who is the new owner returned the tab saying "tip is 20%." The place is a bar counter and you have to ask for water! Tip is also at the customers discretion, at least at other places！
Sujan P.}New York, NY}217}315}81}-1}2}7/14/2014}Service is pretty crap. The day shift girls seem to hate being there. Overpriced for what you get.Chicken katsu- I asked waitress if it's white meat/breast meat and she said "yes" I repeated "white meat" she confirmed. What I got was dark thigh meat. Cringe. I paid $14 for a plate of rice and curry sauce as I really didn't eat the chicken.That was the end of my review until as walking out the waitress stopped me to tell me that the tip is 18-20%. I responded that I was served dark meat rather than white meat as requested. She seemed confused and said she thought that was white meat. I explained thigh and leg is dark meat and breast is white meat. That I wasn't served what I requested. She said "oh ok. Good to know."  Nope, there was no apology for her ignorance. I should've demanded the tip that I did leave back. I paid to educate a waitress. How does that work?! I've been here a few times already. That was my last. Ever.
David Y.}San Francisco, CA}621}71}3}-1}1}7/13/2014}This place has the worst service I've ever experienced in New York. I came in around 11.58am with my friend and asked the server if the restaurant is open (it's supposed to open at 12noon). In the rudest voice I've ever heard, she pointed to a small "Closed" sign on the door and said, "What do you think the sign says?" Even though I was frustrated, I wanted to try the food here and asked when the restaurant would open. While rolling her eyes, the same server said, condescendingly, "when the sign says Open." I left and will never recommend this place to anyone.
A W.}San Jose, CA}44}208}1078}-1}3}7/10/2014}I love Japanese curry but this place was a disappointment. The curry was not flavorful enough and definitely not worth the price. The only great thing I have to say about this place is their toilet, which is a Japanese style one that can wash you with hot/cold water and etc. That's the most memorable thing about this place: the amazing Japanese toilet.
Ricki H.}San Francisco, CA}6}61}0}-1}3}7/10/2014}Is you live in the neighborhood,  then it's a decent place to go. Otherwise skip it. I was on business trip and I thought this place would be amazing. It's decent but it's not something memorable like ippudo ' s pork buns. Enjoy.
Eric R.}Westbury, NY}419}253}7}-1}4}7/7/2014}I came here extremely drunk and I honestly don't remember how I got home after leaving here. All I know is I left my friend's party and wanted some great food for cheap. I've been wanting to try one of these Japanese curry places for quite some time. I was debating if I should go to Go Go Curry near penn station or come here which was in walking distance of the bar I just came to. I'm glad I picked this place as it was closer and I was starving like a mofo. Its pretty nice inside. The restaurant must be fairly new. Its also small so no large groups. You can sit at the counter and eat but there are tables as well. Price is decent. I think Go Go Curry might be a bit cheaper and they offer a few more items on their menu. I ended up paying $15 for a full plate with a drink. Because I got there kinda late I didn't get to try the baked curry dish. They said it would take an extra 20 minutes to make and I was trying to get home before the sun came up. The pork cutlet curry was delicious. Can not wait to go back and try the other dishes. They open a little late, not sure if they deliver.
Josh K.}Jackson Heights, NY}291}1298}39}18}4}7/7/2014}It's GREAT, but damn is it expensive. Try the chicken katsu curry 'baked' version. I made the mistake of getting the super luxurious berkshire pork katsu curry baked, as well as a beer, and that brought my own personal total to $30 after tip! After sitting at a counter for 40 minute!I would also try the dry beef curry next time (not baked), and also not get a beer. The soba beer is interesting, but expensive, and interestingly enough, a domestic product made by Rogue brewery. It isn't bad, but is a pretty anonymous beer taste wise.Make sure to load your curry up with fukujinzuke (red pickles.)Definitely a lot better than Go!Go! but for my money I would rather get a "Home Run" there than pay for 1 baked curry.
Lou M.}Manhattan, NY}48}115}102}-1}3}7/6/2014}Ordered the pork.  It came out medium.  The not so happy waitress said sometimes it comes out medium and sometimes cooked.  Ummmm are you serious about that explanation.  Anyways sent it backed to be cooked.  She still didn't admit it was their fault
K S.}Manhattan, NY}104}140}38}-1}5}7/5/2014}My fav spot for katsu curry. Taste and quality remain the same throughout the years. Pork was not so fatty and it was fried to perfection.
Asa N.}Brooklyn, NY}18}109}165}-1}5}6/29/2014}I went to this place about 50 times since 2nd week they open. (I walked by this place and decided to try it) I LOVE CURRY! I can eat this everyday. This place have about 12 bar stools. Service could be little bit better sometimes. (Depends who the waitress is) Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's so so.
Abigail T.}Glendale, Queens, NY}2598}362}3340}-1}3}6/29/2014}Having missed the chance to try authentic Japanese curry on our recent trip to Tokyo, bf's eyes lit up as we drove by Curry-Ya. Our original destination was Otafuku so to stick with the Japanese theme we headed to Curry Ya after sharing an order of Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki and Medetai.Curry Ya is a small narrow restaurant consisting of bar seating except for two seats by the window.We got Yuba Salad and Japanese Classic. The salad was pretty. Tofu skins, Parmesan and green beans piled on top of each other. Taste does not quite reach expected goodness tho. I'd skip this if I were to return.The curry had squash, carrots and pieces of beef served with white rice. You can add pork or chicken cutlet to it for an additional fee but we opted just for the curry and rice. It was curry. Anything special or different? None.Would I come back? Maybe.
Brian L.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}509}604}1466}18}3}6/27/2014}While looking for impossible parking near St. Marks, we passed by Curry-Ya with curiousity.  Of all the things we ate in Tokyo, not once did we ever get Japanese curry.  After a quick appetizer at Otafuku and a full stomach, we decided to pass by Curry-Ya anyway.  Full but not full, we went inside and sat by the counter.  It's a small shop consisting of just counter side seating.  The menu was simple.  We ordered the Yuba salad (supposednly it's most popular) that was nicely presented.  String beans sandwiched between tofu skin and parmasean.  Looked great, but it actually nothing to rave about.  We opted for the Japanese curry since we were somewhat full.  The Berkshire Pork did look good, but afraid it was too heavy.  We ordered the Old Fashion Japenanese curry, which had beef, carrots, potatoes, asparagus and cheese (maybe)Food was okay, but I doubt I'll be making another trip
Tiffany W.}New York, NY}240}275}145}18}4}6/17/2014}Came here with a friend. The venue is kind of small. It's pretty much like bar seating. I would say it would fit about 10 people at most. There are convenient hooks under the table though!They had some interesting items on the menu like baked curry. Never even heard of that before, but then again I don't think I would want to add cheese on top of curry XD. I tried the pork katsu curry medium spicy - it was really good, but I found the pork to be a little bit on the dry side. The spiciness isn't very spicy so if you can handle spicy food go hotter. The curry itself was perfectly thick and tasted good.Overall, pretty good.
Hannah P.}Los Angeles, CA}173}157}284}-1}4}6/15/2014}Oh man, I'm so glad this was my first stop upon landing in New York.My friends and I got to New York after a 12-hour megabus journey and Curry-Ya was just around the corner from where we were staying. It was pretty late so there was no wait. There weren't enough seats for all of us to sit together, but a patron kindly moved over one seat to make room for us. We quickly sat down and placed our orders.Curries tend to make me feel a little groggy because so many different ingredients go into it, so I end up eating more than I realize. But Curry-Ya does it just right! I got the original plain curry which comes with a small pot of curry and a ball of rice. (It doesn't seem like much, but it fills you right up. You might even have some leftovers.) I think what makes Curry-Ya so special is the broth of the curry. There weren't a whole lot of different ingredients in the curry, but the broth was amazing. It packed a punch without being too heavy. I could tell that there were a lot of spices in it and it was cooked for awhile to let the spices and flavors steep for awhile longer.Classic Japanese restaurant: clean, small, and efficient.
Dewan A.}Haledon, NJ}664}1346}1630}-1}5}6/7/2014}Amazing place to get Japanese curry and katsu. I had the Japanese Classic with a side of berkshire cutlet. Only issue is, it is cash only. I wanted to get lassi, however, did not have cash on hand for a bill over 20 USD. However, I will come back for Japanese curry again.
Jenn F.}Brooklyn, NY}767}372}2328}18}4}6/4/2014}The last time I tried Japanese curry, it was a real disaster.  Hello Kitty was killed in a kitchen fire.  This time I met up with one of my most animated friends for a nice catch-up date.  She had been here multiple times and boasted about the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry.I went with her favorite and ordered it in medium heat; the creamy curry arrived in a small bowl with a proper ladle.  The perfectly fried pork was placed upon a generous heap of white rice(brown rice goes against all the gluttonous things I believe in).  The comical part of the dish came in the form of three 1" green beans.  Very awkward.  I'm obviously not into veggies, but it made the dish seem unbalanced.  Whatever, I still felt that I fulfilled my daily serving of greens.A tasty dish, coupled with my signature Sapporo beer, made this meal pretty unbeatable.  Space was limited, but a fellow patron clued me into the hooks for bags located under the counter.  All my ladies(and men who carry 'murses') can breathe a sigh a relief.  Don't ever let a heavy load prevent you from eating.  Hmm.. wait a minute.
Jill R.}New York, NY}498}91}479}-1}4}6/2/2014}People usually will talk about their love for Go! Go! Curry, but this place wins my heart when it comes to Japanese curry. The baked Berkshire pork curry comes baked WITH eggs AND cheese OVER a bed of rice!!! It's been a while since I went, but I'm craving it again just talking about it now, despite the warmer weather. But it's seriously the best spot when it's a cold NY night and you need some warmth in your life. This is another must go-to spot I drag out of towners to check out!
Thy L.}Brooklyn, NY}67}284}340}18}5}5/30/2014}Yuba salad is perfectly hand made with green beans, tofu skin, and parmesan cheese. Dry curry is always my go to with adjustable spicy level (mild/medium/hot)Perfect comfort food!
Hayoung B.}New York, NY}21}25}51}-1}4}5/29/2014}The dry beef curry is a must try! It's my favorite dish here! Also if you're looking for a sweet drink to pair with you entree, I recommend the lychee lassi. Just make sure you have cash on you!
Hannah H.}Alexandria, VA}436}3786}28849}18}5}5/26/2014}I've been wanting to try this place out for some time, so I was pretty excited to check them out on our recent trip.  Curry-Ya offers 'gourmet Japanese curry,' which which the sauce is made from chicken and oxtail soup, veggies, fruits, and special spices.  They supposedly stew for 8 hours to provide a nice thick sauce.  Their menu offers plain/vegetable/chicken/'dry' curries, katsu curries, salads, and toppings (katsu, hamburger steak, shrimp, etc.).  My husband and I shared the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry with a Housemade Corquette (deep-fried mashed potato with ground beef).  There was a small glass bowl of Green Salad that was served, which contained mesclun greens, tomato, cucumber, with their nice and light house dressing (vinaigrette) - very fresh and delicious (the salad is complimentary during their lunch hours from 12-4PM)!  The curry comes in a sauce pot, which was quite flavorful and delicious, and I like how you get to control how much sauce you want (I poured the whole baby all over everything!)!  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the flavor as it was nice and just the right amount of thickness.  The pork was of great quality and fried well.  I absolutely LOOOVED the croquette, as it was a nice size and was quite delicious, with the mashed potatoes and ground beef within - literally one of the best, if not the best, croquette I've had!  YUM!  The female server was very reserved, but she was very efficient and sweet.  The place is a bar style, in which you sit at the counter with limited seating.  The place itself was brightly-lit and very clean.  I really enjoyed this place and definitely recommend! :D+Green Salad - refreshing!+croquette (MMM)+flavorful curry!+counter seating only+friendly staff :D
Vania K.}Seattle, WA}594}585}369}18}4}5/23/2014}CASH ONLY! I automatically wanted to hate this place for being cash only. I always take it very personally when places refuse to take credit cards. I like to think that they adopt this policy strictly to make my life less convenient. OK, I'm done with that rant. My friend and I decided to have dinner at the last minute this past Tuesday and she randomly chose this place. At about 7:30pm, we were lucky to snag the last two open seats available. We both ordered the baked curry (she ordered the pork katsu and I ordered the chicken katsu). It was SOOO GOOD. The baked curry takes 20 minutes to cook and you can add the baked curry option to any of the curry for an additional $3.5 (we found the asterisk noting the baked curry exclusion a bit confusing). So we chatted for a bit (although honestly I was so hungry, I was really trying to distract myself by watching passerbys), while waiting for our glorious baked curry to arrive. Great comfort food! The curry is tasty and my chicken was perfectly cooked (and they're pieces of white meat chicken, yay!). Who knew that adding egg and cheese, and then baking the curry over rice would result in such greatly satisfying and oddly balanced flavors? The portion is kind of small (given the price), but it's such a great comfort meal. Service was fast and friendly. The place is small and as far as I could tell, there's only one person taking orders, serving food and refilling water. She was so attentive, my glass never sat empty. She also seemed to be so genuinely excited to be there (or she faked it well, which I appreciate equally). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I'd say the best table is the two seats facing out the window (great people watching!).
Min N.}Gramercy, Manhattan, NY}3}8}6}-1}4}5/15/2014}its a very nice little restaurant that serves great japanese curry sauce. The environment is very home like and tidy; the service there is great.
Cyrstal C.}New York, NY}7}27}0}-1}5}5/9/2014}Great modern Japanese Curry place!Their Japanese curry is the best in the city!Good for delivery, fast and the food is goodd!Yummy = )
Jane L.}ASTORIA, NY}33}182}921}-1}4}5/6/2014}Excellent curry, cooked to perfection. Free condiments on the table. Open kitchen, countertop seating. Small space so not for groups. Love the seafood curry and the Berkshire pork katsu!
Adeline L.}Jersey City, NJ}0}4}0}-1}5}5/4/2014}My go-to for curry! Baked is MUST TRY.Their small salad is nicely portioned for girls who wish to nib a bit of greens on the side but not get overwhelmed. Only down side is the tiny space. For "rush hour" go with 1 other person, makes it much easier to get seats.
Ke S.}Jersey City, NJ}3}2}9}-1}5}5/1/2014}best curry ever!!!!!!!so good that I can finish every drop of the original Japanese curry!!!!!!!!!! We always come here and the lychee lassi is delicious too~
Judy K.}Manhattan, NY}5}8}2}-1}5}4/20/2014}I wish this placed opened up another location in the upper west. Generally, I don't have much cravings for curry, but they seriously make the best curry in NYC. I take all of my curry lovers to Curry Ya, and they make it their spot to fulfill their curry cravings! I always get the seafood curry with extra cheese and corn. The pink radishes are excellent sides to go with it. The house salad that comes with the lunch combo is very flavorful. I must say, the dressing isn't ranch or blue cheese - like, heavy flavorful, but balsamic-like, refreshing flavorful. The greens and the paprikas are crunchy and fresh- I love it. I think it says that it's only 3 dollars on the menu for a house salad, but it does say a lot about how much care they put into the details. And this really shows! :) Thank you curry ya for being so awesome. :)
LV C.}New York, NY}7}198}0}-1}4}4/20/2014}1) Japanese classic curry-- very good2) Baked chicken curry-- very good3) Lychee lassi-- good
Cecilia G.}New York, NY}39}72}103}-1}5}4/9/2014}This is the BEST CURRY in NYC.    I've been here many times.   The Baked Curry with Bershire Pork was amazing.    Somehow they were able to have the pork katsu still have that crispy texture even though it was baked under the sauce.   Tasted awesome.  For people who like their food spicy, get it extra spicy.    I'd normally give a restaurant like this 4 stars, but since it's the best curry in NYC, I'm giving it 5 stars.
Jack Straw S.}New York, NY}40}196}153}-1}4}4/5/2014}Walked by here many times and it is usually filled(it only seats12 or so) but today there were only two other people and in we go. The menu is pretty simple and I didn't try any of the baked curry. Settled on the mixed green salad, mini pork katsu and the potato and ground beef croquet which was amazing. Also shared the classic Japanese curry which had beef with a red wine undertone, squash, potatoes, and a med spicy sauce as per request. The white rice was substituted with brown rice. We had a soda and green tea for a grand total of 25$ This was a a perfect amount of food for two. I can't wait to come back and try some of the baked curry. Well worth heading here for lunch or dinner.
David N.}Brooklyn, NY}121}573}801}18}4}4/1/2014}This tinny tiny cash only diner shop does one thing and only one thing. Japanese curry. Most of the time there is a wait line. Call me old fashion but I like the standard curry with dried beef on rice. If you want spicy you have to ask for extra spicy as even the 'hot' isn't very. I know the popular baked curry but it is just too much and everything is all gloopy. The Katsu chicken was nice and crispy with the side of curry and rice. The radish and pickled onions add a nice tart to the meal. The meal is simple and satisfying. Itadakimasu!
Karthik R.}Harrison, NJ}0}28}491}-1}4}3/25/2014}Japanese is not all sushi!!!  Have to try this hole-in-the-wall Japanese curry joint...  Nothing but delicious!!!  Baked Katsu Chicken Curry is a MUST try... Ask for their homemade hot sauce, if you like to spice up u'r entree.  Don't forget to add the table garnishes, Fried Onion and Pickled Garlic, to u'r entree.  They don't have a huge selection of drinks. But, what they have accompanies the food well, especially the two beers they have...Good for smaller groups of 2-4.  The smaller the group the easier u'll get a seat as it is bar type seating with approximately 12 seats at the bar.
M M.}New York, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}3/24/2014}Exactly the Japanese curry I had been waiting for in NYC.So delicious that I'd love to learn their recipe.Perfect flavor and thickness in curry. And the katsu are crispy and thick enough for someone who seeks volume in your meal.The place is clean BUT I really HOPE that those boys in the kitchen will stop playing with their cell phone with their sanitary gloves on. Can you touch your smartphones once you take your gloves off!!!!!!!!!!!I wish I could visit once a week at least.
Katherine W.}New York, NY}12}5}3}-1}5}3/17/2014}Me and my friend went during the lunch special hour so we had a bowl of green salad. The sauce was very Japanese but also very tasty. I had the curry with potato and pumpkin in mild spiciness. It have a mouth-watering scent which made me dig right into the curry, even making me forget to take a photo! The pumpkin and the potato gave the texture of the curry a just the righty amount of thickness and sweetness. The spiciness was unnoticeable until I finished a good half of the plate. It dish was definitely enough for one person. Definitely goes well with lemon and coke, but this is might be just me. My friend ordered the coffee jello. As a one with an amazingly large sugar tooth, the first bite of the jello with thick cream made me cringle in bitterness. However after a few seconds a scent of richness and sweetness comes in. The things aren't even expensive!This just made my day.
Ruby C.}San Francisco, CA}115}162}56}-1}4}3/16/2014}Absolutely delicious. It's a small place without any tables and just counter room but that doesn't really bother me at all when their food is so good! The person behind the counter estimated 30 minutes but thanks to some clever maneuvering we were seated in 5. I got the dry curry with berkshire pork katsu and shrimp katsu add on. As a spicy lover I read through the reviews and noticed that it's not very spicy so I got extra spicy for mine - good call! Their spicy is not that spicy at all.. almost american food level of spiciness. I was absolutely stuffed by the end of our meal but I couldn't resist their coffee jello - it had a very crumbling like texture, not "chewy" or "Q" as I thought it'd be but still good.This place is cash only so be prepared to shell out the greens when you come!
Agustin K.}New York, NY}703}1004}441}18}3}3/14/2014}I crave Japanese curry and I ended up here.  This was the second time and unfortunately it didn't give me that satisfaction.They serve gourmet curry.  The baked version is an interesting twist to the good old Japanese curry.  Topped with plenty of cheese and one egg and baked for about 10 minutes, rice in the bottom.  Let's dissect: the Berkshire pork, or any topping of your choice, is no longer crunchy (which was the texture I crave for).  The melted cheese curry medley has a completely different taste notes than the good old Japanese curry.  The half baked egg is awesome and was the highlight of the dish for me.  This is great for when you want to try something new but not exactly fulfilling my craving.The other dish we ordered is the hamburger one.  Superb!  That hit the spot for me.I love the dried onion topping!  I finished half of the container.  The radish and pearl onion pickle are also great condiments.  We got to try the buckwheat beer which is certainly a repeat.  Service is very efficient, a bit cold but the three people behind the bar got things done.  Oh and if you like your curry spicy, make sure you ask for super extra hot and not just hot.
Josh A.}Littleton, CO}2}90}0}-1}3}2/17/2014}Pretty standard fare. I got the Berkshire Pork Curry which was good. I don't think it's special in any way and it seems overpriced. I thought the service was ok, prompt, but not especially welcoming.
Yanfen L.}New York, NY}7}7}0}-1}5}2/15/2014}Didn't know Japanese Curry would be that good.  Classic Japanese Curry with chicken or pork cutlet is amazing. Must try.  The two things i think they could do better is to add more rice and enlarge the restaurant (can't come with more than three people at a time).
Wei Lah P.}Oakland, CA}4}30}1}-1}4}2/15/2014}The food here tastes delicious! However the customer service was really unpleasant. Maybe it was just the waitress, but she was short tempered and rude. Anything on the menu is a go!!
Kyung-Bo L.}Manhattan, NY}1}17}3}-1}4}2/14/2014}Really interesting place to stop by for japanese style curry. All their curry are recommended. Not only their curry are great but also their awesome toppings goes well with the curry sauce. May be little bit expensive for a simple meal, but worth a visit.
Yng L.}Astoria, Queens, NY}41}35}0}-1}4}1/31/2014}Curry-Ya is consistent, tasty and filling. I usually get the vegetable curry (spicy) with a shrimp croquette or two on the side. Seating is limited, but the bar is charming and brightly lit. There are cubbies in the stools and coat hooks along the bar. Not ideal for parties.Service is prompt. Try their version of creme caramel. It is delightful and refreshing after a comforting bowl of curry. I consider it the perfect dessert. Cash only.
Vy N.}Bronx, NY}45}42}26}-1}4}1/24/2014}I am in love with their Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry and their beef dried curry. It's a very small place but it definitely does not define the quality of their curry. As people have mentioned, they do the same, or very similar curry base for all of their dishes but I don't mind it too much since it's really good. If it was bad then that's another thing but I have nothing to complain about. Love this place! Make sure to bring cash, that's all they'll take!
Erika P.}Union Square, Manhattan, NY}2}10}35}-1}5}1/7/2014}Everything they do here is simply wonderful from the Berkshire pork cutlets to the add on pickles and corn. It's a shame that they are so expensive but there's nothing I'd rather spend my money on.
Cynthia M.}Manhattan, NY}353}1225}25}-1}5}1/6/2014}Curry (Kare) isn't one of the first things that come to mind when I think of Japanese cuisine, but it is actually one of the most popular comfort food dishes of Japan. It's base is usually made of vegetables (onions, carrots, potatoes) and meat (beef, pork, chicken). It is most often served over rice, although noodles (kare-udon) and bread (kare-pan) are also common as well. In comparison to other commonly known curries, in my opinion, it is sweeter than an Indian curry and less acidic and floral than a Thai curry. There is a great depth of flavor and richness to Japanese curry which combines both sweet and savory characteristics, and the sauce coats your tongue just right (just past 'nappe' which is the term we used in culinary school to describe a sauce that has the ideal consistency to coat the back of a spoon).At Curry-Ya, they refer to their version as "gourmet Japanese curry" and according to their website "the sauce is made from chicken and oxtail soup, a large variety of vegetables, fruits and special spices. The special sauce is stewed continuously for 8 hours to produce the amazingly rich and complex flavors that we boast about." Now, that sounds amazing! I decided to take a visit and give it a try for myself. I came to Curry-Ya with my friend Cho on a cold Saturday afternoon around 1pm. The freezing temperatures and the half a foot of snow on the ground made it the perfect day to try some Japanese comfort food. The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived. It was made up of an open kitchen and an L-shaped wooden bar. We were able to get a couple of heavy wooden barstools all the way to the back away from the cold winter air by the front door. Though my intention was to just share a dish with my friend and save our appetites to try a few other snacks in the area, he threw a bit of a fit and wanted a whole plate to himself. Hungry people can't be controlled and I decided to give in and we both perused our menus trying to decide what to order. Knowing his preferences (I have quite the knack for guessing what people would like from a menu), I suggested the Berkshire Pork Katsu (deep fried pork cutlet) Curry, which he ordered. As for myself, I kept it simple with the Vegetable Medley Curry. I wanted the least amount of distraction in my curry dish, but didn't want just a plate of rice and sauce. We both opted for medium spiciness, preferring a bit a of heat but not too much where we can't taste the food. Since it was lunchtime, both orders came with a small refreshing side salad lightly dressed with some lemon juice. Shortly after, our entrees came, with both of our curries on the side in a gravy boat. His Berkshire pork cutlet was perfectly prepared, crispy and not greasy at all. The three green beans on the side were a bit sad and lonely, but I guess those were just an afterthought. Japanese minimalism, perhaps? My mixed vegetables were in the boat with the curry and we both just poured the curry into our main plates ready to enjoy our meal. The curry had many levels of flavor; the chicken and oxtail soup and long cooking time gave it a deep richness. There were sweet notes to the curry, which was probably a result of the fruits and spices and it was definitely the star of our plates. Even the Berkshire pork katsu took a back seat to the curry, but was still a great supporting star. The vegetables in my curry included mushrooms, squash, sweet potato, white potato and carrots and gave my dish more texture which was quite nice. On the counter were a couple of pickled accompaniments, rakkyo (sweet pickled scallions) and pickled daikon. A common accompaniment is Fukujinzuke which is a mixture of Japanese radish (daikon), lotus root, cucumber and eggplant preserved in a soya sauce and sweet cooking wine (mirin) base, but I guess they opted for the more simple pickled daikon. Both gave a nice sweet and crunchy bite that paired well with the sweet and spiciness of the curry. In the end, Cho is a bit more partial to Indian curry, but he did enjoy his first Japanese curry experience and would have it again. As for me, Japanese curry is definitely one of my favorite comfort foods, but so rich and heavy that I wouldn't be able to eat it all the time. It is complex but still comforting, with such a depth of flavor that you don't see that often (I could almost compare it to a Mexican mole in its build up of flavors). It will be in my dining rotation and a great way to get through this cold and wet winter. Curry-ya is a great option for this dish, but I do hope to explore other Japanese curry restaurants in the future as well.
Y H.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}26}10}4}-1}5}1/5/2014}Curry ya! The very small restaurant with incredible Japanese curry! It was one of the best japanese curry! Love it
Al L.}New York, NY}0}86}69}-1}4}1/4/2014}Tiny, nicely decorated space with polite workers. Food is great; all curry spice levels are good. Consistently a great experience.Cash only. Remember to bring bills.
Eugene L.}New York, NY}303}185}76}-1}4}1/3/2014}Ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet and enjoyed it. The curry was tasty. Service was great as well, would come back.
Gene T.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}1/2/2014}This is one of my fave places for curry in the city -- the food is just good. I go there with friends every few months. I went there with my sis for lunch today. We were served by a Japanese woman we've never seen before and she was not that enthusiastic but I didn't mind anyways at first. I ordered the Bershire pork curry and my sis ordered veggie curry which I was so curious about at first, coz she likes meat a lot! And my sis later told me that she would like to get some toppings but that waitress just took the menu back right away after she ordered the curry!!!!!! We tipped the waitress at 15% when finished, and the waitress was so greedy and kept saying to us that "usually our guests tip 15-20% or above"!! I looked at her for a few seconds and put few more dollars on the table and walked out. My sis just said that other places in the city would offer same quality of curry and I don't think I would return to this place anymore.
Pete S.}Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY}69}217}3}-1}5}12/30/2013}Nothing quite cuts through the cold of a New York winter like a little spicy curry! Yes, it appears they use the same curry base for all of their curries. But that curry-base is the bomb-diggity -- so nevermind the haters! Also - it means you can't go wrong with no matter what curry you get (unless you get the dry curry, but I hear that's great too) Get the lychee lassi as well -- you won't regret it. Cash only and limited bar-only seating -- keep that in mind.
Apurva N.}Manhattan, NY}28}186}0}-1}3}12/24/2013}We went here for dinner a couple of days ago I really think this is an interesting place!I never thought that Japan and curry went together, so my wife wanted to prove otherwise.The restaurant is really tiny and has the feel of a sushi bar when you walk in. Luckily it wasn't busy, and we were able to get seats immediatelyI ordered the Dry Curry, and my wife ordered the Chicken Curry. I asked for the Dry Curry to be me "Hot" - their scale ranges from "Mild" to "Medium" to "Hot".When the curries arrived, I thought mine was a bit bland. It also reminded me of standard chili! Maybe its my palette, but I really felt that it was pretty bland.My wife's Curry was a little less bland, but maybe its just the way the Japanese do curry.Overall, a pretty decent experience - something I would try again.I want to give this place 3.5 stars, but I will reserve my final opinion for another visit.3 stars, and I will be back! You should try it!
Rebecca J.}New York, NY}34}52}3}-1}4}12/5/2013}Love this place! I am not a fan of katsu in general, but I really like japanese style curry. So I usually get the hamburger curry and add the baked option (for 3.50). So good! Comes in a little hot pot/pan sort of thing and the rice and hamburger and curry are baked with an egg and some cheese on top! I really recommend it!
Randy E.}Menlo Park, CA}1}41}1}-1}5}11/24/2013}Best Japanese curry around. Hands down. Took my in-laws (from Tokyo) here and they loved it. My wife and I go at least once a month and have the pork cutlet curry with a bottle of beer.Small and intimate. Seating is all at the marble counter. I think it only seats about 10 people. Weeknights tend to be the best time to go as there is little wait.
Michael S.}New York, NY}6}65}23}-1}4}11/14/2013}Got to try the Berkshire pork katsu curry and the seafood curry. As other reviewers have mentioned, the portions are not huge. In the seafood there were maybe 3 shrimp, some squid pieces (no tentacles, unfortunately) and 3 or 4 small scallops about nickel sized. Both dishes also came with a small football shaped mound of rice. Tasted pretty good.Small place, maybe 12 seats, all basically on a counter facing the kitchen. However, the atmosphere is still pleasant. The way the food is served is also cute. The curry comes in a small cast iron pot straight from the over. Perhaps a bit on the pricey side considering the portions but not exactly going to break the bank either. Seafood was $14 and pork was $15.Compared to Go Go Curry (which I love, btw) the curry is a bit lighter. Not only in texture but also in color (slightly more yellow while Go Go Curry is a dark brown).Went at 7pm on a Wednesday and had about a 10 minute wait.
Rachel S.}Greenwich, CT}34}156}93}-1}5}11/9/2013}First off- delicious.It was a very small, unassuming place we ended up going to after we thought we wanted to go to our old stand by, rai rai ken, but there was a long line. This totally exceeded my expectations!The inside was definitely warm and toasty, perhaps a bit too hot at times, but it didn't bother me because it ultimately added to the atmosphere these guys have set up.A very small kitchen, where you can see everything, every plate being washed and every dish being cooked, including yours, which I liked! 2 people cannot even fit back to back in the kitchen, so the waitress has to lean over the cook to give us our waters and utensils! But everyone was in good spirits and we had good service with such close quarters. I got the Hayashi rice, which is not the same curry sauce as the original. But for that, I am glad! It's tomato based with sauteed mushrooms, onions, thinly sliced beef, and a slight tang in the sauce and it had amazing flavor. I would get this again in a heartbeat. Very filling. My other friends got the baked curry and the katsu curry, both were very good!I would highly recommend this restaurant!
Esther P.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}3}11/7/2013}my husband and i wanted to order in for dinner. we called at 8 and ordered 2 curry entrees and a side salad. we finally got our order an hour later (they got our address wrong after repeating it to the girl on the phone twice). when we got the order, it was missing the side salad, and the degree of spiciness was wrong. we called and got the salad in good time (10minutes or so). the delivery guy was super nice and apologetic, which wasn't even his fault. the ordering process for delivery- very very poor.the food- good.
Jingqiao H.}Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY}129}147}1883}18}4}11/7/2013}I've been there just once so far and ordered the Japanese Classic. The place was small, but the food was amazing. The curry was not like some other places where the curry is just plain and boring. Curry-Ya's has a more sophisticated flavor and the aftertaste stays in your mouth for a long time.I didn't know that the Berkshire pork is its must-try, so it will be my dinner next time.
Amer N.}New York, NY}39}69}103}-1}4}11/3/2013}The space is pretty small (bar seating only) but it is intentional. The concept is traditional Japanese curry service, where you pick out of 5-6 curries and get it cooked in front of you in about 5 minutes (similar to authentic ramen bars). I tried the Dry Beef curry which comes with ground beef, sliced hard broiled egg, and crispy onion flakes.I did not expect this combination of flavors to work, but it really does, and the added texture is great. Very satisfying portion, too.They a nice selection of Japanese beers to pair with your food. I went with the server's recommendation and it was nice & light.After 10 minutes of enjoying my dish, my check was ready by my plate (an even 12 bucks) and I was ready to go! It took 15 minutes total, which is great if you're catching a movie at the AMC nearby or have other plans after.The only reason I am giving a 4 is that it's CASH ONLY which I hate. Get with the times...
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}4}10/21/2013}I made the mistake of deviating from the norm again. Curse self for trying something new! I should've gotten the Berkshire pork katsu instead of the "hambaga stew" (hamburger for those of you who couldn't translate that). Cheese on anything sounded nice, but next time I will say no. Sticking to the katsu.
Mike D.}Hawley, PA}14}13}6}-1}4}10/21/2013}I am in love with Hiroko's, which is still my favorite NYC spot in all NYC, but Curry-ya is also really good for those times when you are on a curry craving kick.  First off, the Chicken Katsu was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  OMG amazing!!!! The cutlet was large, moist, and crispy.  I got the Chicken Curry, she got the Chicken Katsu Curry... I stole a lot of her Chicken Katsu (sorry honey, but your meal is to die for).  The chicken curry was very good too, but yeah... you get the point about that Chicken Katsu.Oh, things you should know about before you go here.  This place is super small.  Like, don't take bags, and prepare to keep your jacket on your lap.  This is just a small counter you sit around, no table.  And, bring cash.  Your plastic god is not welcome here.
Yume K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}35}9}-1}4}10/15/2013}One of my favorite places in the city to take friends, because most people don't know Japanese curry and this is a cute little joint that does it very well. (Hey guys, you know Japanese food isn't just sushi and ramen, right?)The prices are reasonable and you get the fun of watching them make your food in what has to be the narrowest kitchen in the world. Despite the size, I've never had to wait too long, because they are pretty efficient and customers turn over fairly quickly.And, if you like this place, for a fancier occasion, check out Soba Ya also in the neighborhood, which I think is by the same guy.NOTE: I think technically the Vegetable Curry here is not Vegetarian, because the curry may be made with some sort of meat stock or something. I pretend I don't know that when I eat here though.
Jessica O.}ASTORIA, NY}61}131}664}-1}4}10/14/2013}Having tried the Berkshire pork katsu don and returned for this specific dish, I decided to return when I was craving curry. Go-Go Curry just didn't do it for me. This time I decided to try the vegetarian curry and have it baked. I had meant for the cheese and egg to act as vegetarian protein sources. They are, but the flavors didn't meld with the rest of the dish. The curry was spicier than I would have liked, distracting me from the rest of the dish and even though cheese accentuates mushrooms and eggs, it does not go well with squash and enoki mushroom. Next time I decide to go for the baked version I'll just have this with plain curry.
Deepu G.}New York, NY}230}18}4}-1}5}10/11/2013}Would you forsake most foods for a bowl of full-on legit Japa-curry?  Do you sometimes want to feel like you're in Tokyo for the cost of a walk to the East Village?Then don't go here.  There isn't space for you and my personal 3-course setting in this petite resto.(...seriously, try to come without jackets or bags)
Mike Y.}Brooklyn, NY}71}190}62}-1}5}10/7/2013}Damnit I love this place.I've been looking for a good japanese curry place since my beloved Yagura market closed down. Everything that I've had from Katsuhama to OmsB to Zaiya has not met the mark. However, upon a recent trip to next door Hi-Collar, my lady's sharp eyes caught the Curry-ya sign.We went for dinner around 630-7-ish on a Saturday night. There was a short wait 5-10 minutes. The place itself is small, clean, lots of white. Maybe 10-15 bar seats. 2 facing out to the street by the window, and the remainder at the counter. Modern.The curry was a bit pricy for curry but...hey, it was delicious. Around $13 a bowl gives you a small stoneware with curry and a plate with rice (in comparison my sweet Yagura dished it out at around $7/box of deliciousness). Looks can be deceiving as the portion although initially small-looking is rather filling (im a fatty, yes, its filling). I had the chicken katsu. The katsu was perfectly fried, delicious. The curry is a bit sweet but just the way i like it. The gf got the japanese classic which has carrots, kabocha, and beef. Tastes like the same curry just with the beef and added ingredients. The beef is soft, tender, easy to munch. The kabocha and carrots add additional savory sweet.Little curry fixings on the side. Crunchy pieces of garlic. Pickles.you can also add a potato croquette with beef which is pretty good for $3. And a $4 seaweed salad with mesculun greens - also good. Dressing is a little sweet and mayonnaise-y.$5/bottle of sapporo. Finally I've found a substitute for Yagura. Thinking about this place makes me hungry. PS Cash only. PPS. I also wanted to reiterate Ed. L's comment. This is not a great first date place. It is not a 'romantic' 'cozy  'cute' restaurant with candles and dim lighting. This is like...lets grab something delicious to eat in a clean environment. its like a super clean bar that serves only curry. Like what uniqlo would be if it was tiny and served curry.
Jeremy C.}Manhattan, NY}0}20}0}-1}5}10/4/2013}Cures my pork katsu curry fix and that wheat beer Ginga Kogen is awesome. Love this place
Ed L.}Manhattan, NY}1183}348}644}-1}4}10/2/2013}Curry-ya is a cute downtown restaurant to get Japanese style curry.  I've enjoyed both the Japanese Classic curry as well as the Berkshire Pork Katsu curry.  On both occasion I've ordered medium which is still a bit too warm for my tastes so if you're sensitive to spice then I recommend sticking with mild.  I would have given this location 5-stars however there are two things that prevent me from doing so; the small cramped location and the cash only policy.  While there's not much that can be done about the size, just be forewarned that this is not an ideal location for a date.  The cash only policy is just plain annoying.  Other than that, I'm sure you'll enjoy your experience.
Daniel B.}New York, NY}407}610}349}18}4}9/30/2013}I am in love.  If this place were a girl, she'd need not work hard to curry favor with me.  She'd be perfect--a cultural mutt with a saucy personality.Curry-Ya's a teeny place--a counter with seating for maybe 15.  The staff work on the opposite side of the counter, firing up the curry bowls and doing all the prep right before you.  It's not particularly elaborate, but it's still fun to watch your food be made. I had the "classic" beef+veg curry, with additions: extra veggies, a hard-boiled egg, and cheese.  Delicious!  All the curries I saw looked equally delicious, like you maybe can't go wrong no matter what you get.One important note on spiciness: they offer these curries in mild, medium, and hot.  The hot here is equivalent to mild almost anywhere else.  It makes Cholula seem like actual hot sauce, if that means anything to you.There isn't much else on the menu besides curries.  A few salads (no idea, didn't see any on the counter) and one or two desserts ("coffee jello", didn't try) but not much else.Service is terrifically friendly.  It's a cute little place but due to its size, not ideal for lingering.One thing I didn't try but should have: the lassi.  I have no idea what a Japanese-ish lassi would be, but I'm going to have to come back to find out.
David L.}New York, NY}4}80}0}-1}4}9/28/2013}Don't expect too much, but it is a solid place to go for  Western-Japanese comfort style food (gravy, cheese, fried food, ground beef).   The Yuba salad is excellent.  The space is tiny, so be prepared to wait sometimes.
Cheryl C.}Brooklyn, NY}32}3}2}-1}5}9/26/2013}A tiny spot offering only curry, can't go wrong with that! Honestly hooked on it and find myself there probably way too often (or not). As much as I've gone, I actually haven't tried all their menu offerings and they don't offer too much. Generally I get the Chicken Katsu Curry mild, plain and simple. Can't go wrong!
Sandra K.}Brooklyn, NY}1}67}0}-1}5}9/25/2013}I didn't know that food could taste so good. I've come back several times already and always order the beef dried curry. The space is cozy but everything is super cute and well laid out. I love that you can watch them prepare the food, and the service is excellent.The best time to go is right when they open for lunch on weekends, because it gets busier as time goes by. Make sure to bring cash - it's cash only.
Dylan M.}Brooklyn, NY}62}151}31}-1}4}9/4/2013}This is the only place I've been to for Japanese curry in NY, but this place is great. It's super small, so it can get crowded, especially when it's busy. They're food is super fresh since they're basically cooking all day. I'll watching them chop onions and all that stuff while I'm eating. I used to go to Curry House in LA all the time, but since moving to NY, Curry-Ya is my go-to curry joint.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}4}8/22/2013}- Tiny place next door to rai rai ken, seats about 15 or so.  All stool seating- CASH ONLY- Get the pork katsu curry or the chicken katsu curry, and get the curry HOT. (its not that bad)- Think of the dried curry dish as a curry chili, thicker more concentrated and meaty curry, also worth ordering on a cold/rainy day.- They deliver!- Great affordable and hearty meal
Robert N.}New York, NY}342}225}30}-1}4}8/10/2013}Place is rather small and cramped, probably doesn't seat any more than 10 people. But all I really care about is how the food tastes!I've had the mini pork katsu and chicken katsu for lunch once, and although it was good, it was small. Was definitely hungry afterwards.I came back for a second time after my friend suggested I try the grilled chicken with baked curry and egg. The combination of curry, cheese and egg was pretty darn good. One caveat though, was that the chicken tasted dated. It was not breaded, so the taste of the chicken was not masked. I'd come back only to try the baked curry with a deep fried protein.
Alison L.}New York, NY}144}140}11}-1}4}8/4/2013}I'm not a huuuge curry fan, but this place was great. I ordered the original plain curry (mild) and it was delicious. The texture of the curry was perfect, not to thin nor thick, and the amount of rice doesn't look like it'll be enough, but it's so packed. My friend got the dried curry and I think that I will be ordering that next time. I tried some and it was fantastic--and not to mention, tempura onions on top.Just like any other bar-style restaurant, space is tight; but it's totally worth it. I would go later in the evening to avoid a long wait and to enjoy some really great gourmet comfort food. A NY original.
Vicky L.}Jersey City, NJ}783}903}409}18}4}8/1/2013Updatedreview}I love this place.  I think it should be known now that I have a penchant for Japanese comfort food.  Pretty much give me anything delicious over a steaming bowl of rice and I'll love it.  This trip I tried the japanese curry over brown rice.  Could have more meat, but it wasn't like I didn't lick the bowl clean regardless.
Shirley Y.}San Francisco, CA}74}146}237}-1}4}7/26/2013}Food: I ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet with curry. It tasted better the first time I got it. It wasn't very hot, but the pork cutlet was still crispy and delicious drowned in curry. It's great that the curry is on the side and not on the plate so the pork doesn't get soggy. Atmosphere: Slightly small with limited seating. Service: They like to rush you to order and finish up even if the place is half empty.Price: Slightly pricey for what it is. It is also cash only. If you want more bang for your buck go to go go curry. For the same price you can get the grand slam and have pork & chicken cutlet, shrimp, sausage, and egg.
Cameron L.}Seattle, WA}0}147}167}-1}3}7/23/2013}Do not sit anywhere near the stove when its hot outside. Oh my goodness I should of sat near the window. The place is long an narrow so it was hard to move around people. This place is cash only. The curry was not that amazing and the portions were tiny tiny! A piece of pork katsu with a small bowl of rice and three tiny little pieces of string beans for decoration.... all for 16$ !! I was still kind of hungry after I left.
Emily M.}New York, NY}134}285}45}-1}3}7/19/2013}This place was so fun! I really felt like I was sitting at a lunch counter in Tokyo. I mean the food was an easy sell. I've never met a fried chicken cutlet I didn't want to marry. Serve it over sticky rice with curry sauce, and I'm completely sold. The reason I give it only 3 stars is that there isn't a lot of variety. I don't mean that there aren't a lot of options on the menu, I mean that all the options, are kind the same thing re-organized, or with a different protein. Also, we tried the seafood mix with curry, and the shrimp was nicely cooked, but the squid and scallops were definitely frozen, and kind of a throw-away.
Angie K.}Dallas, TX}340}752}122}18}4}7/14/2013}This is probably one of my favorite places to eat by myself. This small restaurant is bar seating only, and the pricing is appropriate.The Berkshire Pork Katsu is their most popular- It was freshly fried, but a little on the dry side. They give you your own stone bowl of curry, which comes bubbling from the stove. I also tried the Croquette- kind of like a samosa, but mostly a round ball of fried mashed potatoes. It was good, but I've had better. You can also get your curry baked- like au gratin, without the breadcrumbs. Preparation time takes longer since it needs to be in the oven, but it was delicious as well! The regular curry has a slight edge over the baked, for me, because I love being able to adjust the amount of curry on my rice.The only thing I hate is that this place is cash only. Otherwise, a solid 4-star joint.
Paul C.}New York, NY}250}98}68}-1}5}7/9/2013}i'm surprised myself that I'm giving this 5 stars, but here's my reasoning.oh, CASH ONLY.there is something charming about a clean, simple menu that does a few things right. And I believe curry-ya is one of those places. It conjures up the best memories of Tokyo - from ambience to quality of food.So to set this up, most people say L.A. has the best korean food in the world. Why? Because you combine American meat with Korean preparation. As a whole, you can get better quality meat in the USA for a lot cheaper than if you want to get top grade in most Asian countries.Use that same line of thinking for chicken/pork katsu, and that's what makes curry-ya great. Amazing chefs who take their passion for their craft from Japan and share it with the world in NYC, coupled with greater access to high grade meat and ingredients for cheaper (which means better quality meat than i was used to having with similar cooking style in Asia), prepared with care and pride.I do recommend the berkshire pork cutlet curry with quail egg yolk. simple yet as close to a perfect katsu that I've had.
Lukas W.}East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA}11}77}6}-1}5}7/8/2013Updatedreview}I've come back to curry-ya four or five times since first eating and I still love it. It's cute in its cramped space, and the food is simply great. And, as a little bonus: it probably has the coolest toilet in the east village. Seriously. (ticwashlet.com/washlet_e…)
Danny P.}New York, NY}766}178}43}-1}4}7/5/2013}This place takes curry chicken/pork katsu to another level! Although it is pricey for what it serves, the small meal was delicious! The pork katsu was crispy and cooked fresh. The curry came in a separate bowl which came with a big scooping spoon. What makes this place deliciously unique is the curry. It is quality curry and their curry dominates all of their competitors that serve curry chicken/pork katsu. The curry accompanies the rice and pork extremely well. It all came together like a masterpiece, every bite was bitter sweet- it is sweet because every bite was happiness, and it was bitter because every bite lead to there being less food. If there was just a little bit more food for the price, or if the price was lowered to match their serving sizes, then this place would be perfection!
Jennie A.}Brooklyn, NY}96}138}76}-1}4}7/2/2013}I've had curry in Tokyo & Kyoto & I thoroughly enjoy Curry-Ya.  It is rare that I eat sushi or sashimi here because Japan ruined them for me, but Curry-Ya curry is comparable.  I've had everything on the menu & have enjoyed all my meals.  My favorite curry is the dried beef curry.I would give it five stars except a staff member told my husband the curry sauce was vegetarian & the vegetable curry was vegetarian twice & we later learned the curry sauce has animal stock in it.
Carney Z.}Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY}12}8}0}-1}4}6/26/2013}Curry-ya was delicious however I thought it was overpriced by a dollar or two but that's no big deal. I ordered katsu curry. They gave me rice katsu and one bean sprout (LOL). You get to pour on the curry yourself and add in little things like dried onions and beni shoga yourself on the side. It's a little spot and definitely pretty cramped. Although small and cramp, I thought the coolest thing was how you could hook your clothes on the wall behind you and how you could stuff your bag in your chair.
Josh Q.}San Francisco, CA}33}414}0}-1}4}6/22/2013}Awesome food in a quaint little spot with mostly bar seating.  I never particularly liked Japanese curry until I tried this place, which turned me into a big fan.  I have tried and would surely recommend both the chicken and pork katsu curries.
Dennis L.}Redondo Beach, CA}288}504}84}-1}5}6/5/2013}CASH ONLY. Why?? Sometimes I never understand why a good restaurant will stifle their own business by stubbornly accepting cash only. The Japanese curry here is expertly made. That's pretty much all they make. From the Berkshire pork to the chicken katsu, all are delicious. They have unlimited fukujinzuke and fried onions as toppings. They even can bake your curry with cheese. After curiosity got me to order the baked version though, I think I'll stick with the regular curry.The lunch special isn't anything too crazy. You just get a side salad to go along with your curry. Itadakimasu!___April '13 Health Score - A
Christina C.}Houston, TX}54}123}24}-1}4}6/3/2013}Great curry! I'm a huge fan of Golden Curry (the japanese cubed/boxed instant curry you can buy at most Asian grocery stores), but non-instant curry is definitely better! There are various places in the city where they serve "Japanese curry" and it taste like the Golden curry I make a home, but the curry at Curry-ya tastes different! Good different. I do think they make their curry from scratch, and my favorite is the vegetable curry. I love the veggies and small pine mushrooms! FYI, I'm not a vegetarian. The pork katsu curry would be my next favorite. They also serve brown rice for those the health people out there!For those of you who can eat bowls and bowls of rice, the portions may be small for you. I can easily finish my rice and curry and definitely know that my husband would need an extra serving! The yuba salad here is also very tasty and they use asparagus which is great! Presentation and taste are great! A must try if you love tofu. ALSO... chikalicious is right next door for dessert. Get the red velvet cupcake. The strawberry shortcake w/the soft serve is also yummy!
Steph C.}Brooklyn, NY}468}752}318}18}4}6/3/2013}Great little spot. I went here to grab take-out, but I'd definitely go back to dine in!It's a tiny, narrow space, but very clean and comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and polite. The server poured me a glass of water to sip on while I waited for my take-out order. It's mostly counter seating, which would make it ideal to go solo to grab a tasty bite. I saw several patrons who were alone and comfortably eating and reading the paper/checking their phones while I was there. I got a couple orders of the Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry. Extremely generous portions in nice slotted to-go containers. The cutlet was delicious!  It survived the train ride and stayed warm and crispy throughout. The rice was more than I could finish. The curry was smooth and flavorful, although I like Katsu-hama  or GoGo curry a little bit better. It's cash only, luckily there's a Chase nearby. And for dessert, Chikalicious is only a few doors down!
Monica H.}Philadelphia, PA}98}183}585}18}4}5/18/2013}Yeyyyy!! I got to try it today and glad I got there a lil after it opened cuz it got packed pretty quickly! It's a small cute spot, the staff was friendly and it was quite comfy in there... We got the Dry Curry and Chcken Cutlet... It was DELCIOUS!!! Portion was great, I couldn't even finish mines! You definitely could tell the different texture and flavor between their medium and hot curry, unlike other places where it's just blah.. I'll be back to try additional items on their menu =)
Ydnew L.}Manhattan, NY}30}91}111}-1}4}5/17/2013}Dried Beef Curry is a must to order! U probably won't find something similar elsewhere.Their Dried Beef Curry is not your typical Japanese sweet curry. Don't bother to order their Berkshire pork cutlet. The meat is very thin and dry. Be prepared to wait as the shop is tiny and seats are very limited. (only counter seats)
Eduardo F.}Midtown East, Manhattan, NY}21}10}0}-1}3}5/14/2013}I feel there is a general rule for judging food such as curry, and that is if the kind you make at home from a box you bought at a Japanese grocery store tastes better than the curry at the restaurant you just had it at  for 5 times the price, then it should get a low rating. The menu states that the curry is a special blend made with oxtail and chicken soup, so I was expecting a party in my mouth.. however I was disappointed. Maybe it was the dish I ordered, Dry Curry, and the other flavors of the dish took away from the curry (I added natto to it as an extra topping), but I didn't leave the place with the feeling that I had just eaten at a curry specialists's kitchen. My friend had the hambaga curry and felt the same way, so I'm thinking perhaps it wasn't just my dish. The place is cute and cozy, but if you've got a curry crave, you're better off going to sunrise and buying the kind that comes in a box.. I wanted to like this place more, but the flavor just wan't there..
Judy L.}Denver, CO}119}682}85}18}4}5/13/2013}Delicious curry. The katsu was great. Perfectly fried. The meat was still juicy and not dried out. The classic one included cubed beef and other vegetables. Very delicious. The rice to curry portion was very well balanced. I liked that the curry was served separately from the rice. I could eat at my own paste without worrying about the curry congealing. The croquette was not bad, but not memorable. The texture was great though.
Ashley V.}Chicago, IL}145}61}7}-1}5}5/13/2013}One of my favorites in NYC. I've been here several times when I've visited and I loved it every time. Always hits the spot!You have to try the pork cutlet curry - it's so tender and crispy. Melts in yo mouth. The curry is not as spicy as I expected the first time I had it. So if you're usually a Mild-kind-of-gal/guy, I would step it up one notch for them. I love the add ons - I always get egg and croquette but I have to warn you, the pork cutlet curry is already a pretty hefty portion (i am just greedy). Downside is the place is tiny, so not great for big groups and also not great if you're going on the weekends for dinner. Highly encourage all of you to check this place out!
Edmond L.}Los Angeles, CA}20}52}0}-1}5}5/13/2013}Love it. Basically bar only seating, so there's limited space. I've had to wait a few times, but I've enjoyed it every time.
Timolin J.}Manhattan, NY}29}12}0}-1}2}5/12/2013}I've come to this restaurant for about five years and was most impressed with the quality of food and service but it has gone downhill recently and they've lost a customer. Initially having few staff (2 Mexican workers), they worked together like a well-oiled machine.  Now having 4 Japanese staff, they fidget about unsure of anything, look at orders puzzled and move like they've got all day, forgetting they've got hungry customers waiting. It took half an hour to get a simple (classic japanese curry) order correct and the portion served was smaller than usual. Moreover the worker (red headed one) was unapologetic about her mistakes and even argued with a customer about the lack of spice of his dish. I give it 2 stars because the food is still good but I won't be coming back until they've got a change of staff and better customer service.
Chang K.}New York, NY}0}39}2}-1}4}5/7/2013}Ordered Japanese Classic curry and donkatsu at this cute and cosy place.  Small and crowded but you know what is being served as the kitchen is right in front of you.  I highly recommend this place for Japanese curry!
Jason C.}Queens, NY}210}129}39}-1}5}5/4/2013}Curry-Ya is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city.  Their menu is very simple, quick and affordable.  Don't go there with a lot of people since there is very limited seating.  I'd go with one or two people max.  I try to order different stuff each time but you can never go wrong with the tonkatsu curry.  And don't forget to add an egg on top!Cash only.
William C.}Los Angeles, CA}309}107}5}-1}5}4/26/2013}Curry-Ya is my favorite restaurant in the city. Whenever a friend visits from home, I always bring them to Curry-Ya. You will never be disappointed (unless you just don't like curry). I order the pork cutlet curry, which is pricier than the other curries but is well worth it. The meat is tender, the curry is smooth and rich, and the quality of the rice is very good. Staff is friendly and the overall aesthetic of the restaurant is pleasant. There aren't an abundance of seats so try to avoid peak lunch and dinner times (but they do deliver!).Don't forget to bring cash!
Matt H.}Philadelphia, PA}6}16}1}-1}4}4/25/2013}Simple, delicious, and cost effective.  Pork katsu curry medium was fantastic, as were the traditional (potatoes, carrots, and beef) curry and unfiltered Japanese beer!
B L.}Flushing, NY}1}69}8}-1}3}4/24/2013}Tasted no different from the boxed Japanese curry I use at home but with less ingredients. Seafood curry was a disappointment. The katsu was okay. Croquettes were good. the fried items were not oily.... Love the cute little Staub pots.
Mei C.}Brooklyn, NY}482}321}563}18}3}4/22/2013}The place is small, but pretty clean. Price is above average for rice and curry topping. We were sitting at the bar stool counter, waitress was actually right in front of us at all times. Food made right in front of us, fast and quick. Took a sip of my bf's plum sake, not bad. Had the dried curry dish, too dry. The small condiments of toasted garlic pieces was cute. Yes, that was the word I was looking for "Cute," everything about this place was cute.
Nick B.}New York, NY}0}44}1}-1}4}4/22/2013}Berkshire pork cutlet curry is delicious. I've only ordered through Seamless, which has been a great experience. Generally takes ~45 minutes and comes in really nice to-go dishes. This pork cutlet curry comes with ~6-8oz. cutlet, breaded, with a cup or two of rice and a big dish of excellent curry sauce!
Andy G.}Manhattan, NY}144}89}36}-1}5}4/21/2013}You know how sometimes when you're in love with someone, everything about them, even their shortcomings and flaws, is perfect to you?I've met the love of my food life in Curry-Ya.I love its location just a short distance away from the foot traffic heavy St. Mark's. I love the inconspicuously distinctive, simple yet elegant sign adorning the entrance. I appreciate the unobtrusively friendly staff and the efficiency with which they manage their tiny kitchen space. I love the narrow countertop bar seating and how the small confines of the interior ironically limit both the conversational noise and crowding within the place. I love the "dry" curry and I order it every single time. It's remarkably consistently remarkable. From the first time I had it, it was like finding my food soulmate. It's the homemade meal that I knew existed but never had. Each spoonful is so comforting and flavor-filled that I take as small bites as possible to savor all the nuances. I leave not a single grain of rice on my plate because I love it so much. I've been to Curry-Ya with a friend or two. I often come by myself. I'm there when I'm happy. I'm there when I'm sad. I'll always keep coming back, and isn't that what love is all about?
Lucie T.}Yonkers, NY}260}435}2}-1}4}4/16/2013}So another Japanese place that has it all except space.  Maybe that's the deal with great Japanese places: Amazing food but you need to be size two to sit there.  I am ok with that .. I will run a few more blocks. Sit at counter - limited seating go early and do not go in a larger than 3 (even that can be trouble) group. You can go with anything on the menu and you will feel comforted by the food.  The kitchen in which to you will be staring into while you wait for your order is spotless, another Japanese thing.  Been twice, know I am going back. I think it should be on our list to go to, if you like good quality Japanese curry.
P H.}Grand Prairie, TX}2104}1595}4321}-1}5}4/15/2013}*CASH ONLY*Decor: 4.5/5-The bar seats about 14 with two more seats at the window-The bathroom has a Washlet! So fun to play with!Service: 4.5/5-Be prepared to wait a good 15 minutes for the baked curry to be prepared. It is worth it thought!-friendly with no attitude, quick serviceFood: 5/5-Baked curry with Berkshire katsu (additional cost) was just perfect. Good variety of protein: cheese, berkshire katsu and egg. It was baked perfectly as well. The rice wasn't hard and the cheese wasn't burnt. The amount of curry was also just right in saltiness and portion. -The curry tasted like it was seasoned moderately with black pepper-The serving size was just right to make you content but for those with a bottomless pit stomach
Victor H.}Bayside, Queens, NY}135}643}2881}18}3}4/6/2013}Ok place for Japanese food. Nothing outstanding for this restaurant. There are other better Japanese food restaurant around this area.
Danny N.}West Covina, CA}2279}1457}55400}18}5}4/4/2013}Must order your curry baked!!!
Ratesh C.}New York, NY}1}9}1}-1}4}4/1/2013}Been here loads of times. Casual, clean and friendly staff. I love the curry , if only i knew how to make this myself. Both the veggie curry and beef taste good. Go on your own or with a couple of friends. Space can be limited since it's setup like a bar-kitchen.  Cash only.
Tracy W.}New York, NY}113}119}243}-1}5}4/1/2013}How is this the first time I am discovering this?! Thanks to Stewart C, I'll probably make this place a monthly trip. Just by writing this review, I am salivating. The pork cutlet is fried to perfection- so crispy on the outside and so succulent on the inside. I can hear it crunching away as I cut it with my knife. They give you a mountain of white rice to go with your pot of boiling curry (your choice of mild, medium, hot). The only downside is they give you THREE tiny string beans-- not even whole ones. Really? You gotta tease people like that? This is probably the best Japanese curry place I've been to so far.This place is teeny tiny, like their string beans. It might be best to come at off peak hours because it gets so damn crowded. Cash only.
Sathana K.}Hillsboro, OR}75}24}70}-1}4}3/30/2013}Good place if you like Japanese curry. My usual are Seasonal vegetable curry with extra pork cutlet or Beef dried curry. They curry is flavorful with thick texture and a touch of sweetness as what a good Japanese curry should be.
Marcia W.}New York, NY}65}224}8}-1}3}3/27/2013}Always good the first time you have it, but after a while, the amount of substance in their curry seems lacking. $10-15 for a pot of curry with only a few slices of veggies? I'm going to opt to make my own next time.However, if you're looking to eat alone, this is definitely a place you can do so.
Valerie L.}New York, NY}164}335}8}18}4}3/24/2013}I came here twice this week because it was just that good. The first time I came here I ordered the classic curry with a mini berkshire pork cutlet for $4.50 more- it was the perfect portion for me because I don't like to eat too much meat. I like that Curry-Ya brings out the curry in a separate iron bowl so you can choose how much curry you want to put on your cutlet and rice instead of drowning it on your plate like Udon West. You also have the option of choosing mild/medium/hot for your curry :) The second time I came here I wasn't that hungry so I order just a croquette and yuba salad- croquette was ok, I think it would've wasted a lot better with curry... but the yuba salad was AMAZING. It's a tofu skin and green bean salad layered with parmesan cheese and drizzled with olive dressing. It tasted refreshing and not overwhelming. LIKEEEE. The restaurant itself is really small and has limited seating, staff are courteous but not friendly.
Rita L.}Manhattan, NY}1497}521}5346}18}4}3/22/2013}baked curry's great! I got the Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry baked and loved it! the place is so small they only have 15 seats and it gets filled so quickly! the wait's about 20 minute to get seats and another 20 min for the food, price could be a bit pricey for curry - about $18-20 but I think it's worth a try!
Justin Y.}Washington, DC}750}310}66}18}4}3/17/2013}Had to choose between 3 and 4, but I realized that I was being partial just because I'm not a huge fan of curry, so I decided to be kinder with my rating.I am from Southern California, a specific little town that's pretty much a spot of Japanese immigrants. That means I have tried tons of different Japanese sushi, ramen, and most importantly, curry spots. Curry-ya was delicious, but in my mind, it was on par with other restaurants that I had tried before only with a higher price tag.I ordered the Berkshire Pork Cutlet curry, despite it being $15. I love katsu and I wanted to see if this would fulfill my piggy needs. The cutlet was a wonderful piece of loin and perfectly fried! When they first put the plate down, it looked so dry, but once I took a bite, I could taste the juicy meat and the savory fat on the loin. If you don't like fatty meats, this may not be your best choice, but I love my meats fatty so this was an excellent surprise. The rice came in a football like oval and it was very good! I cook really crappy rice at home and was excited to be eating authentic sticky rice again. The curry sauce was also good, but nothing particularly delicious to salivate for. I took my time with the sauce, tasting it in small scoops to see if I could differentiate from the ones I ate back at home, and couldn't find anything special.My friends ordered the baked curry and the seafood curry, all of which looked delicious and I think they all liked it. The place is pretty small (maybe seats 15 max?) and I think it fills up pretty quickly so come quick! Because it's mostly just one long counter, it's not the best place to come with a group of people. (PS, Curry-Ya is a small restaurant with a white counter. My friend accidentally walked into Iron Sushi next door, sat down, and was confused when they gave her a sushi menu. Don't make the same mistake)
Peter K.}Manhattan, NY}432}602}58}18}4}3/5/2013}I can't believe they've been open for so long and I just now heard about them. This place is awesome. Their curry is great and very filling. I had the hamburg curry and the hamburger patty that came in the pot was substantial. I'm a pretty big guy too so you can believe me when I say something is filling. The rice was nice and fluffy. Not sure if you can substitute for brown rice for those that enjoy that sort of thing. I personally always eat curry with white rice just out of tradition. My friend had the tonkatsu which looked good. Their croquettes were also very nicely fried with a creamy center. This place is very small so I would recommend against coming here with a large group. The seating area is basically just the bar.The service is great. The people behind the counter are incredibly friendly and attentive.Prices are not too bad with most dishes costing around $10-14.
Abby S.}New York, NY}273}227}1}-1}4}3/1/2013}whats the best thing on a cold rainy day.. after ramen of course? japanese curry.just like any other japanese place, its small, dainty, super cute and streamlined. just one whole bar with an exposed kitchen where you can see the preciseness they put in making your dish. i had the traditional japanese curry,with squash, peppers, potatoes, and beef. the curry came in a dish that is shaped like alladin's lamp. the white rice in my plate was molded into some sort of shape i cant make out. i picked the medium for spicy-ness. the sauce was really rich and creamy. it was delicious. was not spicy enough though! the meat was tender and flavorful. my only complaint was that their servings are a little stingy with the meat. but i slurped every single drop of that curry with my rice. heaven. next time i will try the dry curry. it looked really intriguing. bonus: they have a super fancy bathroom with a bedet and all the works! use it when youre there. its fun!!!
Jonathan A.}New York, NY}141}272}99}-1}4}2/28/2013}Soooooo good...the baked curry is amazing...curry and cheese baked over rice you really cant go wrong...but generally they have the best Japanese curry ive tasted. Cheap and delicious very cute small place. If you go during a typical dinner time plan on a wait because the seating is limited but worth the wait.
Michael C.}Manhattan, NY}74}926}236}18}4}2/28/2013}Great Japanese curry! Reasonably priced, and surprisingly, not a terrible wait on a weekend night.The rice was cooked just right, with the appropriate texture, and more importantly, the curries were spot on. Between the three of us, we got the dry curry, tonkatsu and the regular curry. All were tasty.Curry-Ya has some of the best curry I've tried in NYC. It's a step up from the hole-in-the-wall Go Go Curry (although Go Go is admittedly butt cheap).
Liv L.}New York, NY}108}41}36}-1}4}2/24/2013}When Japanese curry is liked by a California native, the land of Americanized Asian foods closest to the motherland, you know the food's done right.  My guest has told me twice now that she can't stop thinking about that curry she tried in NYC.Aside from that, we who live in NYC had such a great meal that we went back twice within the same week.  Excellent!  And the cherry on top: great, friendly service.Cash only.
Karl K.}San Francisco, CA}0}240}16}-1}5}2/23/2013}Great place! Love the beer selection, love the curry. We didn't like the baked curry so much, but stick to the traditional Japanese curries and you can't go wrong.
Hieu P.}Brooklyn, NY}118}24}18}-1}5}2/23/2013}IN SHORT:A curry dish + a glass of plum wine = happy camperCASH ONLY----------FULL REVIEW:I don't understand why I have not discovered this place sooner. This place is where I can get Japanese comfort food, hands down! My friend and I stopped by this joint on a really cold February night after we were told of our 3-hour wait at Ippudo and 90-minute wait at Momofuku Noodle Bar. The silver lining of such a long wait period is us discovering this place, somewhat equidistant from both ramen joints. For our party of two we ordered a baked Japanese classic curry and the Berkshire pork cutlet curry, and I got a glass of plum wine (which really began my love for this beverage). I don't think you can go wrong with any curry dish. They also have some garnishes on the counter that you can add to your curry (dried spring onion flakes, pickled Japanese scallion ( rakkyō), and red relish. I love the service and the Japanese politeness of the host. The joint sits at most 12-14 people at a time, and despite what other reviewers have said I like the coziness of the place. You come in and just grab any seat available, hang your coat on the hangers provided, and sit just like you would at a bar and order away. And you can see how your curry is cooked. This can be a good place to catch up with a friend and lounge just a tiny bit if you pace yourself with your food.In my recent memory, this curry joint is in my top two restaurants. It's good comfort food that makes you feel good when you leave.
John H.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}4}2/17/2013}Go into the restaurant and grab your own seats...if you are lucky enough not to be waiting on the line that is. I did not have to wait on the line because went to this restaurant around 3pm.This place delivers Japanese-style curry and puts unique twist to bring the dishes to another level. I ordered "dry" curry (for its name's sake, I must clarify that it is NOT literally dried curry powder), and my partner ordered baked Japanese classic curry. You can modify any type of your curry dishes to be baked, meaning that they will add a layer of cheese on top to look like Italian lasagna or some sort. The taste for both dishes was amazing and $3 croquette was another surprise element that I would recommend people to try. All foods were well-seasoned and spiced to my liking (i.e., not too salty; not too blend). One criticism I have about the restaurant....communication between servers and guests. I understand that the servers are Japanese and all, but they gave me another order of rice when I actually asked for a knife. Overall, a great restaurant with delicious Japanese-style curry. I recommend!
Julie S.}Manhattan, NY}7}190}198}-1}4}2/15/2013}Brought my boyfriend here because he loves Japanese curry. Limited seating it's bar style where you can see them cook. The service was good. They greet you in Japanese when you enter. Menu is all curry. Boyfriend got chicken katsu curry. Sauce comes fresh in a clay pot. I got the yuba salad. It was surprisingly good. It's not a garden leafy salad. It was an arrangement of green beans and tofu skins stacked on top of each other with parm. cheese and this delicious olive dressing  YUM. very tight space so don't come in groups. The stools has a cubby in the front to put your purse, and you can hang your jacket on the wall. I'm not a fan of japanese curry so I thought the sauce was okay. But he devoured it. Cons: Cash only
Rachel C.}New York, NY}23}11}11}-1}5}2/2/2013}Amazing Japanese curry, probably one of the best I've ever eaten. Try it extra spicy!
Michelle Y.}Manhattan, NY}103}37}9}-1}5}1/23/2013}If you like Japanese curry, you will LOVE this place. I personally prefer it over Go Go Curry, my lunch spot of choice when I want to end up with severe food coma.Tucked away in the East Village, this place is like most other little restaurants in that area - great food, cash only, limited seating. My friends and I came on a weekday evening around 6:30 PM but there wasn't much of a wait before we were seated at the counter. I ordered the Berkshire Curry because it was labeled as their specialty and I was not disappointed. The katsu was crunchy and savory and the curry flavorful without being too heavy. I was in curry heaven for a good 20 minutes as I enjoyed my meal. I'm definitely going back and definitely going to try other items on the menu next time. Highly recommended for anyone who's into Japanese curry!Word of advice, like most Japanese places, don't go with a large group because seating is in small tables and at the counter.
Jae C.}Manhattan, NY}145}237}2}-1}4}1/16/2013}Ah, that berkshire pork cutlet with a little bit of curry. I like coming here for good katsu as the service is quick and the interior is friendly and clean. However, the counter top seating is on the cramped side and you'll probably be seated next to others who will overhear everything you say and vice-versa. I can't speak to the other items on the menu as I only get the pork cutlet w/ curry. You can specify how spicy you'd like the curry to be. I opt for medium usually and it has enough heat but not to the point of annoyance. On the expensive side but the quality is worth it.
Lindsey S.}Manhattan, NY}227}115}164}-1}5}1/16/2013}Pros: awesome curry!!!!Cons: cash only, tiny placeTip: Add $4 (I think?) and have it BAKED! SOOOOO GOOOD!!! Trust me and go ahead with this option! (It's described at the back of the menu.)OMG! I looooooooove the curry here!!!  It's so hearty, hot, and gives you that warm gratifying "ummmmmmmm" feeling in ur stomach; it's a good thing! So, on cold Winter night in the city, you know you want this! * BAKED birkshire pork cutlet: it came in a cute mini Staub iron pot with a beautifully cooked quail egg on top of curry. It was just a cheesy, gooey, currylicious goodness!!!! So, they layer the pork cutlet on a bed of rice that's at the bottom and put curry sauce, sprinkle shredded mozarella cheese, and a quail egg and finish off by melting the cheese in the oven. SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD!* Mini Croquette: it's a deep fried potatoey little square pocket. I would pass this one next time... AND, I concur with Kevin's review below about the peas on the plate as decoration. Curry ya people, pls reconsider putting these on plate; it does not serve any purposes.The seating is literally just the counter top, so you will be sitting next to each other, period.
S L.}Washington, DC}5}29}6}-1}5}1/12/2013}Yummiest curry! Got delivery and Curry Ya was very accomodating :)I love the one with the ground beef. Really good prices for lunch
Virginia Y.}San Francisco, CA}1590}1444}4566}18}5}1/11/2013}Thank goodness the place wasn't packed when I came. I love the white interior here. It's a very cozy and intimate setting. You can hang your coats up on the hangers on the wall. The seating is in genius. There's actually a cubby section where you can store your bag underneath the wooden stools. Anyways, on to the food..The dishes are nice and simple, curry with various toppings. You can order egg or veggies, etc. etc. I recommend their best dish, berkshire pork cutlet. I ordered the original curry with a mini berkshire pork cutlet. The order was made quickly and the curry was very flavorful. I liked that it wasn't as greasy as go go curry. The atmosphere here is much better. I remember eating at go go curry, the place felt so filthy and gross and it felt like a hole in a wall. Curry Ya is kind of like that but it's much classier and cleaner. The dish doesn't feel like fast food, where at go go curry, it did. Aside from the toppings you can order on the menu, they also have onions, pickled radishes and onion flakes on the side for you to add at your own leisure. This would be a great place for a date or a quiet dinner on your own.
Win L.}Manhattan, NY}58}43}29}-1}4}1/9/2013}I knew the wait was going to be long when I walked in and not one person had food in front of them almost like everyone came in at the same time - good thing I wasn't too hungry.This place is the epitome of a NY hole in the wall restaurant - you eat at the counter and the other side of the counter is the kitchen. The staff practically climb over each other every 5 minutes but regardless of the lack of space they serve a mean bowl of Japanese curry! I ordered take out but while I was waiting for my food, standing awkwardly between tables of customers getting their food, I could see the curry was served on the side and varying levels of spiciness was offered which is nice because I like to customize. Everything looked so good and when I finally got home to try mine, I got the classic japanese curry, I became an instant fan! Definitely will be coming back and try the Berkshire pork!
Jenny S.}Pasadena, CA}2064}2481}6739}18}3}1/3/2013}JAPANESE CURRY plain & simpleused seamless to order a pick-up order!!---Berkshire pork cutlet w/ curry (comes w/ rice, ginger, & some green beans): the curry was not bad & the pork cutlet was fried crispy.. but a bit BLAND... my favorite pork cutlet in NYC still has to be Katsu-Hama!!NOTE: all counter seating inside this stark white restaurant!
Jaszon S.}Westchester County, NY}956}224}182}-1}3}1/2/2013}Anyone who knows that Japanese food is much more than sushi and teriyaki chicken knows how important curry dishes are...  It's like Japanese soul food, and not much beats a bowl of rice topped with curry.I ordered the pork cutlet & medium spicy curry.  The plate came out with a small scoop of rice, a small fried pork cutlet, and curry served in a gravy boat.  There were also three pieces of green beans (yes, three small pieces.)  I assume the three pieces were meant to be a mediocre attempt at garnish?  Anyway, everything was decent in spite of the pork cutlet being slightly overcooked.  I look forward to trying more dishes in the future.
Susan L.}Manhattan, NY}313}420}670}18}5}12/31/2012}Even though this place is small, the food are amazing. The berkshire pork cutlet curry was crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. It was definitely really good. The lychee yogurt drink was pre-made but it was still good and it helped with the spiciness from the curry. I will surely come back here again.
Alice Y.}Brooklyn, NY}14}68}7}-1}4}12/31/2012}Pretty good curry. I like the beef curry over rice. Very satisfying. My friends ordered other stuff which I can't recall, and after they tasted my food, they were kind enough to lick my plate clean for me when I got full. 4 stars because it's not good nuff to lure me back. Idk why. But when I crave curry, I prefer to go with my other options. Aka Go Go Curry by NYU.
Yan L.}Washington, DC}0}160}1}-1}3}12/26/2012}Curry was good (sweet and tasty) and thoughtfully served in a cast iron pot, but not good enough to rave about. It tastes similar to the curry I make at home using the roux cubes - nothing special. The katsu pork cutlet was just okay - couldn't taste what was so special about it. Plain Lassi was nice addition to the spicy meal - cool and relaxing to the taste buds. Cramped space reminds me of real restaurants in Japan, adds a nice touch.
Wesley H.}Brooklyn, NY}15}295}0}-1}4}12/13/2012}A cute little Japanese place with maybe a dozen seats on a counter surrounding the kitchen. The service is friendly and it succeeds in having the feel of another gem hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The curry was very good and comes out in small pots. The rice and whatever sides you order, such as pork cutlets or shrimp, come out on a separate dish. Honestly, I didn't have any gripes about the food. This is the perfect place for a warm Japanese curry on a cold day!One suggestion I have is that you get the extra spicy if you like spicy food. The level of  spiciness is quite low.
Nate M.}Dallas, TX}29}31}1}-1}4}12/11/2012}Tiny counter tables and warm curry are perfectly suited nostalgic reminders of actual curry restaurants in Japan.  We stopped in for a quick lunch and had some chicken cutlet curry.  If you have never had the pleasure of sampling Japanese curry in its home country, Curry-Ya's rendition is a perfectly adequate substitute.  If you like spicy foods, don't be afraid to get the Hot version of the curry sauce; we got Medium and while it has a bit of heat, it was nothing overwhelming.Overall, great little place we would definitely make a point of returning to.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}11/24/2012}Curry-Ya serves authentic Japanese curry with a variety of toppings to choose from. I got their Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry (medium spicy level) and my friend got Classic Japanese Curry. I really like the curry itself: it has a good combination of sweet and spicy flavor and it was neither too thick nor thin. The pork cutlet, however, was a bit disappointing. The meat was too tendon-y and overly chewy, so I had to eat each piece in one bite. I know I shouldn't expect them to serve Katsu Hama level pork cutlet since it is meant to be just a topping, not the main dish, but it was still a bit of let down. My friend's Classic Japanese Curry, served with veggies and beef cubes, was delicious as well.The place is tiny and gets really cramped during peak hours, but the staff is always friendly and polite. I will return to try their Beef Dried Curry and Seafood Curry in the future.
Jia Y.}Brooklyn, NY}17}53}15}-1}4}11/24/2012}I had the port cutlet and lychee drink, both are very good.
Rey B.}San Francisco, CA}77}42}6}-1}4}11/18/2012}Oh gosh, what a delight!! I love this place! Best japanese curry in NYC! Food is very generously proportioned, and you get to pick your add ons too! You also get to choose your spicy level, mild, medium and hot - which I know is a win-win for curryphobes! I would definitely recommend the dry beef curry, with a hard boiled egg and a potato croquette on the side! lots of carbs, I know, but you just have to try this combination. I have also had the seafood curry, which is also very good.The chicken cutlet is something I would not recommend because, every time I get it, I am reminded of how oily it is. It can be skipped, in my opinion.If you having a Japanese curry crave, do try out this place!P.S. - Cash only.
Kimberly H.}Fayetteville, NC}118}167}0}-1}5}11/12/2012}I do love my Japanese curry! This little shop does it perfectly. Curry-Ya is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant located in an area heavy in Japanese fare. Seating is restricted to one bar that surrounds the kitchen area of the shop. In other words, not the best place for big groups, but perfect for you and one other person. You can choose the level of spiciness of your curry here, which varies from mild to hot. My preference is usually for medium, though I sometimes crave hot as well. I feel that "mild" tastes less like curry and more like stew. My favorite dish here is the Berkshire pork cutlet curry. You get a breaded donkatsu cutlet atop your meal, which adds a lot more variety in taste and texture to the curry and rice combination. If you have a smaller appetite, you can also get a mini pork cutlet along with your plain curry for cheaper. Try to get in around happy hour, from 4 to 7PM every day, to get 50% off drinks. A must if you prefer enjoying your curry with a big, cold beer.One downside: cash only, so plan accordingly.
Ranu R.}New York, NY}155}246}33}-1}4}11/7/2012}YUM! When the curry craving hits and you don't feel like making it from pre-purchased curry cubes at home (which is what I do, don't judge me), Curry-Ya should be your spot. Staff is friendly, prices are reasonable and the curry was hearty and deliciousI stopped in for lunch yesterday and got the Berkshire Pork Curry. Holy crispy pork cutlet. So rich and delicious. Coupled with a mound of white rice (yes, I ate all of it) and a curry boat (yup, a boat!), it was the perfect hearty meal after being outside for an hour.Also, the salad dressing on the salad was some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly zesty and vinegar-y and very refreshing.Total including tip was around $16. Not the cheapest, but for high quality pork and curry, a great atmosphere and the ensuing happy feeling in my belly, I'll take it. Will definitely be back when the Japanese curry craving hits.
Eric S.}Flushing, NY}232}98}0}-1}4}11/6/2012}Its like a curry bar...only counter top space..so not group friendly...and to get to the bathroom you have to squeeze by everyone sitting at the counter...I'm kinda fat, so yea that sucked..but the food was good. The first thing I noticed was how well the Pork Katsu was fried. Seriously, perfect. Crispy, and juicy and all that good stuff. GF had the veggie curry which was good also, accidentally found the place, but glad we did.
Raimondo P.}Beverly Hills, CA}0}10}0}-1}5}11/5/2012}Best curry place. Ever. If you go here you have to try the chicken katsu. So crispy and flavorful. Add vegetables too. Great atmosphere and quick/friendly service too. Only downside: cash only. So save some cash up and eat warm curry!
Matt P.}Mountain View, CA}73}33}27}-1}4}10/30/2012}Curry-Ya was one of my favorite go-to places in the city.  It's small and narrow, but ultimately cozy, as seating is entirely arranged around the bar, and the chefs cook right before your eyes.  I've gone there many a cold winter's day / night to warm up with a some spicy curry :)I ordered several dishes there, but would say that my favorite is to get the set menu, which comes with a salad, a main, and dessert.For the main, I'd frequently get the pork katsu curry combination.  The katsu is not the largest I've had in the past, but was decent enough size, and more importantly, tasted quite good.  The curry in my opinion has just the right consistency and thickness, and they can adjust the spiciness to taste.Dessert was always a treat as well --- Japanese panna cotta w/ a berry jam layer and a lsmall eaf of mint.  A simple but nice finishing touch to a meal. A random side note: the restaurant serves one of my favorite, but unfortunately hard to find Japanese beers (Ginga-kogen); a bit pricey, but I strongly recommend it.
Dust B.}New York, NY}63}57}2}-1}3}10/28/2012}Mooooooooo! While quite tasty, portions are small even by human being standards. Price is also up there by human currency standards. Curry ya will lose me along with the rest of the heiffer demographic to gogocurry unless they create a better value.
Lin H.}New York, NY}75}255}2}-1}4}10/27/2012}Perfect rice and the curry had great flavor and depth. Still craving it again after having dinner last week.
Joyce X.}Queens, NY}3}33}24}-1}4}10/27/2012}I ordered the curry chicken thigh rice which tasted delicious..I guess I will stop by again becasue there are still a lot of food in the menu which I haven't tried yet..
Sandy L.}Hong Kong}84}11}2}-1}4}10/13/2012}The restaurant is small enough to expect for at least a 10 min wait. Freshly made for every order, fast service, decent food. I will recommend the seaweed salad to build up your appetite for some mild curry
Julianne B.}Los Angeles, CA}82}300}37}-1}4}10/2/2012}love curry-ya for lunch. today i had the japanese classic (beef and veg's) and added a  mini chicken cutlet. i think this was my best order yet. if you go for lunch service is super fast. you can be in and out in about 30 minutes.  filling and delicious :)
Qian W.}Queens, NY}326}350}61}-1}3}9/29/2012}A very intimate little place with around 15 seats total in a bar formation. I came here twice, about a year apart, both times getting the berkshire pork, which was really good. They used to serve rice in a donut shape so you can pour curry in the hole but the second time I went there they just give you a lump of unshapped rice. My friends who went after me never got the donut.They serve solid Japanese curry but being a specialized curry house and carrying the word 'curry' in their name, I definitely expected better. The place is very tidy and clean and you get to watch the girls make your curry so it is a novelty experience. But if you are a serious curry eater and isn't targeting a specific dining experience, this place is okay to skip.
Panda C.}Brooklyn, NY}16}36}0}-1}3}9/17/2012}The rice was amazing~~  I didn't enjoy the curry because it had too much starch, but otherwise very good environment.  It was very clean and you get to watch them cook in front of you!
Alexander M.}New York, NY}183}417}26}-1}4}9/5/2012}I guess my only gripes with Curry-Ya are the same as everyone else's: limited seating and cash only. Despite the fact that Japanese curry is less and less difficult to hunt down in NYC these days, Curry-Ya's is, if not the best, the best-served. You mainly choose between veggie, pork cutlet, and beef curries. My friend and I decided to try one each of the beef and pork. The pork comes dry with a side of rice and the curry in a hot pot also on the side. The beef comes with the rice already smothered in the stuff. Both are great in their own way. It seemed like every other diner was getting this cool-looking green salad...so that must be good. Japanese beers, both popular and obscure, also available. The service is efficient and respectful. Solid Japanese curry in the EV served in sleek, Tokyo-sized digs.
Ally W.}Manhattan, NY}23}70}13}-1}3}9/2/2012}I passed by this place many times and it was always packed. I was in the neighborhood this afternoon around 3pm, walked by and decided to give this place a try. They serve Japanese curry here. I ordered the berkshire pork cutlet curry or aka pork katsu curry. The meat was well-done, the sauce was flavorful, but....I guess a katsu is a katsu, it's hard to make it taste heavenly. And the price... I think $13 for pork katsu and curry is not too bad for NY standard, but I'm used to pay $ 8-9 for similar dishes when I was living in SF. PS. This place is tiny, only fits 10 people or so. The service was good, friendly staff. Oh, and it is cash only.
Chester N.}Astoria, NY}121}174}1}-1}4}8/30/2012}It's been a few years between visits here.  Since my first couple visits, this website called Yelp.com exploded in popularity and now I'm able to write a review.To begin, the best time to come here is when no one else is here.  An obvious observation, so to be more specific, after 8pm for dinner.  It's first come, first serve, and seating is limited.  It can be very tricky if you arrive with a group larger than 3 and expect to be seated together.  Essentially it's a bar surrounding the kitchen with approximately 15 stools.  When a stool is available, you are free to take it if you're in the front of the line lest you give it up to wait for another.  However, the wait can be worth it.  It's difficult to judge whether or not a wait is worth the price of admission.  For example, I would not wait more than 5 minutes for McDonald's, but I have waited an hour for Raine's Law Room.  Curry-Ya falls in between and I would estimate a wait time of 20 minutes would be my limit.  Luckily the stool turnover time is rather quick unless a couple old friends want to catch up on your time while you wait.The curry is exactly what it should be.  Smooth and rich.  The Berkshire pork, and seafood are always a perfect call.  You can pick the spiciness of your curry.  The spiciest still isn't spicy, but it has enough of a kick to know they put some spice in.  A hands down favorite, now if only they can do something about that "Cash Only" rule.
Erica C.}Queens, NY}69}112}389}-1}4}8/29/2012}Came here twice and during both occasions, it wasn't crowded. You will immediately notice that they have fresh flowers as table decoration which adds a nice touch to the environment I asked for mild curry, and that's what I got. I can't handle spicy foods anymore so I appreciated how it didn't taste spicy to me at all.go have CURRY....YAA?
Steve N.}New York, NY}96}562}22}18}5}8/17/2012}Curry-Ya got us with the Yuba salad. Imagine a Jenga tower made of green beans with the layers separated by tofu skins. Everything that followed, the experience, the value, the food, the setting, the other diners, set a new bar for me for Japanese curry. The space seats fifteen'; most at the counter at stools facing the kitchen, and two more in the window with stools and a counter. The space is clean, white, and used with efficiency. We had a seafood curry with a croquetto and fried shrimp; a Berkshire pork cutlet curry with "additional vegetable;" and a Lassi beverage; $54 with tip. Our curry was medium. BONUS: A super-luxury Japanese commode awaits you in the restroom. You might be extra-super tidy following a restroom visit.TIP: Cash only! Call ahead! There's only 15 seats!
Sunny S.}Brooklyn, NY}143}42}6}-1}5}8/17/2012}Yum! This place always hits the spot when I'm craving Japanese curry. Unlike a lot of other popular yet small venues in St. Marks, I've never had to wait more than 10/15 minutes to get seated here. So if you want to get that bowl of Ippudo ramen but do not have the patience to wait 2+ ridiculously long hours, come here, enjoy curry, and be satisfied in less than an hour! I'm pretty stingy with 5 stars usually but I cannot think of any reasons to take off any stars here! Friendly staffs, great food, minimal wait, what more can you really as for? I would recommend the Berkshire Pork Cutlet, the original, and the dried beef. Ask them for baked if you want a little extra egg and cheese :). I'm also a fan of their lassi, reminds me of those asian yogurt drinks. *Tip: try those picked red radish (Fukujinzuke) with your curry!
Maggie L.}Madrid, Spain}21}20}8}-1}5}8/7/2012}It's always tough deciding what to order here since everything is so damn good. Love the Dried Beef Curry, the first dish I tried. The presentation itself makes it feel special. A generous mound of rice, smothered in ground beef curriness, topped with sliced eggs and a sprinkling of fried shallots.The Vegetable Curry is sweet, creamy, and still has a spicy kick. Meat fix? How about adding a hot, golden Pork Katsu to that? Yep you can do that! Then there's the Baked Curry. They'll take any curry dish, add cheese & an egg, and throw it in the oven. It's a bit longer of a wait, but this bubbling pot of yum is oh so worth it, especially come winter. Service is always wonderful, professional. The place is clean and comfortable, despite the small space.
Vivian L.}San Francisco, CA}142}312}22}18}4}8/5/2012}I've wanted to try this place for a long time (being a big fan of curry) and I'm glad I finally did! I ordered the dried beef curry and a Calpico drink. Sooo good and so satisfying. The curry is perfect, so flavorful and so hearty, great as comfort food. Be warned that the place is tiny so you might want to come right when it opens (which is what I did). You'll be seated right up against the kitchen in stools so you can see all the action as your food is prepared in front of you =). Cash only so come prepared!
Eva D.}Brooklyn, NY}96}31}0}-1}4}8/3/2012}I absolutely loved it there. It's a cozy little place to eat good curry. After I went there for the first time, I'm compelled to go there again! I tried their tonkatsu curry... and I love it. I'm going back there again soon! I'm definitely going to try out everything on their menu and definitely their desserts too.And I loved the bathroom... hahaha. If anyone was ever in there... You'll be pleasantly surprised!
Eve Z.}Brooklyn, NY}183}32}24}-1}5}8/2/2012}I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I'm determined to go through their menu. The place is small, cash only, but extremely good. I've had their hamburger curry, beef dried curry, and the classic (w/ corn). I haven't been disappointed yet and I don't think I will be. The portions are perfect and I absolutely adore the way they plate things. My friend ordered the Berkshire curry today and mentioned that the pork was nicely breaded, but not seasoned. In fact, she preferred it unseasoned because if the curry balanced it nicely. Otherwise, it would've been way too salty. Needless to say, I'll be back.
Ken T.}Staten Island, NY}5}13}11}-1}4}7/24/2012}Curry here is excellent and the dining atmosphere is much better than other curry houses. Usually I am torn between gogo curry and this place because I like them both, but this place win out on cleaniness, decor, and food presentation. My wife is willing to dine with me here and not gogo curry or other spots. While curry is probably not first choice for date night, curry-ya can make it work.You must try the pork cutley curry if you eat here, you will not regret it!
Marina C.}East Elmhurst, NY}129}467}156}18}3}7/23/2012}3.5 starsDined at Curry-ya two weeks ago, the place is really small. I ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet, while L had the Seafood Curry. The Berkshire pork was fried nicely, crispy, great texture. The portions are small, so if you have a big appetite, don't get the seafood curry. The seafood was fresh and tasty, but I had to give half my food to L. He was starving! Though he wouldn't have minded the portions, if we didn't see some of the employees eating their lunches; their portions were 2-3x as much. =X Regardless, it was our first time having Japanese curry and we found it to be a bit sweet and not very spicy, I should've ordered mine "hot".Overall, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. I did enjoy my meal, but it's not something I can't replicate at home. I'll probably dine at Go-Go Curry once just to compare the two, but somehow I doubt I'll like it. At least Curry-ya seems to use high quality ingredients. ---L was craving for some Japanese curry this week, so we bought all the ingredients and I made a whole pot of curry beef stew today. It was just as good and I didn't have to spend $40! I hope he likes it when he comes home from work...
D W.}New York, NY}0}56}0}-1}3}7/23/2012}I had the hayashi beef and it was lacking. The flavor of the sauce was good but the ingredients were subpar. I think they used canned mushrooms and the beef was the  type that is used in philly cheese steaks. The kind that is flattened and chopped up on the grill. It's not good for hayashi beef. It's just cheap.My dining companion had the traditional curry and the sauce was tasty. She had chunks of beef that looked quite tasty but I didn't try them. I'll go back to Curry-Ya but I won't have the hayashi beef.
Ray Y.}Astoria, Queens, NY}379}164}64}-1}3}7/18/2012}My cousin and I decided to try Curry-Ya during her last visit to the city.  We had been eating all day, so we decided to split a dish.  My cousin picked the Japanese classic (with beef, potato, carrot, pumpkin) and decided to spice it up by asking for baked style with cheese!  I thought the dish was okay.  In my opinion, it was too much rice and not enough sauce and fillings.  Also I wasn't a fan of the cheese - made my stomach angry when I got home.  Nothing too spectacular.  However, I'm not ready to give up on Curry-Ya just yet.  Everyone seems to love this place, so I'm willing to give this place another try.  Perhaps I'll go for the seafood curry next time, or the tonkatsu and chicken cutlet...
Mark R.}Manhattan, NY}0}16}0}-1}4}7/17/2012}This curry is sooo good.  Rich and spicy. Doubt Japanese curry could be any better.  My Japanese friend introduced me to Curry Ya a couple of years ago. Have been here several times and never disappointed. Good prices too.
Mika R.}Manhattan, NY}5}14}0}-1}5}7/14/2012}I have to say, for the prices they are asking, the food definitely is worth it!I came here today for a lunch date with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by how good the Hamburg Curry was.It looked like small portions, but don't be fooled. They give you a hot pot full of curry sauce, and even a little dish on the counter for pickled radishes to put on your own place.I am a big fan of small diners. It was a very quiet and chill atmosphere. You can just eat without being bothered by loud customers or the staff hanging around, asking if you need anything else.I recommend this place. I also tried the Yuba and Seaweed salad. Both were amazing, and under $8!!
M. W.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}4}26}8}-1}5}7/2/2012}You know what it's like when you get a Japanese curry craving. And this is the place to take care of that hunger...Just make sure you bring cash (cash only-- there is a Chase ATM down the street on the way on 2nd Ave)The Beef Dried Curry ($9) is delicious comfort food with the sweetness of raisins and saltiness of the beef (not spicy). The seafood curry is a tender combination of shrimp, squid, and scallops ($12) making it well worth it. The pork ($13) and chicken ($12) cutlets are made fresh and panko-crunchy + mouth-watering juicy.Some notable sides are the homemade croquettes, but if you want some extra vegetables on the side, it's well worth it (especially if you got the chicken or pork cutlet) and comes in a separate little iron curry sauce bowl ($3) e and while the corn is a little pricey ($1 extra, not fresh corn) it does fill that craving when you need it. And if you need a little extra cutlet, there is even a mini chicken ($3.5) or pork ($4) cutlet.If you're still craving a little greens and a cold starter, try the yuza salad with thin tofu skin and long green beans-- simple, but perfect for the summer.Take-out is easy with Seamless from this location, but the cutlet's don't survive as well and the proportions seem to be less enticing without the hot iron bowl containers, but is easy to re-microwave.Clean, narrow but clean furnishings and design with all seating at counter style. Would be difficult for large parties (since all facing one direction except for the few corner seats. Excellent spot for lunch or dinner alone or for a simple light/casual date. Noise level is fair and there are a few beers available as well.
Candice L.}Providence, RI}1}3}0}-1}4}6/26/2012}The curry is so delicious I would lick the plate if I could do it inconspicuously, which I can't because the place is so small, I'm always in danger of not being able to squeeze through to the bathroom if I eat too much. I've tried the Hamburger curry and Dried Beef curry, both of which were excellent. I was apprehensive about the raisins in the Dried Beef Curry but they actually work really well in complementing the spiciness of the curry. I've never had the budget for the Berkshire pork katsu, but I tried some of my friend's and loved it. Another important element of the curry that they get right is the high-grade japanese rice, tasty in its own right. Go at happy hour when the drinks are half off to try the soy milk and sake mix, or the beer brewed with soba. And if possible, go with a friend with a small apetite, so that you can finish their leftovers--the helpings are pretty big, but I'm always left wanting just a tad more.
Edward L.}Manhattan, NY}208}52}0}-1}4}6/18/2012}Food - 8/10Service - 7/10Atmosphere - 7/10Very good curry. Unfortunately a pretty limited seating capacity. Contemporary interior design, quick service.Recommend: Baked Curry, Pork Cutlet Curry, Beef Dried Curry.
Billy L.}New York, NY}0}4}0}-1}3}6/18/2012}This place is Okay.  Not the best.  Environment is small and unique, Service is fairly well because there is only 10 seats, friendly staff.  Lets get down to the taste, coming from GO-GO Curry, the curry from curry-ya is a little bland.  It tasted kind of watered down.  I would take a trip to GOGO curry instead.  It'll be more enjoyable.  But GOGO's selection is not as large as Curry-ya's.
Susan C.}New York, NY}210}83}20}-1}2}5/27/2012}honestly i dont understand the whole hype with this place. it tastes EXACTLY like the japanese boxed up curry they sell at asian supermarkets. i went here yest with high expectations after reading the reviews and left v disappointed.
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}4}5/16/2012}curry ya in EV.i always get the berkshire pork cutlet curry with corn and a side salad. i get the extra hot curry sauce. it is good, but i will say not every dish here is good. stick with the cutlet curries and all will be fine. i think they have the coco curry concept [from japan] but have not quite perfected it yet.
Jason N.}New York, NY}38}29}19}-1}4}5/15/2012}There's always something about sitting near the awesome individuals that cook your food that make the meal taste so much better. Curry-Ya, like many hole-in-wall Japanese spots in New York utilize the small storefront spaces with maximum  efficiency.I've had Curry-Ya a couple of times, and it's never disappointed when I'm in St. Marks and have a sudden feeding frenzy for Japanese curry. Their menu gives just the right number of choices. However, if you still can't decide on what to get - go with their recommendations, you can't go wrong with either the seafood curry or Berkshire pork cutlet curry...unless of course you're allergic or a vegetarian. Finally, if for some reason, you don't feel like curry while at Curry-Ya... the limited edition dishes, Hamburg-er Stew and Hayashi Rice are tasty non-curry dishes as well.*Cash Only*4-7pm happy hour with 50% off all drinks, that means it's $2 Sapporos...hard to beat.
Rosa S.}Brooklyn, NY}84}43}0}-1}5}5/11/2012}Why is this place so good?! Every time a friend is down in the dumps, I take them to Curry-Ya. Nothing can cheer a person up better than a mild food coma, and the portions here are generous enough but also delicious enough to guarantee that. I always order the seafood curry, extra spicy. It's very hard to finish, but I always do. It's so full of flavor and everything is cooked perfectly. My friends have gotten the tonkatsu and the chicken cutlet; both got rave reviews between mouthfuls of meat. They make it right in front of you and the kitchen is spotless. The place itself is tiny and very crowded, but actually very rarely loud, which is nice. They have a good drink selection (imported beers and Ramune!) and although I've never gotten dessert, they have a few options if you'd like to end your meal on a sweet note.You should also visit the bathroom. They have one of those fancy Japanese toilets that like, shoot rainbow colored water into the air. At least I hope that's what it's supposed to do....
Greg T.}Redondo Beach, CA}31}259}112}-1}4}5/7/2012}holy crap..curry-ya kills it...please open a LA location immediately. Berkshire tonkatsu fried so right...curry full of so much flavor.  spicy is the way to go. buddy told me to add cheese.  I usually roll traditional but went with cheese this time...very interesting....def. cheesy...not sure if i'll roll w/cheese the next time.  i want more....
Lucy C.}New York, NY}131}1173}43}18}4}5/5/2012}Came here last night and I loved it! It wasn't hard to find, just two blocks up from St. Mark's. The place is very small, even smaller than I had imagined. It was super crowded, which is a good sign. My friend and I were lucky, there were two chairs open all the way in the back. There were only two window seats and the rest were at the bar, where there is perfect view of the chefs. The menu didn't have too many options, so I guess they've narrowed it down to the best choices. The back had seasonal options that included baked curry with cheese! I entered up ordering the dry beef curry and my friend ordered the pork cutlet curry with a side of croquette. The food took a little while, but not too bad.  I watched the three chefs prepare many different types of Japanese curry. They were very efficient.My curry was amazing. Absolutely the best Japanese curry I've had, not that I've tried too many. Much better than Udon West's and Ramen Setagaya's. I really enjoyed the deep fried onions that were sprinkled on top. Could've done without the cold boiled egg slices though, it didn't really make a different to the dish. I tried some of my friend's pork cutlet curry and I'm glad I ordered the dry beef curry. The pork cutlet curry is a bit sweet for my taste. The croquette was very good though. The outside was very crispy and the inside melted in your mouth.The price was great! My dish was $8 and my friend's was $11. Sides are also very cheap. No wonder this place is so popular. I will definitely be back here to try all the different types of curry.
Jessica L.}Whitestone, NY}422}19}1}-1}4}5/3/2012}Love love loveee the cute little pot of sauce on the side. I hate when my rice is drenched in the sauce! The chicken curry was great, I wish the portions were a bit bigger, but the curry is so flavorful. Its definitely not those block curry cubes you get. The pork cutlets were also amazing!!!
KL Z.}Manhattan, NY}2}107}42}-1}3}4/30/2012}I like the curry but it tasted very much like the kind you get in box form in the supermarkets. I thought I was in for some amazing, symphony in your mouth curry but nope, just the curry in a box curry. Good nonetheless. The seafood curry didn't have enough seafood and the items inside were very generic. Frozen squid and such. The dry curry was actually better. Small joint, clean, nice staff. Maybe I'll come back if I'm in the mood for curry but too lazy to make my way to the grocery store for the box of stuff.
Brian L.}Hoboken, NJ}64}713}8}-1}4}4/24/2012Updatedreview}Came back for more curry...still super yummy.I just wish there was more meat.  Dammit!  It isn't enough food for me.  =(.  Only if I ate like a normal person and not a cow, I'd be oh so happy.
Ann L.}Fremont, CA}391}3047}25172}18}4}4/9/2012}CASH ONLY!  Tried to eat at Morimoto Noodle Bar, line was too long, then Ippudo - wait too long, finally decided to just try Curry-Ya that we walked past 2 times.  There were still some counter seats so we felt lucky.Lychee lassi 50% between 4-7pm the regular price of $4!  It's a small cup of yogurt & lychee & who knows what else.  I liked it.Seaweed salad $4 - small, tasty salad w/ some seaweed & dressing.  We liked it.Seasonal vegetable curry $8 - scoop of white rice, small pot of curry I got extra hot & comes with some veggies.  I liked it fine.B. got a Seafood curry $12 - he liked it fine, but later felt his stomach having problems.CASH ONLY.  One unisex bathroom in the back that's pretty tiny.
Elaine C.}New York, NY}7}17}9}-1}3}2/20/2012}Came here yesterday at 7pm but there was already a pretty line formed outside so decided to try back again today on a Monday night.Due to Curry-Ya being a tiny tiny place, we had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated, and another 15 -20 minutes before getting our food. The server made up with her very friendly attitude and smile. We ordered a plain curry with a small pork cutlet on the side and the dry beef curry. The plain curry + cutlet came with the curry on the side in this little pot, which I thought was a very cute touch. However the fact that the curry had NO ONIONS inside made my day. The curry itself was very sweet and creamy, and definitely worth a 30 minute wait. But I thought the pork cutlet was average. Maybe the Berkshire pork cutlet would be better? Tried some of the dry beef curry and it was delicious. Giving this place only three stars due to the slow service, so try to get here on the early side if you are famished like I was when I went! Also this place delivers, so if, once again, you're starving, come earlier or get it delivered. It was frustrating sitting at the wall and seeing all these orders before yours.
Monica J.}New York, NY}121}151}32}-1}5}2/11/2012}YA YA YA! (sorry)Tiny but immaculate. Servers are welcoming and always have a smile when delivering an order. Our waitress brought me the wrong beer and when I pointed it out to one of the other waitstaff they promptly fixed it and the waitress came by later to apologize as well. Providing completely flawless service is great but you don't have to be perfect to get 5 stars from me. I appreciate places that truly care about their customers and when they make a mistake, rather than trying to push blame onto someone else, actually acknowledge the mistake and apologize - that to me is the highest quality service. Ok, now the food. I got the dry beef dish... 1. not dry 2. DELICIOUS!! Oh man, that dish was soooo good I wish I had eaten it with my hands just so I could lick the amazing curry sauce off my fingers afterwards. That good. I tried the buckwheat ale from allagash which was great but my friend's lychee lassi was the BOMB! Mmmmmmmm. My only negative is that I didn't think my dish was spicy enough. But that was partially my fault as I didn't ask for clarification and, if I wasn't a complete pansy, I would have just ordered the extra hot!
Su W.}New York, NY}32}44}19}-1}5}2/9/2012}Oh my god. This place is just mouth orgasm. I'm drooling right now on recounting my memories there.It is the sibling of Rai Rai Ken and a hole in the wall type of place so I highly recommend you and your friends to go in small groups or seating will be difficult. The atmosphere is bright and friendly and the aroma of the restaurant is just divine~ Sitting down you're given a menu placard in which everything there is related to curry (as it should be). I gave the basic chicken curry a try while my friend tried the hamburger curry and we were in shock at how amazing it was when they delivered us our meal.The curry isn't served on top of the rice but instead is brought to you in a mini cauldron +_+. I find this to be reasonable since there might be some who enjoy the pure rice alone (which was excellent as well) and if you're those who like it over your rice, DIY! This place is one I highly recommend people to go out of their way and try. It is just divine and you'll leave the place feeling content and wanting to come back for more. If you do come find yourself believing that you will don't forget to get stamp via card or iphone, get it so that you'll get your free plate! I regret not doing that the first time I went because it was busy and I felt bad. Don't feel bad cause if you do, its you who will suffer (speaking from experience)!
J B.}Hicksville, NY}5}169}16}-1}2}2/4/2012}The food was mediocre.  Like the seaweed salad had like creamy dressing and mostly just regular salad ingredients with a few pieces of seaweed on top?  And the guy behind the counter forgot half the stuff we ordered.  We both thought the curry was good, but not great.
Michael P.}Brooklyn, NY}31}49}2}-1}4}1/31/2012}This place is great.. and the location basically makes it sort of like an outside food-court as there is an abundance of delicious eats all within steps from each other..  Their curry dishes are rich and creamy but not overwhelming.  I particularly like the Berkshire Pork Cutlet curry dish along with a cup of their Lychee Lassi to wash this down with..  Be sure to come somewhat early as these seats tend to fill up quick
Shing Yiing O.}Manhattan, NY}380}622}603}-1}4}1/30/2012}Hole in a Wall!!! Such a small restaurant with a friendly Japanese server.. The girl is so sweet and she is always with her smile.. My friend brought me here.. I haven't had good curry for quite some time.. I tried their vegetable curry.. Just medium spicy.. don't feel like eating spicy food on my first meal of the day.. it came with a complementary house salad.. nothing much on the salad.. it's just a normal salad...Here comes the curry... the curry is creamy and you will not feel sick of it.. I don't eat much rich so I gave half of the portion to my friend.. When I finished all of the vegetable.. I keep dipping into the curry just for a few sip.. till I finished'em all!! :DMy friend also ordered a appetizer.. I forgot what's the name.. It's a fried mince beef I guess... Not sure... It tasted like salty green beans too me. which I had it in Malaysia.. I LOVE IT!!! I don't really like fried stuff.. but I ate half of it.. :P and half of the portion I gave it to my 2 guy friends to share.. :P I took of 1 star because we waited more than 30 minutes for our food.. I think they definitely need to speed up their service... Oh ya!! You can even add 2 dollars if you prefer your curry to be baked with cheese.. :)
Judy C.}Financial District, NY}178}180}168}-1}4}1/26/2012}Love this quaint Japanese eatery! Curry-ya is especially perfect on a cold-wintery night. Always hits the spot :) pork chop & croquette are my faves.
Elle L.}New York, NY}179}155}2037}-1}3}1/24/2012}ordered the berkshire pork cutlet, waited not long for the cooks to fire up that curry, rice, and cutlet. the curry was carried inside a hot pot, and the rice and pre-cut cutlet came on a separate dish. i ordered the mildly spicy one, and it was nice. cutlet was very crispy on the outside with the breadcrumbs and chewy on the inside, almost to the point some pieces were too hard to bite off. since i did not order any drinks, total came around $13~14.
J K.}San Mateo, CA}0}7}0}-1}5}1/23/2012}Amazing place...I love curry, and some of the best I've ever had.  Try their baked curry - it has cheese and an egg, which sounds unusual, but it's delicious!If I could, would bring this place with me everywhere I lived.
Wai N.}Brooklyn, NY}340}115}111}-1}4}1/19/2012}Small tiny place but very good curry! Worth the wait and visit if you like curry...
Holly F.}Jersey City, NJ}8}24}6}-1}5}1/19/2012}Delicious, modern little place. I had no idea what Japanese Curry was but I'm glad it exists. It tastes to me like a more chillaxed brother of Indian curry with more sweetness and less bitterness. I've tried the Japanese Classic (yum) and the Berkshire Pork Cutlet (thought the breading was a bit too thick but whatever, it's Berkshire Pork!). The portions looked small at first but by the end I was thoroughly satisfied.By the way, this is totally unrelated to their food but you have to try their bathroom. They have one of those futuristic Japanese toilets. It's like a freaking robot.
Diana S.}Manhattan, NY}292}448}282}-1}5}1/19/2012}*CASH ONLY*Don't be like us and have to scrape together all the cash three NYC girls typically have to get some curry and BRING SOME $$$.We arrived around 7:30 on a Wednesday night. It was pretty empty when we got there, but it got PACKED around 8pm. So I'd suggest an early meal if you're not looking to wait. The place is teeny tiny and all counter space. Fits 15 people max.The menu is pretty simple, we all opted for the dried beef curry as that was what was recommended. Also it was simply too cold outside for any one of us to go and get cash from the Chase that is legit around the corner...and we only had like $30 between the three of us.I just had Go! Go! Curry on Monday and wasn't too impressed, but I LOVED Curry-ya's curry! Yum. SOOO GOOD. It was a little sweet (there are raisins in it) but still hearty and savory (I opted for extra hot...which was really like a medium hot, if that). The portions are humongo. I was STUFFED after my meal (I had like 3 bites left and really could not fit anymore in my tummy).Best part is we stayed within our cash budget!  =)
Vintage G.}Manhattan, NY}0}36}0}-1}3}1/6/2012}Not bad of a place. Decent curry and decent deep fried pork. I used to love this place (since GO GO Curry is too far) but couple of things made me deter from it. 1. The girl who was handling my food was the one who was touching the money. She did not have gloves or washed her hand when she touched my contain for take out. She grabbed the egg with her hand after taking my money. Gross. 2. To make curry not spicy, they add cream. It is stated on the menu. I am not a big fan of this method.
Jimmy C.}Manhattan, NY}207}173}17}-1}4}1/2/2012}You need to hurrya to currya! lolReally delicious Japanese style curry. The portion sizes aren't too large and the food is spot on!FOOD:Can not go wrong with Currya! They have really tasty curries made from scratch. Its nice to see the chefs at work. I had the pork cutlet one and my friend had the seafood one. Both were rich and creamyish. In the seafood one they put the seafood in the sauce to pour over the rice! The cutlets were fried well and not over battered either. ATMOSPHERE:Small tight seating but with a modern twist. Bar seating style.  There is literally only a foot of space from sitting at the table and to circulate...really cramped. Go in small groups! When I went to the restroom i literally was bumping everyone's back...they really didn't think that through. Also the reception area is literally ZERO so waiting for a table is a pain and your like talking over people to the waitress to figure things out. Bad space planning on the interior design in my opinion.  SERVICE:Small but fast and efficient. They kinda cattle you in and out a little bit. Not a big fan of those asian types that do that. Be a little bit more hospitable please.For authetnic style Japanese Curry, This is a must. The prices may be a little more than it should be but thats ok. The food makes up for it!
Navi S.}New York, NY}13}55}33}-1}4}12/31/2011}Very nice place, very good curry. Its served in a long tin cup that you can spread as you please. The chicken or pork is perfect, but the portions are a little small. You'll be having as much rice as meat in order to get full use of the curry. The curry is warm and full of flavor, excellent! The place itself is very small, so don't be surprised bumping into people getting a place to sit. The service was nice and fast, and the food was great, a fantastic spot!
Allison M.}New York, NY}22}27}1}-1}4}12/31/2011}Some of the  best curry I had in a while. The service was very nice, I only wish I had some room for dessert!I was surprised by how small it was, but don't let that steer you away!
Vi N.}Manhattan, NY}374}237}1000}-1}4}12/28/2011}Nothing is more filling then rice and some curry. For being a counter style restaurant, I wasn't expecting for the food to come out in such modern settings. I got the "Japanese Classic" Extra Hot which was rice, and curry with beef, carrots, potatos & green beans. The curry was not spicy at all, even thou it was "extra hot" I was tempted to ask for chili oil or pepper flakes to make it spicier but I was kinda content w/the flavoring of my curry.  The curry came on the side, and you are to pour it on your rice as you please. They have sides of pickled leeks and ginger on the counter for you. I enjoyed the curry, but prefer it to be spicier. If you come during lunch, all dishes include a side salad. The miso dressing on the salad is really good!
Anne L.}Manhattan, NY}147}70}23}-1}3}12/28/2011}The curry was solid though I didn't feel it was particularly unique.  I do like how at Curry-Ya you can choose your level of spice (though the extra spicy didn't really do much for me).   As many of the reviews have noted, the serving portion was definitely small - not enough curry at the end to eat with the large amount of rice they provided.  Pork chop was good, but could have been balanced out a bit more with a pickled veggie side (this one came with two green beans: a bit awkward; either add in more veggies or leave it out in my opinion).I would probably still choose Katsuhama's pork katsu curry over this one (which has a substantial amount of curry - enough to accompany the rice after you finish the pork, as well as delicious picked veggies on the side), but overall Curry-Ya still has a good deal - especially since their prices are about to drop.  It's also a good place to get curry if you are a vegetarian - something not often offered at other curry restaurants.Service was prompt, but cold.
Eva W.}Washington, DC}22}55}0}-1}3}12/26/2011}Whoa, I've had a lot of japanese curry in my days and none was as good as this one. I got the dry beef curry with the mini pork cutlet on the side because i've heard of how amazing it was. It exceeded my expectations. Everything was very well seasoned and the pork was fried to perfection. I also had a salad before that. I don't exactly remember the name of it, but it had a little cheese, green beans, tofu skin, and some  sauce. Really good! I'm so coming back the next time I visit east village. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves japanese curry :)
Kevin W.}Manhattan, NY}45}548}18}-1}5}12/19/2011}After I discoverd the S&B Golden Curry pack, I thought there was never a point in ordering curry at a restaurant since I could make a pretty decent curry in 5 min at home.  This place changed my mind. The curry here is awesome.  The pork cutlet curry is excellent, perfectly crispy, made to order, and not overly fatty - my go to here.  The beef curry is also excellent. The croquettes are decent.  Only about 8 seats here.  This block has now become a perfect tri-fecta of Asian goodness - Shabu Tatsu, Rai Rai Ken, and Curry-Ya all side-by-side - it's like when Taco Bell teamed up with Pizza Hut to offer a super convenient panoply of choice.  I hereby dub this strip...Awesome Asian Dining Row.  TM. C.  This place is cash only.
Stewart C.}New York, NY}39}85}29}-1}5}12/9/2011}Curry-Ya should be renamed to CURRY-YUM!I was here a few months ago and it is absolutely YUMMY!  The place is a little small but very cozy and did i say that the curry is yummy!  I got the Berkshire pork cutlet.  It was fried to perfection, the meat was amazing and combined with the curry it became heavenly.  On top of that since November their menu prices went down and not up!  2 thumbs up!!If you like Japanese-style curry definitely check this place out.  I think i am going to go back tonight for dinner before going out! :)
Share W.}New York, NY}71}409}634}-1}4}12/7/2011}Japanese curry is definitely tasty and they know how to do it right.  I wish it was bigger.  They only have counter seating and 2 window seats.  A great way to watch their art form of preparing their dishes.I had the pork cutlet and the chicken cutlet.  They both are delicious and don't know which i'd order over because I'd always go w/a friend and split the meats.A satisfying meal after having a few drinks.
Jon T.}Berkeley, CA}0}24}0}-1}5}12/5/2011}This is one of my favorite places to eat in the east village. The seaweed salad, the Japanese curry classic, and a glass of wine are the perfect meal.  Thank you curry ya.
Takashi W.}Manhattan, NY}2}50}0}-1}3}12/5/2011}Curry-Ya beats any of the "Japanese" restaurants which line St. Marks Place, but with each plate of curry priced at least $11-$12, I would choose 55 curry over Curry-Ya any day.
Angel H.}Brooklyn, NY}118}108}35}-1}4}11/28/2011}Silence while eating with a group means that either:1. The food is really good2. Someone said something inappropriate and just made things really awkward.For the three of use eating at Curry-Ya, it was the first one.Really small place, but the bar seats made the place really cozy and inviting. Plus you get to see the people prepare and make your food.I got Chicken Curry, mild. Perfect amount of heat. I worried it would be bland, and not at all spicy, but it was savory, sweet, and spicy all at the same time.The reason why I gave it only 3 stars is because of the price. $11 for curry? It was great, but with $11, I could've gotten a burrito at Chipotle and a drink and would've been beyond stuffed.
Olaya B.}Manhattan, NY}3}23}1}-1}5}11/24/2011}yum! never tried japanese curry before but was delighted. soft and flavorful, hearty, wholesome, not heavy or greasy. veggies! and nice atmosphere, fun to watch the cooks!
mark c.}Manhattan, NY}46}50}19}-1}5}11/18/2011}This place is so tiny but well worth the squeeze.  I got mild curry with chicken cutlet. The curry is somehow different from what I'm used to in LA but the flavor is very very good.  The chicken was perfectly cooked...very moist.  I'll be back for sure.
Erica S.}Manhattan, NY}277}210}26}-1}4}11/9/2011}After refusing to wait 2 hours at Kenka, my friends and I ventured off the beaten path and ended up at Curry-Ya. I was a little skeptical at first because the restaurant was tiny and I'm not a huge fan of curry. However, I had a great experience and am definitely going back!- Tiny restaurant that fits about 10 people. The counter/bar area is a great place to sit because you can watch the chef's prepare your food!- Hamburger steak was great! Doesn't taste like your traditional Japanese curry so great for those who aren't a big Asian curry fan.- The baked curry is a must! For an extra $2 you can have your curry topped off with an egg cheese and baked! Definitely worth it!- The pickled ginger / onions are a great complement to your meal!
Huong L.}Astoria, NY}37}15}74}-1}5}11/2/2011Updatedreview}Buy 7 curries, get 1 FREEIf you are obsessed with this place like I do and you own an Iphone. Download an app called STAMPT Because................. Buy 7 curries, get 1 FREE. woot wootit's not really "7 curries" though, it's more like eating there 7 times (getting 7 stamps, hey it rhymes) cause it doesn't matter how many curries you buy, you can only get one stamp per one visit
Lily L.}New York, NY}301}235}31}18}4}11/1/2011}After having access to the most amazing Japanese curry from studying abroad in Japan, I've had some pretty high standards for kickass curry. This place comes pretty damn close, and that's sayin' a lot. They offer a decent number of offerings, including Berkshire Pork curry (my mouth is drooling just thinking about it), that is tender, crunchy, and flavorful. I usually recommend this for a first timer. The dried beef (what, DRIED beef?) is a unique offering I've never seen before, but is amazing as well. The beef is really tasty and not at all chewy (an immediate concern of mine). If you want to go all out, you can order the beef curry with a side of the Berkshire Pork to try it out. As a complement to the curry, there are usually little containers of pickled daikon and pickled shallots (herm, I THINK those are what they are?). I usually clean out these pickles, as they are just delicious and you are just stupid if you don't eat generous amounts of them with your curry. Even if you're not a fan of pickled things, just try it -- I've converted a number of folks.  I believe during the daytime they offer a happy hour, which is half off drinks. I was able to score green tea/oolong tea/ramunes for $1, which is a steal. Note: You can find the menu online, but note that some of the prices have gone up by a dollar.
Hong L.}Brooklyn, NY}304}612}191}18}4}10/24/2011}Eating this curry reminded me of when I had a hot plate of curry at the 8th Station on Mount Fuji. Add picked shallots and I am in heaven.Nothing is better than a hot plate of curry on a fall evening. I got the vegetable curry with a small side of chicken and an organic raw egg. My boyfriend got the berkshire pork cutlet curry with a croquetto. They serve the curry in its individual size hot bowl and you can pour the curry onto your rice however you like it. Some like to pour the whole thing on; some like to pour more a little to make sure you have enough curry for the rest of the rice. I'm the latter. I portion out my rice and pour the right amount of curry and veggies on it with a helping side of shallots. The curry is thick and it had a nice heat to it. The veggies are fresh and big sized. I would not get the raw egg again as it didn't cook up fast enough in the curry. Better yet, we came during happy hour (i think 4-7) which means 50% off drinks! It is a bit pricey but this isn't a daily excursion. This is your "treat yourself to a nice homemade meal with the $$ sign attached". Remember to go for happy hour, go early (get filled up by 6ish), and get a stamp card!
Lili K.}Manhattan, NY}286}2518}159}-1}4}10/16/2011}Small, yet cute and clean curry spot.  We had the corner seats that faced the outdoors.Side note:  the bathroom was pretty cute.  Moving on-I had the baked curry, which had an egg and cheese on top-I really enjoyed that!  The extra $2 will definitely make your curry better.  As for the curry, it was pretty solid as well.  Nothing else too exciting/unique to add onto that.
Richard D.}New York, NY}134}1448}311}18}3}10/14/2011}Hmm, that's it?I came here on the recommendation of a friend.I prefer Go Go curry.   The space is small and if you're claustrophobic it may set you off. The portion was a bit meager for what you're paying $13 for small rice and small metal pot of curry and pork cutlet.The curry here was lacking the richness and flavor (or maybe Gogo was so good bc it was the first time I've had it) and it had a bit of sourness to it.Cash only.
Yooie S.}New York, NY}104}109}27}-1}4}10/13/2011}try beef dried curry! tastes even better with more toppings!
Radford T.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}602}451}157}-1}3}10/7/2011}I have never liked Japanese curry, and unfortunately Curry-Ya has failed to change my mind.  Don't get me wrong - it wasn't bad.  It just also wasn't very good either.  I live very close to Curry-Ya and one late afternoon I was very hungry because I didn't eat lunch, so I went in for some early dinner.The only seating at Curry-Ya is bar-style.  You can witness the staff of about 4 or 5 preparing the food in front of you.  I ordered the Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry, with an organic raw egg as a side.  The pork came with a fried breaded exterior, and the curry was served from a stone bowl.  Patrons are to use a ladle to apply the curry sauce to their dishes in the amount they preferred.  The spiciness of the curry came in regular, hot, or extra hot.  I ordered hot, but really should have ordered extra hot.  The raw organic egg itself was served in a little bowl.I applied the curry and the raw egg to the pork.  It was all just ok, but nothing to motivate me to go back.
Taka A.}Clifton, NJ}39}50}2}-1}5}10/7/2011}I love people who pay attention to detail...Curry-Ya pays attention to the finest details and for those who don't appreciate that...you may just miss out on the beauty of this place.  Japanese curry is not something that people usually consider to be japanese...but we've adopted/adapted curry to be our very own.  Its unual to find a place state side where a place is dedicated to this niche but I'm so glad curry-ya did!This small restaurant pays homage to all dishes that are japanese curry related...from the pork kastu curry (my favorite), the hambagu with curry all the way to hayashi rice!  And they do it soooo well.They prepare each dish spearately and heat up each portion of the curry separately out of the big pot they make on site everyday.  This attention to details ensures that each person gets a dish that has been custom prepared based on your preference of heat and meat!Must stop before I start drooling on my desk...
Johnson C.}Toronto, Canada}292}757}435}18}4}10/6/2011}Okay - this is a pretty legit J-curry joint.  It's somehow less and more authentic than Go! Go! Curry.Seems a bit poseur to call it 'gourmet curry'.  If they meant it in Engrish-Japanese sense, it's perfectly acceptable (as in 'Best Gourmet Curry Special Make Dream For You!  Power!").  Combined with all-white aesthetic and soft lounge music - it kinda threw me off.  The other thing is they offer lassi on the drink menu -- which may throw off people new to J-curry as it's nothing like the original Indian version.What makes this place authentic is the cramped bar-only seating and the Japanese service: cordial yet plastic.  And of course, solid curry.The curry is bit richer and flavourful than what you'll find at Go! Go! - they boast about the secret recipe curry using oxtail and vegetables cooked for hours.  Sounded like some bullshit hype - but the quality definitely shows and it's pricier to match.I grabbed the Berkshire pork cutlet curry ($12), hot and added extra sauce (+$3) which also got me more rice.  The hot added a nice kick and the cutlet was sufficiently tender and juicy.  All points were present.To be honest, there's not many flaws with Curry-Ya at all.  But I'm dishing them a 4-star because I still prefer Go! Go!.  But perfectly respectable J-curry (either of them opening a restaurant in my hometown would bring me tears of joy) - a bit higher quality in an environment that feels far less fast food.  You can even get beer or sake here.Kyle C. is pretty bang-on with his summary - Go! Go! is more like your typical fast food J-curry in Japan - only Americanized with it's terrible embarrassment of riches and portions.  [Come on, America - a 'large soda' is the size of a beer growler.  Don't hate it for giving you what you want.  Even the bastion of Canadian identity, Tim Horton's, has bent to your mighty will.]Maybe I'm addicted to hoodrats, it's more 'authentic'/value-oriented or I just like the idea of multiple dead animals on my plate, but I still like Go! Go! more.  Curry-Ya may have went to a better school and has better taste - but you want Go! Go! in your corner when shit hits the fan.
JT C.}Manhattan, NY}75}66}5}-1}3}10/1/2011}Small restaurant (cramp diner size) but the service is fast and the curry theme food is tremendously tasty!  The restaurant was packed during my visit.  Highly recommended.  Get the curry dried beef dish!
R Y.}Manhattan, NY}43}270}340}-1}4}9/22/2011}Review for curse seasonal veg. curryIt was delicious! Smooth curry flavor and the vegetables very fresh and not overcooked.also, I added cheese to the curry and it added more to the delicious curry. Very cute place and prices are modest. Go try their curry and see if you can taste any other japanesecurries.
Jinshil L.}Rockville, MD}0}48}0}-1}4}9/21/2011}Quick diner like service. Get in, get out.Sometimes...no seating -_-Good portionNo personal spaceCash only, I think...Great for eating solo if you're on the run!Food was mediocre and the price was about $12 I think, depending on what you got. You can get much better food but the atmosphere is so tiny and NY-like, that I bump my 3 to a 4. The fact that the restaurant manages to survive in that tiny space....kudos.
Ryu O.}FOREST HILLS, NY}0}8}0}-1}4}9/17/2011}food's great but the place is too small.  it's bar-style only and if you're unlucky enough to sit next to a stranger, you will feel very cramped.  i really love the katsu-curry.  if only they were a little bigger.
Questa K.}Brooklyn, NY}268}4}9}-1}4}9/15/2011}I went there around 3:50pm which was like 10 mins before the lunch time end. So I ordered a hamburger curry and my boyfriend ordered the beef dried curry. I like the appetizer because the vinegar had little pepper but it didn't taste any spicy or sour. It enhanced the flavor of the veggies. The I ordered the O-Loong tea(not sure about the spelling HAHAHA) but it was bad. It tasted nothing like the tea that i was expecting. Plus, it had a lot of ice. After a while the tea flavor just faded away.Then when the main dishes were here, it looked fantastic and pretty! When I ate the hamburger, it was kinda disappointed because it was too oily but when you eat the burger with the rice and curry, it balanced out!For my bf's dish, it tasted pretty good but I only tried like 2 bites. He said it tasted good so i  will take his word! :)So at the end the bill was like around 16~17 per person. :) It was a pretty good experience!Definitely come again! :D
AndresSamuel R.}Queens, NY}39}99}0}-1}5}9/8/2011}Fantastic! My ground beef curry dish rocked! The cutlet curries being served also looked scrumptious. This is a place that specializes in Japanese curries and executes them beautifully. It's a small place, with only counter seating, so not a good option for groups. But, if you're dining solo or with a friend, this spot is not to be missed.
Abul R.}Brooklyn, NY}46}271}123}18}5}9/5/2011}I am a sucker for Japanese Curry. When I say I crave Curry people assume it's cause I grew up eating it but that is a completely different animal!I walked around 30 minutes looking for a specific curry joint in Tokyo...This is the closest thing I've found since then.It's a small place with only a handful of seats on the counter. They have some nice Japanese beers, and mainly one thing on the menu - you guessed it.It's the combinations that make it so customizable. I've tried them all and I prefer the chicken katsu the best, but I like to add on a beef-and-potato croquette (deep-fried deliciousness of mashed potato with some ground beef). But I honestly don't think you can go wrong with anything here.
Ada Y.}New York, NY}31}337}38}-1}3}8/31/2011}The curry tasted like the regular Japanese curry. It was nothing special. Beef mushroom combined with raisins tasted strange. The mild curry flavor was intensely strong. I do not suggest curry over rice. It's best to have the curry on the side.
Kyle C.}Manhattan, NY}17}86}0}-1}4}8/30/2011}If you love Japanese curry you've probably already tried Go Go Curry in midtown, which is a fair approximation of the run-of-the-mill fast-food curry shops in Tokyo.  Curry-Ya is its upscale cousin, the kind that prefers trappist ale to PBR, and went to a private university instead of CUNY.Okay, Curry-Ya's really not all that fancy, but it is a step up from the typical curry shop.  The presentation is simple, and the curry is tasty.  My only rub is that the curry isn't spicy enough.  I had ordered the extra hot dried beef curry and barely felt any heat.  The mild chicken curry was actually more sweet than it was spicy.Try going early to avoid the inevitable crowds.
Mijune C.}New York, NY}43}98}0}-1}4}8/18/2011}First thing I noticed was how small yet clean the place was. It's set up like a bar with stools so I wouldn't recommend going there with a group of more than maybe 3 or 4. The prices are not bad at all and the Berkshire fried pork curry was really good. You get the fried pork cutlet and rice on your plate with an individual cast iron pot with the curry. The pork was nicely fried and the rice was perfectly chewy to be drowned in the curry. It was very satisfying and a great spot to get a quick fix of some good Japanese style curry!
Carol Y.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}2}2}0}-1}5}8/18/2011}If you're a big fan of curry, this place definitely will not disappoint.  First of all, the restaurant is super small and it's mostly bar seating (with the exception of 2 seats that look out the window) so it's probably not good if you're there with a really large group but it's great because you can see them preparing your dish and you know that this place is clean (and I don't know about you, but in my book at least, cleanliness is pretty darn important!).  Speaking of watching them prepare your dish,  they prepare each meal individually.  I'm pretty sure the curry is already pre-made but they re-heat everything in super small batches.  At any rate, if there's a wait, it's totally worth it!!I went here this past weekend with my sister and my boyfriend.  I ordered the beef dried curry and it's a wonderful mix of savory and slightly sweet little bits of meat swimming in a thick curry sauce all on top of rice.  It was topped off with these dried strands of yummy-ness (I think they were fried shallots).  Complete amazing.My sister got the Berkshire pork cutlet curry (hot heat) with a boiled egg and it was equally good - fantastic flavor and the pork cutlet was pretty firm.My boyfriend got the seasonal vegetable curry (extra hot) with a mini pork cutlet.  The cutlet was basically a smaller version of what my sister got and the vegetables that came with his was extremely well done.Both my sister's and my boyfriend's dishes came with the rice on a plate (my sister's boiled egg was placed sliced in a boil, and my boyfriend's cutlet was on the plate) and then they each also got a small crock with the curry (this is the same crock they use to heat it up and my boyfriend's vegetables were in this crock) and they could ladle it onto their rice/meat themselves.  If you like to eat spicy, don't be afraid to try the extra hot because it's really not super spicy.  All three of us got a croquetto which was again really well done.  The outside was extremely crunchy while the inside was moist and wonderful.  There are jars of dried (or fried) onion flakes, pearl onions (maybe pickled?), and pickled ginger everywhere that you can sprinkle on top of your dish, but let me assure you that as much as I love onion (and that jar absolutely smelled heavenly), the curry is so well flavored you won't even need it!  The portions were reasonably generous for the price and definitely filled us up.  We'll definitely have to come back soon and try the desserts because they sounded really good.
Athena C.}San Francisco, CA}925}1562}681}18}4}8/14/2011}If you love Japanese curry, you should definitely try Curry-Ya. I live right next door and I regret not giving it a try earlier. They have several flavors of curry and different toppings to choose from. I got to sample the Japanese classic style curry which has potatoes, carrots and beef stew simmered in thick curry sauce over rice. I added additional chicken cutlet as my topping and truth be told, it was good for two meals. the price ended up being a little over $10. $10 for two meals is a steal! There are very limited seating though so be prepared for a wait on a busy night. Good thing I live next door and I can always just do takeout :)
Joe F.}Charlotte, NC}1}9}1}-1}4}8/6/2011}The quality of the home-cooked curry definitely tickles the palate. My the texture of the chicken breast in my chicken curry was silky, and the thickness of the curry felt right. This place delivers quality cooking.However if you are really hungry, this place may not satisfy you. I also had the regular lassi, which tasted fresh, and felt that I could use another 15% more food. The portions are indeed smaller, like compared to Curry House in Monterey Park. Maybe one upside is if you're going out afterwards you won't be burping curry all night.Seating is limited, but there's Rai Rai Ken next door to balance the customers.
Danielle C.}Jersey City, NJ}103}189}14}-1}4}8/3/2011}It's a small place- pretty much only counter seating.  I felt like I was eating a home cooked meal... in Japan. Vegetarian curry was really seasonal and tasty.  I added a pork cutlet on the side to satisfy the carnivore in me.  The cutlet was smaller than what comes with the pork main dish, but it was the perfect amount for me.    Could probably have shared a dish between the two of us and felt fine, but we were hungry and ordered a dish each- we left fully stuffed (and very satisfied). defintely a fan!
Joyce K.}Fullerton, CA}388}335}193}-1}5}7/30/2011}I have a huge soft spot in my heart for japanese curry.  I think the curry here is just super yummy and filling and REASONABLY priced!!!!  They present it so cute and you can self serve some pickled radishes.  The restaurant is NOT big...you basically sit around the bar area and that's about it so don't bring a huge party here.  The bathroom has a BIDEH which I LOVE!!!  Bar seating is annoying but has its advantages.  You will notice right away that this place is totally sanitary and clean.  The cutlets were delicious and freshly made.  Each dish that you order is prepared in front of you (not made from scratch but at least heated up and not just ladled from a big vat).  My friend and I tried it out on Thursday...went back on Saturday with a craving.  They do to-go orders as well.  My friend says she likes Go-Go curry way better and i'll have to do some comparing but so far, I would say try Curry-Ya out!
Johnny D.}Spring Valley, NV}1}22}0}-1}5}7/27/2011}A reasonably priced restauraunt who serves it's functions well,They do deliver, so you don't have to always have pizza when you feel lazy
Hosung S.}Manhattan, NY}10}4}0}-1}4}7/26/2011}Visit Date: 7/25/11I passed by this place several times for few months before finally deciding to give it a try.  With so many options in East Village, I never had to travel more than few blocks from my apartment before an eatery sang its siren's song inviting me in.  On this date, the combination of my aimless walking and fickle palette drew me in. Upon entering, I noticed clean, modern, and professional kitchen and counter space.  I sat down on the last stool towards the inner part of the restaurant and observed the prepping and cooking in progress.  With the loungy music softly playing in the background, well-dressed cooks purposely moved around in a tight space to clean, chop, and cook meat and vegetables in a seamless manner.  Watching them operate in this setting assured me I was going to get an above-average meal and was strangely therapeutic.  After perusing the menu, I decided on Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry because I loved don katsu as a typical kid growing up in Korea and wondered how it would work with Japanese curry.  While hesitant to do so, I chose "Hot" for spiciness because I wanted something with a kick on this particular day.  For a drink, I went with mango lychee because it sounded interesting and thought it would pair up well with the dish.Drink:Sweet and thick with chopped mangoes served in an aluminum cup reminiscent of how milkshakes are served.  Slightly thick for my taste but was a good counter to the taste of curry.Dish:Pork cutlet was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of breading and supple pork.  Curry was above average but lacked any real kick contrary to the level of spiciness I desired and ordered (As a frame of reference, I am not one of those people that love very spicy food.  So when I say it wasn't spicy, it was probably quite bland).  In addition, I am used to seeing several types of vegetables (carrots, potatoes, onions) finely chopped into the curry per Japanese or Korean curry tradition.  I was disappointed to see their absence in my curry dish.  There were some token string beans there but they needed some friends.Service:Efficient, cordial in typical Japanese fashionCost:$20 flat including tip (FYI, this joint is cash only so bring the greenbacks)
Nick T.}Manhattan, NY}0}33}1}-1}4}7/19/2011}If the tonkatsu was under $12, i would have rated this 5 stars. Their sauce is excellent. Haven't had a better tonkatsu in NYC yet.
Trevor G.}New York, NY}0}22}0}-1}2}7/12/2011}If you like eating overpriced "museum quality food" then this is the place for you. I was hoping for better so was disappointed. Plus our server seemed to loath her job. Maybe it was just us.
Felix M.}Williamsburg, NY}37}66}182}-1}3}7/11/2011}Pricey for small portion.... curry sauce is Ok, not extraordinary. With open kitchen, you can see how they prepare the dish with food pre-cooked. Staff are friendly, but the place is small.
Jeremy B.}Manhattan, NY}63}42}10}-1}5}7/9/2011}This is one of my favorite lunch spots in east village.  Like the name suggests, they serve mostly curry dishes, and the curry is some of the best I've had.  The inside is small, but well designed and relaxing.  You sit at a bar and watch the staff prepare your food . . . the chopping of fresh vegetables and breading of tender cutlets definitely adds to the experience, and you can tell the ingredients are first-rate.I've tried a variety of curry dishes here, and liked them all.  The pork cutlet curry is the most filling, and my favorite;  I often add a hard-boiled egg on the side which is a nice compliment to the dish.  But I have also tried the seasonal vegetable, seafood, and beef dried curry, and all are excellent.The only drawback is that the place is small, and really not good for groups or dates;  also doesn't take credit cards.  Other than that, you surely will not be disappointed, as the place operates with nearly flawless Japanese precision.  Enjoy.
Christine Y.}New York, NY}36}132}8}-1}4}6/18/2011}4.5 starsProbably the best curry I've tried. Authentic Japanese curry served in a small stone pot with a mound of rice on a plate. I ordered the vegetable curry and let's just say it was amazing. The rice is cooked to perfection.The portions are decent. Men may need double the amount they serve.The service is excellent. They were willing to answer questions. The place is clean looking and I love the bar stools.
ET B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}26}0}-1}4}6/15/2011}My first Japanese curry experience in NYC was last night. I was so excited and pleased with the experience that I am inclined to give this place 5 stars. But for now I will leave it at 4 stars for the following reason: it wasn't my personal favorite type of curry. I was told that they use cream in the curry and I believe it is because of this that the curry seemed a little sweeter than I am used to. I like mild curry and it was the best Japanese curry that I've had in the States but still I have to withhold five stars until I've ventured a little further and see if there's a curry out there that matches my taste as well as the quality of Curry-Ya. The service was good as well. It was a small place and empty though so not sure what it will be like when it's busy.
Joe G.}Silver Spring, MD}50}89}25}-1}4}6/14/2011}Delicious curry (with hints of Indian spices), perfectly cooked tonkatsu (crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside), superb rice, and an interesting croquette whose flavors reminded me of a samosa.This place is currylicious indeed!
Katie S.}New York, NY}12}26}1}-1}4}6/6/2011}One of the best (Japanese) curry in town. Simple as that. I constantly come back here and NEVER once disappointed.
Candy C.}Jersey City, NJ}31}23}191}-1}4}5/19/2011}I tried the homemade hamburger curry today and it was amazing. The pork cutlet was also great. The only thing is that there was no veggie in the curry. Next time I probably will order vege curry with pork cutlet as a top. o(^^)o
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}4}5/15/2011}Japanese curry...I think I'm addicted, and ever since Teriyaki Boy closed near my office, I've been going through withdrawal.  I went with the Beef Dried Curry which is ground beef, an egg, and a few other vegetables.  It was definitely a hit for only $8.  For an extra $3 I got some vegetables on the side and it was a great complement to the dish.  The portion was pretty sizeable and I was full after combining it with a salad.  Service was super quick, in and out in 45 minutes probably.  I'll definitely be back here when I'm looking for something quick and cheap, (is $15 cheap these days?)
Lucius K.}New York, NY}87}58}0}-1}5}5/1/2011}This is my favorite place in NYC to get authentic Japanese curry, and it's also the only place in NYC to get authentic Japanese curry. But seriously, it's good. Sure, you can get those packets of Vermont Curry that you put in boiling water for 3 minutes and then pour over rice, but this place is much better. This place uses fresh ingredients and it tastes good without being too filling. My favorites are the Japanese Classic and the Curry Chicken dishes, and I usually get the Berkshire Pork Cutlet to go with it. They also have Hayashi Rice, a.k.a. "Fake Curry" because it looks like curry but doesn't taste like it. I've also had the Seafood Curry but I don't think curry goes well with seafood. You can get the curry in 4 different levels of spicyness, but I always get the regular, which is not hot at all, and I have a sensitive tongue. If you go there for lunch before 4 pm, you get a free salad with your curry, but it seems like you get a slightly smaller amount of curry than dinner. Curry, like ramen, is one of those staples of Japanese cuisine that some people eat every day in Japan, unlike sushi, which is usually just a couple times a week. Go here to experience the everyday food of Japan.
Mai L.}New York, NY}213}367}416}-1}3}4/23/2011}I'm not sure if I am a huge fan of Japanese Curry. Some people say that it is really good comfort food and I guess I can see where they are coming from with that statement. Personally, I think that it's a bit too sweet and not spicy enough for my taste. However, the crowd seem to love Curry Ya. They have a nice tiny dining area and people can sit and socialize around the kitchen. The presentation of the food was very nice and the atmosphere was comfortable. I would probably go again to try some of the other stuff on the menu.
David L.}Princeton, NJ}36}30}13}-1}4}4/22/2011}Don't expect a wide selection, don't expect to pay by credit card, and don't expect to sit in a proper chair at an actual table (do expect, instead, to be jostled on your stool by people making their way to the bathroom in this tiny shoebox of a restaurant).  But I'll be darned if they aren't the best at what they do.  This may be the best Japanese curry I've ever had, and that's allowing for 3 months spent in Tokyo.  I had the special Hayashi rice (described as a demi-glace over mushrooms, beef, and onions) and my wife had the "Hamburg stew" (hamburger meat, submerged in stew and baked in a casserole dish).  Truly delectable.  Oishikatta desu!  And just the thing for a brisk spring evening.  If Japanese curry is sounding even vaguely tasty to you, you can't go wrong here (and the specials were every bit as good as they sounded).  Do one thing, do it extremely well, name your restaurant after it, and keep everything simple.  What's not to like?
Darah P.}Washington, DC}15}11}1}-1}4}4/20/2011}Consistently delicious Japanese curry! I like that you get a range of curry options and add-ons as well :) Also reasonably priced.
Ed W.}Manhattan, NY}36}93}0}-1}3}4/16/2011}came here once, cant say it was great, but it was above average. menu is someone what limited, and if you are not a curry fan, dont come here.i would definitely come back to try the other dishes, but i can probably try everything in under 10 visits. not much to look at, a pretty small but popular hole in the wall. definitely come by and have a try.
Suanne L.}Brooklyn, NY}199}934}754}18}3}4/9/2011}Food friend Jon F. and I wanted something savory but not heavy, delectable rather than greasy, and affordable. Enter Curry-Ya. The set up is clean and more spaced out than its neighbor Rai Rai Ken. I ordered the seasonal vegetable curry, which was the same curry base as the rest of the dishes with fresh mushrooms and pumpkin to make this a real hearty treat. Jon F had berkshire pork curry tonkatsu which was fantastic. The mango lassi was very thick and rich. 3 stars. Satisfactory and novel, but not astounding.
Michelle Z.}Brooklyn, NY}58}50}1}-1}5}4/8/2011}This is such an awesome place to eat with a friend or a date. It's small but theres so much going on in there, it's not one of those typical quaint restaurants. I tried almost everything on their menu and I must say, I can't stop going back! They make the food right in front of you :) And they are super with customer service. HIGHLY recommended.
Mike S.}New York, NY}1}246}0}-1}3}4/8/2011}I thought it was just ok and a bit pricey.
Angel K.}Forest Hills, NY}212}204}85}-1}4}3/28/2011}Because I have eaten so much boil on the stove, in a bag instant or just korean curry rice, Im not a big Japanese curry fan. But I actually enjoyed Curry-ya's hamburg stew. I like their exclusive seating feel .. reminded me of Momofuku ko. I love watching my food being prepared. The service is good and the food/drinks are fairly priced. I never knew Japanese curry gained this much popularity. It was a pretty quick eat and an overall good experience.
Joanna L.}New York, NY}197}360}234}-1}5}3/27/2011}I know I'm going to drool a little when I write this...I went to Curry Ya after being disappointed by not being able to get into Shabu Tatsu, but I was NOT disappointed. I was very very happy to find a delicious berkshire pork cutlet with curry and a lovely bed of rice. Although servings are "small" in most cases, it's perfect for me since I find that I tend to overeat at most places.The tonkatsu was amazingly juicy and tender. Fried to a perfect golden perfection. The piece was small, but the flavor made up for size.The regular curry was a tinge of spicy (or what most people would say, not spicy at all). It was flavorful and mixed into a huge mess over the rice and pork was a delicious meal [cue some drooling right now].The service is cute, the space is tight (a counter space with narrow aisle), but perfect for up to 4 (max) friends to sit at the counter corner and eat.
ash m.}New York, NY}0}12}0}-1}5}3/24/2011}amazing curry.  on that cold NYC day this is the perfect remedy! warms u all over! I love the seafood or chicken curry options. the portions are just right and it's only $10-15. and a Sapporo is $4! it's a very small place so u will be at the bar and it's tight but the service is very fast and friendly. this is a wonderful place, a must try! cash only though but it wont burn a hole in ur wallet.
Wayne W.}REGO PARK, NY}39}119}56}-1}4}3/23/2011Updatedreview}Went there yesterday for my second time. Still great curry, but i ordered the hamburger curry with cheese this time. It is not that good as the berkshire pork curry, a little disappointed, but definitely will come back again for more while I visiting East Village.
Jme G.}Zürich, Switzerland}243}399}177}-1}5}3/21/2011}I didn't know Japanese curry existed, but now I'll surely never forget it! Classic beef was delicious- great starter for newbies. I also recommend the Japanese soda- you open it uniquely! Both of their sakes were affordable and good. Service is quick and friendly- like it should!
Trent C.}New York, NY}10}114}7}-1}3}3/18/2011}3.5 stars. This is good stuff.  I had Berkshire pork cutlet and it was great.  I loved how crisp the pork was.  At $15 this was a bit pricey (for the portion size and what you get - e.g. I would expect a salad at this price) hence 3.5 - if it was a bit cheaper I'd give it a 4
Jason K.}Chula Vista, CA}27}28}20}-1}4}3/9/2011}Curry, rice, don-katsu.... Nothinf else to say
Jo D.}New York, NY}7}22}1}-1}4}3/2/2011}This is my favorite Japanese Curry place on the East side... It's clean- the interior AND the food- the Katsu doesn't feel as greasy as many other places...It's really affordable... it's not time-consuming... so just try it... like... really... it wont take much on your part to do so....
Billy D.}Brooklyn, NY}6}5}0}-1}3}3/1/2011}Pretty good. A bit pricey for just curry. Fun bathroom with a Japanese toilet robot.
Janice L.}Los Angeles, CA}101}499}629}18}5}3/1/2011}Small cozy place to have Japanese curry! Cute and tasty! Ordered their seafood curry with medium spicy (could be a little spicier), my friends ordered the beef curry and they were both delicious!!! Cute place where the cook cooks in front of you. This place is a hit!!!
Ginny L.}New York, NY}51}371}35}-1}4}2/18/2011}I have never tried Japanese Curry before...so this was something new! My gf and I came here tonight...and was surprised the place wasnt packed...SCORED! This place is modern, clean and another hole in the wall....=P I had the Katsu (Pork Cutlet) Curry...while my gf had the Vegetable one and she ordered a salad on the side...as for our drinks we ordered Mango Lassi...which was amazing! =) My katsu curry was good...the katsu was on a thin side, but still crispy, it went well with the curry. The curry was rich but not over board like indian curry...i liked it so much that i really wanted to order the sauce to go just so i can eat it with rice at home....lol...My gf loved her salad and her vegetable curry as well....definitely would come back again to try other items on the menu....Note: The vegetable curry only comes with vegetable curry sauce...there is no shrimp tempura and hamburger that goes with the curry...the picture was deceiving......lol...Note #2: Cash OnlyNote #3: Portion is on the small side..so if you are a big eater...you might not be full....XD
Jay K.}Paramus, NJ}126}16}0}-1}4}2/16/2011}After hearing weeks of hype from friends, I finally tried it......and they're right.  This place is goooooooood.I had the classic.
Dennis L.}Milpitas, CA}237}54}4}-1}5}2/15/2011}To be honest, it's one of my favorite curry places ever. Before walking in, you can tell that this place is quite small and will only sit approximately 20 people. The decorations are quite modern and all the seats surround the stove area like a bar. Wait staff is really friendly and you can watch them cook everything right in front of you. All of the curry they make is really fresh and you can always add on extras to your curry, such as a croquette on the side.Personally, my favorite dish, Hayashi rice, isn't even a curry but still quite delicious all the same. If you're looking for comfort food in the form of curry, Curry-ya is definitely the place to go.
Tricia R.}New York, NY}62}82}0}-1}5}2/4/2011}I've only had (very mediocre) Japanese curry once prior to my visit at Curry-Ya yesterday, so I didn't have much to compare it to, but all I can say is Curry-Ya is definitely doing something right.  I ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet curry, which was $12.  It isn't cheap comparatively speaking, and the meat portion isn't huge (though perfect for me), but quality is definitely there in both the curry and the pork.  They serve the curry separately in a piping hot stone pot, and the amount they give you is actually very generous.  I completely soaked all of my rice and poured all over on top of the pork and still had a good amount of curry left over.  I'll have to try Go Go Curry and other good curry places to determine if Curry-Ya is worth the price or not, but as far as I'm concerned, Curry-Ya is great, and I really have nothing to complain about.
Alice T.}San Francisco, CA}310}33}0}-1}3}1/29/2011}I got the Chicken Katsu with extra hot Curry and my friend got the Pork Cutlet for lunch. The curry was not bad, but little "bland" compared to other Japanese curries I have had. I thought the meat and rice portion was a little small.It did however come with a complimentary salad. Bill was 31 dollars including tips/taxes-- pretty pricy for a small portion.The place is pretty tiny, probably can fit about 10 people- so probably not a good place for groups. The restaurant itself is very clean and neat. They have nice art pieces and one of those interesting personal cleansing Japanese toilets. :D , fun to go see if you havent seen them before haha.Not sure if I ll come back, maybe if I am around the area.
Ness C.}Brooklyn, NY}4}132}0}-1}5}1/29/2011}loved it! this place is nice...narrow, but nice. i got the seafood dish. the curry here is very creamy and tasty, and i like the yummy little salad that's included! i gotta say, i do like go go curry too. this place is a little more on the fancy side of them. will be back!
Lawrence C.}New York, NY}328}290}5}-1}5}1/27/2011}Had the pork cutlet curry, extra spicy.  It was not spicy enough, i'll ask for more spice next time.  Everything was done perfectly.  The curry's flavoring was surprisingly more robust than most Japanese curry's.  It isn't as sweet as most other places, which in my opinion is a great thing.Hard to find anything to complain about.
Dan W.}Forest Hills, NY}8}10}0}-1}5}1/25/2011}Yummy curry katsu, friendly waitress and happy hour 1/2 off drinks makes this place worth going... but this is not for the "big boned" people! Everything is super tight... I'm not a big guy and I find it hard to get around in there... but I can see its appeal
Jennifer N.}New York, NY}9}69}0}-1}5}1/18/2011}My relationship with curry has always been iffy.  I wasn't a big fan, I could eat it, but would order something else if there were other options.  Going to Curry-Ya this weekend changed all that.I ordered the seafood curry in regular spicy.  The curry was served in a nice genie-bottle shaped metal container.  The portion of seafood that was in the curry was small (a shrimp, scallop, and few pieces of squid).  And the rice was served on a large flat plate.  I poured the curry over my rice and took a bite.  Wow!  For some reason, this curry just clicked with me.  I found it to be really tasty and devoured my rice and finished the remaining curry.  :PPartner got the pork cutlet with very hot curry sauce, he enjoyed his meal and found it to be pretty tasty as well.  Place is small and kind of cramped with counter seating only.  There are hooks on the wall to hang your coats.  It is a cash only establishment. Curry-Ya is the kind of curry I like, definitely will be back for more.  They do delivery too if you live in the East Village area.
Adam C.}RIDGEWOOD, NY}17}69}3}-1}4}1/10/2011}small plce nice staff delicious curry !!!! even my really picky friend who has nothing but spanish food his whole life ( and is reluctant to try anything else  loves the curry at this place!!
Julia Y.}Manhattan, NY}28}70}25}-1}4}1/7/2011}This is a tiny place, but well worth the visit if you're a fan of curry.  I ordered the vegetable curry (hot).  I also added the croquette as a side.  I wish I had tried more toppings, but that could be something to think about for next time.  My friend had warned me that the rice portions were really small.  I thought they were just right.
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}126}25}1}-1}4}12/12/2010}a very cute little japanese curry place. the menu is small, as it sticks strictly to curry, but the curry is delicious and they have all the basic  japanese curry dishes (pork katsu, beef/potato/carrot, plain). they also offer several variations, that are equally delicious and worth trying. and if you'd like, they have a great selection of toppings to choose from as well; think raw or boiled egg, mini chicken/pork cutlets, or natto. my personal favorites are the pork katsu (their berkshire pork cutlet is perfection!) and the seafood curry (sounds weird, but it's very good), both extra hot. i find their curry to be a little creamier and sweeter than your typical japanese curry, but it's lightly sweet in that creamy way, and it's wonderful. i like my curry spicy, and am not a big fan of "sweet" outside of dessert, but i love their curry. it's simply delicious and definitely worth a try. also, i love how neat and clean everything is!note: it is very small (about 12 seats or so at a counter) and cash only.
Lily T.}Emeryville, CA}120}274}458}-1}5}12/11/2010}I can summarize Curry-Ya in a few key points:1) NOT for large groups2) Counter seating only3) Cash only4) Clean, neat, cute5) Simple, but DElicious
Scott L.}San Francisco, CA}411}45}1}-1}4}12/2/2010}CURRY-YA HAI-YA!!that's how excited i am for this place. ok, like every other review i've written about places in NYC, i have to have a point of comparison to my old hood, LA. this place definitely ain't Curry House, but i give it props for being my go-to spot when i have a curry fix i need to satiate.i can only speak to 2 items that i've ordered here -- the hamburger curry, and the half-and-half lunch special (both under $14 after tax+tip!) HAMBURGER CURRY - pretty damn tasty! the burger patty isn't as big as other places i've been to, but i guess that's why (japanese) NY'ers aren't as fat as say, LA. the curry is served to you in a little stone pot, so you really get to control how much curry you saturate your rice and meat with. another plus is that they give you unlimited condiments (dried chopped garlic and red ginger) to make your meal tasty tasty tasty....LUNCH SPECIAL - it wasn't that memorable, but they basically let you choose 2 items from the menu, so you get more variety in your meal. it costs about the same as a regular meal, so all you're really paying for is variety. i got the dried beef and original curry. i had enough to take home for lunch the next day, so that's pretty awesome too if you're into portioning like me.if you haven't given it a try, i highly recommend it. just make sure you're not going in a group of more than 4, because seating is basically an L-shaped counter, and unless you like to talk over (and possibly spit into the food of) others, then groups of 1 or 2 would be ideal.
R K.}New York, NY}0}49}0}-1}3}12/1/2010}this is a cute small clean looking place.  you sit at the bar to eat and can pretty much see your food being cooked.  the curry has a clean taste.  nothing spectacular but a cute place to stop by and worthwhile to try at least once.
Gloria G.}New York, NY}41}22}0}-1}4}11/18/2010}small modern hole in the wall, well lit with marble countertops with literally 15 seats. i got the hot curry with breaded pork cutlets & was simply amazed.  and when i say hot, it's not hot like indian curry -- it was actually mild. order with a croquette [there are other sides as well] :-) the seafood curry was pretty good too, but as with most seafood dishes in general, there's not enough seafood. the pork cutlets are a winnerrrr!! *yum CASH ONLY, go to the ATM beforehand!
Thomas C.}Houston, TX}336}27}1847}-1}4}11/1/2010}I'm a huge curry fan, so I was pretty psyched to go to this restaurant.  I got the dried beef curry and it was delicious.  The house salad was really nce and light.  They curry wasnt a huge portion, but it was good enough to fill me up.  The egg and onions on top are a perfect complement, but if I were to do it again, I'd get it without raisins.
Philip C.}Brooklyn, NY}10}11}0}-1}5}10/24/2010}I love this place. It is very small but cozy. The food is good (curry yum.......) Portions are a bit small but it taste good so its fair. Drinking sake with curry is amazing. All I say is try the Japanese toilet. you wont be dissapointed
coolidgedecides o.}New York, NY}292}21}0}-1}4}10/12/2010}In a word, dericious! Fairly cheap and delicious group to be had throughout the day at this cozy po-mo japanese counter bar. I got the beef curry, reminiscent of the Indian dish Keema Matar but less beef and sweet raisins for $8 w small salad. Delicious w added spice and very filling! I'm definitely going back to try more. They have pork katsu, chicken, shrimp and vegie option.Yes, the toilet is also v cool and worth a look too.
Derrick M.}Syosset, NY}18}24}8}-1}4}9/14/2010}This place is simple. So my review is simple. Berkshire Pork cutlet curry, and a Sapporo end of story. Great God Damn Curry have it and you'll be hooked for life
Kevin E.}New York, NY}0}20}0}-1}5}9/2/2010}I praise the day i found this little gem. Great curry at the right price. Its my go-to place for hangover comfort food. Hmm....thinking about it - i cant wait to be hungover again.
Helen S.}New York, NY}4}11}0}-1}5}8/26/2010}i've been to curry-ya 3x's in the past 3 weeks. The curry has a ton of flavor and blows boxed curry out of the water. Every dish is carefully prepared in front of you. the chicken katsu + pork katsu are super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. the bar attitude is relaxed and afterwards for dessert i walk down the street to chickalicious.
Yolanda L.}Brooklyn, NY}143}181}29}-1}4}8/9/2010}Took a few bites of my friend's classic curry with chicken katsu and the special Hayashi Rice which is a brown "curry" with mushrooms, onions and beef.  I put curry in quotations because it really isn't a curry but tasted like the love child of beef stroganoff and beef stew.  Good, not great but definitely not a curry.Their classic curry with the deep fried chicken cutlet is the way to go.  Will definitely be back for that.  The chicken was lightly breaded and crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and they give you a side of classic curry sauce to ladle on yourself.  Mmmm... I love sauce so this is my kinda place.  Definitely delicious.Haven't tried enough items on the menu but I also ordered a glass of green tea and was no disappointed.  I love Japanese green tea and the stronger the better.  Curry-Ya got it just right so it's legit in my eyes :)
Wai Sze Z.}Flushing, NY}110}145}14}-1}4}8/2/2010}We are huge fans of curry - Indian and Japanese.  I love that this place specializes in Japanese Curry.  Our orders included: Yuba Salad - love yuba so I automatically liked this right away athough I could have just eaten this plain without the parmesan which gave it an odd taste in my mouth.  Artfully arranged too.Berkshire Pork Cutlet Curry - not as great as what I've had in Japan, but hey we're in NYC and this was definitely a winnerBeef Dried Curry - As recommended by fellow Yelpers and I can certainly see why.  It had just the right amount of spice (asked for Extra Hot) and went perfectly with rice.  (leftovers tasted great!)Portions are generous & price for our meal wasn't bad at all.  Just keep in mind that this restaurant is very small. A nice quick date is recommended.  We were lucky & went when it was empty.  I'm sure it gets busy though.  Very clean,  bar styled seating with stools that have cubbies for all your belongings (nice touch) and unfortunately we missed out on the Toto bathrooms.   There will be a next time for sure.
Lorelei D.}New York, NY}60}1170}1133}-1}3}7/27/2010}Really liked the presentation (molded rice and the string beans). My curry could have been spicier, but I know that I can go off the hook with that. Loved the pork cutlet and the croquette. I'd like to try the deep-fried chicken thigh when I go back.
May P.}New York, NY}3}4}0}-1}3}7/24/2010}I went to Curry-Ya to try the dry beef curry. The place is clean but quite cramped. Fortunately, at the time I went there, there was only a couple eating near the window , and I was the only one seated at the bar.The dry beef curry was good and tasted like home cooked food. The presentation of the dish was creative--sliced thin strips of bacon and boiled egg arranged in a swirl.  But I wasn't too impressed and would still search for a different place that may serve better Japanese curry.
Naoko I.}New York, NY}2}45}0}-1}2}7/19/2010}Curry roux was little powderly to me. Rice and Pork Cutlet was good.
L C.}San Francisco, CA}4}44}0}-1}4}7/12/2010}Yum! Stopped in for a quick lunch (i actually planned on going to rai rai ken next door, but curry-ya caught my eye and i couldn't help myself).  At $8 for the Japanese classic (beef and vegetables) it's not too pricey, and enough to make me very full.  Maybe not the best curry in the world (hey! it's new york, not tokyo!) but tasty nonetheless.  Not a bad lunch option!
Tassamai s.}Queens, NY}167}238}73}-1}3}7/9/2010}I love curry and I like my curry SPICY! I saw that you could order hot or extra hot. Being Thai and knowing when you ask for extra hot food you're going to have a five alarm fire in your mouth. So having this understanding, I thought today was not the day to have a five alarm fire in my mouth so I got the hot. The hot was not hot, it was mild for me. The curry took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. I drank my $4 Saporo and chatted with my friend and a friendly patron. The place was packed (yes they only have about 10 stools and the place is small). When our food came out the place was empty! my pork cutlet was crispy and hot the curry was boiling and he rice looked like a football. I happily ate my food and wished it was spicier but I know for next time.
Jenny C.}New York, NY}83}586}516}18}4}7/9/2010}Oh how I love my japanese curry! The dishes are always constructed with care and precision. How can a plate of rice and toppings be so artfully crafted you ask? It's all in the presentation, and with the Japanese, not only do they feed your tummy, but also the eyes! They don't just plop a helping of rice onto the plate. It's sculpted perfectly into the shape of a small football neatly next to your desired topping. Today I had the Hamburger curry. My friend had the traditional pork cutlet. Being Thai, we requested our curry HOT, but it wasn't that hot haha. We'll try extra hot next time :) It's so tasty I finished everything on my plate (only to regret the huge pile of rice that now sits heavily in my stomach). CurryYa is a cash-only joint, and it seats about 10 at the counter. Service is speedy, friendly, and efficient! Stop in for a tasty meal :)
Ellen M.}Brooklyn, NY}64}41}35}-1}4}7/5/2010}I just discovered my new favorite curry restaurant in NY today!  I actually like this place better than Curry House in SoCal. I tried seasonal vegetable curry with corn topping.  I really liked how sweetness of corn, squash, carrot and potatoes are well blended with delicious yet not overpowering curry sauce.  Curry-Ya's sauce is rich and complex yet doesn't feel as heavy as Curry House's.  I will definitely go back to try croquetto and hamburger toppings.
Alice T.}Manhattan, NY}281}222}185}-1}3}6/9/2010}Over-rated and over-priced! The place is cute.  Bar styled seating.  I ordered the lychee lassi and the chicken katsu curry.  The chicken was cooked really well but the curry is really average.  It's not something you can't make at home.  It's good don't get me wrong but I feel like I can make it at home.  The lychee lassi was really good.  It's a good blend of yogurt and flavor.  However, do not mix that with curry because my stomach wasn't feeling so great after eating curry and drinking lassi.
pisa w.}New York, NY}3}9}12}-1}4}6/8/2010}I love this place.  It's a place you can go alone or bring alone your friends (not too many though since it's so tiny).The prices are really reasonable.  And the portions are enough to fill my tummy.  My favorite is the pork cutlet curry rice.  The pork is always crispy and not greasy.  And just the right amount of fat in it.  The beef dried curry is also very good.  I didn't expect to like it that much the first time I had it so it was a good surprise (and it's like $8... wow!)If you go for lunch, you get a salad with your dish.  If you go in the afternoon - early evening (I don't remember when), it's happy hour with all drinks 50% off.  Great deal.And you can always go get a dessert at Chikalicious on the same block.  :)
Melody H.}New York, NY}178}286}0}-1}4}6/6/2010}YUM! And really reasonably priced, too. $8 for the classic beef, carrot, potato, pumpkin, and green bean curry - and it was perfectly spicy at the "extra hot" level. The beef in the curry was only okay; a little tough for having been stewed in curry, but the amazing pumpkin bits more than compensated for that. I ordered the mini-hamburger for an extra $3, and that was the perfect accompaniment to the curry. Everything was nicely presented, too, which is saying something when it comes to curry. I would definitely go again, and next time I'll get the pork tonkatsu cutlet curry with corn - the guy next to me was having it and it looked DELISH. During happy hour 4-7 pm, Sapporo is $2.
Tessy M.}Astoria, Queens, NY}4}26}0}-1}4}5/30/2010}I went there on the way to go to a theater on St. Marks. I had to really rush because the theater would begin in 20 min.The food came in 5 min, and finished eating in 15 min. That was the quickest dinner I ever had.The seafood curry I got was delicious! Japanese ladies who work there were very nice and polite. Need to go back there! Wish there were more seats.
Goaty P.}New York, NY}2}41}0}-1}3}5/27/2010}I'm a curry freak and I cook pots of it at home. When I heard that a curry shop was opening, I rushed over there.Pros:1. Chunky dried garlic flakes (really flavorful - not that processed sh*t)2. Savory CurryCons:1. Too much butter2. Tiny portions3. $15 for curry?4. One of the Mexican dudes cooked my meal (is he the chef?)
John W.}New York, NY}5}16}0}-1}4}5/21/2010}I like the berkshire pork cutlet curry here.  Always satisfying, always delicious.   It's a small cramped space, but very clean and the service is welcoming and gracious.  There are so many good restaurants in this area, this one is a particularly good place to stop by for a quick meal by yourself or with a friend.
Thompson L.}New York, NY}223}541}302}-1}4}5/2/2010}If I have not had tonkatsu in Japan I would have given this 5 stars.  The berkshire pork cutlet is key here.  I would have enjoyed the pork to be a little more fatty but the light crisp and flavor was there.  The curry itself was nice and spicy in its own hot iron pot.  This was great for ppl that like to dip or spread the curry evenly.  I liked it because it didn't make my katsu soggy!  Nice little place... the wait staff was very friendly and the food was excellent...what more could I ask for?  I would Definitely come back.
Alex M.}New York, NY}0}12}1}-1}4}4/21/2010}Having recently moved back to NY after almost 5 years in Tokyo I have been avoiding most Japanese places in NY. Not b/c they're not good but b/c I wanted to forget how good the places were in Tokyo. But today I was hungry and in the area and suddenly the idea of Japanese curry sounded like a good idea. The two Japanese employees were extremely nice. The place was very clean and the food was perfect. It was a Japan flashback for me. I had Pork Tonkatsu (friend pork cutlet) which came with a perfect little salad. I'm already trying to find time to go back.
David G.}Lakeside, VA}73}20}0}-1}4}4/20/2010}curry is one of the japeanse foods i really like, and this is really a cut above. the whole point is that everything served is perfectly fresh and made that minute, from scratch, down to the carrots and green beans. i imagine it's a lot like what a curry would be at a four-star japanese restaurant: very true to its form, with a little bit less of the ingredients than you'd expect at a fast food restaurant. yes, i could eat three of them, but one is really the right size meal anyway.
Linh D.}New York, NY}23}66}0}-1}4}3/29/2010}reminded me to japan. I ordered the Hamburger curry b/c I wanted the meat. It was delicious. Just enough ratio for curry to rice. You get a choice of how spicy you want it. I'd definitely go back, or better yet, just have it delivered. it gets 4 stars for being cheap, good and satisfying my hunger needs.
Jennie K.}Washington, DC}0}35}0}-1}4}3/19/2010}Ambiance: A hole-in-the-wall type of a restaurant but clean. The place is very narrow and long. There are maybe less than 20 seats along the counter and small window area. Food: Seafood curry was good!Service: Decent, especially since you are sitting right in front of the staff at the bar.
Jane F.}New York, NY}17}179}0}-1}5}3/14/2010}this place has everything i need: counter dining, beer, pickles, lots of silly toppings, and an incredible bathroom. THE destination for japanese toilet connoisseurs.
Christoff F.}New York, NY}12}125}17}-1}4}3/10/2010}the only japanses curry house in town, it is a no brainier when I got the itch. the curry is sweet and just the right viscosity. there is enough for a meal but if you are a big eater you can get a dbl dose for $3 more.The Yuba salad is also very good, made with yuba (tofu) skin, green beans and parmesan cheese.Although the menu is small, they do have combination specials. Perhaps the small menu is not to their detriment though but rather allows them to focus on making the menu items they do have consistent and delicious
Linh N.}Brooklyn, NY}169}540}1462}-1}3}2/15/2010}I was never a fan of curry but Japanese curry certainly changed my mind. This place got different kinds of curry with different levels of "hotness" for your satisfaction. A regular, hot, extra hot... I chose regular since I'm a wuss at spicy food lolSalad - taste light and fresh with the perfect different greens put together. drizzled with a light vinaigrette, perfect little appetizer ready for your tummyVegetable Curry over Rice - the rice was in a football shape so I had to mash it down so my curry can just lay on it =] the thickness of the curry was pretty ok, no so think or watery. I had some potatoes, string beans, carrots, and squash... but the main focus was on the curry. it was that spicy but when I was halfway through, I started getting hot cause it got a bit spicy for me (told you I'm a wuss). I would come back here again, just because I want to try their Berkshire Pork Curry... the picture look darn well appealing.
Pearl O.}New York, NY}65}142}63}-1}4}12/18/2009}"im pretty sure im in love with our cook." - my dining mate/friendhe's not why this is her fave curry spot, but i can see how he adds to it.  when she ordered the beef dried curry sans raisins, i saw him pick out each and every one out of the premade mixture with his chopsticks*.  my pork katsu curry was deep fried to order, served with a nearly boiling pot of mildly sweet yet savory curry, and tons of white rice.  the service was quick, the food delicious, though the space small - a  sterile yet simply beautiful space comprised of one long bar and high stools; it gets awkward when it's packed inside and youre trying to leave.  even more awkward when you drop your spoon on the floor in the middle of the meal when every seat is taken.  try finding space to move your chair so you can bend down to grab it.  yeah, not happening.  my friend's new love appeared from out of nowhere to pick it up for me.  not my fave curry joint, but ill be returning.*she didnt.  and i didnt tell her until after we walked out of the joint, so she could freak out out of his view when she fell even more in love with him.
Y S.}El Segundo, CA}8}107}0}-1}4}12/13/2009}If you are looking for some Japanese style curry in the East Village area, this is a good option.  The ingredients are of high quality although the curry was a little creamier than what I prefer.  I wish they had some more size options.  It may not be enough for those with hearty appetites.  For better Bang for Your Buck curry, try Tatany 72.
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}4}11/17/2009}Surgically clean yet cute and cozy, Curry-Ya is quintessentially Japanese.  Busy chefs offer businesslike service from across the counter.  Come for the curry, not for the pampering.The menu is simple and dedicated to the venerable food group that is Japanese curry.  Prices are reasonable and the food is satisfying.  I went with a friend for a quick, casual dinner and it was just what we were looking for.  I ordered the extra spicy seafood curry and she got the medium spicy hamburger.  I have a near pathological preference for spicy foods, so take this with a grain of salt and maybe a drink of water, but I would definitely recommend the extra spicy.  My friend agreed that it had a lot more shine without leaving the range of palatability.  The hamburger was good, but the seafood was better with a delightful mix of shrimp, scallop, and squid.  Rice came plated in a handy donut shape waiting to be filled and covered with curry.  Without explanation, a side of raisins accompanied both dishes, and we were provided with pickled radish and garlic.  I'm of the opinion that pickled radish is an essential enhancer to curry so I requested a couple refills, which were granted in due time.I doubt that I would go out of my way for this place, but curry isn't exactly special occasion food.  Curry-Ya is a great neighborhood restaurant, easy and tasty and plausibly priced, and I would probably go all the time if I lived in the area.
Jack F.}Austin, TX}85}29}10}-1}3}11/2/2009}Small cozy place with a direct view of their efficient kitchen. Their curry was that of a typical Japanese curry, mild in both spiciness and flavor. I had the Berkshire pork katsu and it was about average. The pork is thick cut, tender, and juicy, but a bit chewy with tendons. The major attraction in the restaurant is ironically their toilet. Their fully automatic toilet, with a controls to raise the lid and/or seat, offered me much amusement in an otherwise cramped establishment. Next time I pass by, I'll definitely go in to borrow their washroom.
Riki K.}New York, NY}14}48}14}-1}3}10/24/2009}My favorite is the hamburger curry at this small and tucked away japanese curry bar. It would get 4 stars if the portions weren't so small given the prices. However, i haven't found too many places serving quality Japanese curry so this place is a treat.Don't forget to throw in a Croquette.....It's like crispy tofu but with potato filling instead.
Carmen K.}San Francisco, CA}347}258}15}-1}4}10/23/2009}I went to this random Japanese Curry House after stopping by Ippudo a few blocks away since it looked like it was being mobbed by angry east villagers. This restaurant is tucked away with other japanese restaurants including Rei Rei Ken and Shabu Tatsu. The restaurant itself is just a bar along the open kitchen. The menu is simple - just various curries. I went with the Pork since it was recommended. They make everything right in front of you so you know what's going on which makes me feel better about any department of sanitation issues. The food itself was pretty good - pork cutlets with some delicious curry sauce over rice. My japanese friend gave it the two thumbs up of approval so I guess it was pretty right on. The best part was the bathroom. HEATED toilet seat. HEATED. I love weird japanese gadgets but this may take the cake. I want to get installed at my apartment.
Mairead R.}Sacramento, CA}290}256}28}-1}3}10/18/2009}E 10th between 1st and 2nd is an enclave of tiny, energetic japanese restaurants. You've got sushi, cakes, teriyaki, and this simple curry counter. Curry-Ya has one server, one cook, and a gleaming white counter with stools. That's it. Oh, and  a heated toilet seat! Its minimal and feels like you've ducked through the looking glass to a tokyo businessman's joint. They serve your curry in a silver gravy bowl alongside a plate of rice, molded like a bundt cake. (It comes with salad too.) The curry sauce was a good texture but lacked adequate fillings, just a few carrots, beans, potatoes, and some beef. Tasted good, especially with the nice atmosphere. A good stop in the chain of E 10th japanese restaurants.
Mr. S.}New York, NY}9}143}3}-1}2}10/11/2009}Meh.Heard so much about this place. Don't come  looking for any other Japanese fare, for this joint remains true to its name. Curry, curry and more curry. With that said, for a place that specializes in the stuff, it's quite ordinary. I ordered the mixed seafood, and specified 'hot'. I received a mini-bundt-shaped ring of steamed rice, with a small side pot of curry. The idea is you ladle the contents of the curry pot over the rice donut.After a few bites of the dish, slowly excavating it's contents, I realized that there was no fish parts to be found. Huh?I asked the waiter whom took my order and he said, well, you're right, I gave you the vegi curry. OK then.11 bucks. Hard stool at counter. Spicy curry that's not. Small portions.
Sonia C.}Seattle, WA}408}864}61}-1}3}9/29/2009}Like brownies, Japanese curry is just as good from the mix as made from scratch.  The curry at Curry-Ya, though silky smooth and flavorful, is really something that you can make at home for a fraction of the price.  The only exception is if you get the curry with berkshire pork katsu since most people can't deep-fry at home.  However, most people do have the ability to cut up chunks of chicken or beef, some vegetables, and add them to boxed curry sauce.Portions aren't very big but they are satisfying if you aren't super duper hungry.  Service is good.  Prices are affordable in the sense that you don't have to pay more than $20 for dinner, but you can make the same thing yourself at home for maybe $2.  Sort of like how a brownie at Fat Witch is $2.75 but you can make the same thing yourself for $0.25.
Jim U.}Washington, DC}669}1303}3042}-1}3}9/26/2009}Japanese curry lunch for a mere $8.  While not extraordinary fare, it is worth a look at this price point.  My meal came with a small salad, a plate of rice, a pitcher of beef curry, and a side of dried onions and radish.  The salad was pedestrian and regrettable.  It was overly acidic, and the dressing accumulated in the bottom of the dish.  However, the curry was quite good.  I took it to be extra hot, but the heat was only very mild.  The flavor was complex, and the sauce had a very smooth quality to it.  The beef soaked up the flavor wonderfully.  The vegetables in the sauce accented the dish well.  Very nice.  And the lunch special is a good deal, because changing out the protein in the curry will change the price to $15.  Good place for the budget conscious.  3 stars
Eric T.}Los Angeles, CA}24}87}5}-1}3}9/16/2009}Unique atmosphere with decent curry.Food:  The curry was not bad, but I felt it was a little thin and lacking in the typical vegetables you find in curry (potatoes, carrots, onions, etc.).  The portions were on the small side, but not ridiculous.Atmosphere:  Tiny place, but really interesting in the fact that they are literally cooking RIGHT in front of you.
Isabel L.}New York, NY}257}406}91}-1}3}9/10/2009}When you have to eat  Japanese curry sitting on a high stool And pay 15 bucks for it, its hard to justify coming here unless it's an 8 dollar lunch special.I stopped by today to see what was so " Magical" behind their curry.The obvious( *nudge* economical) choice would be to opt for the lunch special. Today's special was the curry beef with carrots, pumpkin and potatoes.The curry had a very thick yet smooth texture that was mildly addicting. There was definitely some ooomph to the curry. The downfall was the beef cubes. It tasted like it was off  a fat part of the cow's butt. Let's just say I didn't eat one piece of the beef but i was able to do just fine with the curry sauce and vegetables.OVERALL:*Decent curry, but overly small portions and overpriced* the male waiters were really sweet but there was a female waiter that wasn't very pleasant.  She just cleared my table without asking and no Thank you's after I  left her tip. Learn some manners biaatchh!!
patrick c.}New York, NY}181}211}39}-1}3}8/6/2009}I LOVE JAPANESE curry and can eat it every single day. Ive  heard so much about curry ya and read all kinds of articles about it so obviously i was extremely excited to finally make it over for a taste. UNFORTUNATELY i was greatly disappointed. The food is alright... but for the price id say its a huge rip off. The portions are outrageously small. this "gourmet" was somewhat tasteless. the presentation was superb though. No doubt about that. Presentation it gets a 5 star. the rice was NOT sticky or sticker like how it is in japan. GO GO curry is still the best japanese curry place in the city.
JP E.}Larchmont, NY}8}43}3}-1}4}7/28/2009}On a cold February day, nothing could satisfy me more than a place of Japanese curry.  I give this place 3.5-4 stars depending on the wait.  This place is good and relatively cheap but ts small so you might have to wait.  The curry here is the closest i've had to the curry in Tokyo.  The pork curry over rice is my S&*T!
Junkfoodie Q.}NY, NY}12}372}0}-1}4}7/21/2009}3.75 stars.  I'm really not much of a curry person, but we came here on recommendation of T's friend.  I ordered the croquette (with ground beef and potato) curry, and T ordered the Berkshire pork cutlet curry.  Tiny bowls of ginger, shallots, and onion flakes accompanied each of our orders.  I got two croquettes with a mound of rice with a hole in the middle.  The curry came in a separate bowl, and I spooned as much curry I wanted into the hole, routinely adding the ginger, shallots, onion flakes to my taste.  It was kinda fun!  I ordered my curry regular (you can also order it hot and extra hot) and the hotness was just right for me (not hot at all, please).  The croquettes were just crispy enough on the outside, tender with the potato and ground beef (not too much of either) on the inside.  T's Berkshire pork cutlet was a tad too dry and bland for me.  They also have a happy hour special from 4-7 pm where all drinks (not including alcohol) are 50% off.  Another special is if you order a bowl of curry, for $6 more you can also get a "special appetizer" of the day and choice of drink.  Depending on the drink, it may just be cheaper anyway to go with the happy hour special.Tiny place with just stools to sit at around a counter facing the kitchen so you can watch your food being made.
Tan C.}New York, NY}9}43}0}-1}4}7/21/2009}I'm generally not a fan of any type of curry in general. The combination of so many spices is not my cup of tea. However, I'm a fan of this place. The place is small and is counter type service. Dishes were well presented and the waitress was very kind to explain/enlighten me to the little toppings that come with the curry. Since the menu said that the berkshire pork was recommended,  i figured to try it. The pork was very tender and perfectly crisp. The taste was flavorful and well balanced. I especially liked how everything had a clean and fluid presentation. I also tasted the croquette made of ground beef and potatoes. That also deserves two thumbs up, but i prefer the pork. The main star here is the curry. The curry was not overbearing. Almost, dare I say addicting? It was creamy and not too spicy for me (you can tell them your level of spiciness) While I will almost never have a craving for curry. I can definitely see myself wanting curry-ya once in awhile.
Jennifer Z.}ASTORIA, NY}58}14}0}-1}5}7/9/2009}Okay, read that as 4.5 stars because I'm indecisive and yet I hate to be mean and take off an entire star...I really enjoyed Curry-ya -- while small and sure to be crowded later in the evening (I went during a "happy hour" after work), I'd say it would be worth the wait.  Maybe I'm biased because I just love Japanese Curry in general, but their curry was pretty f. bombdiggity (got the veggie curry)...it made me devour that entire huge ring of rice they give you against my will (on top of the delish seaweed salad I had first).  That's the other thing I liked about Curry-ya -- the whole experience, from interior set-up to dish arrangement, was really clean and well presented.  Usually restaurant kitchens look pretty messy, or just have that sheen of grease or SOMEthing, but not so with Curry-ya.  And I loved the cute little pot of dried onion flakes complete with a tiny wooden spoon.  And even the raisin garnish...which I ate...Okay, so basically I really liked Curry-ya.  =)
Mel T.}San Francisco, CA}182}310}818}-1}4}6/24/2009}The bf and I happened upon this place simply because the Shabu restaurant next door we wanted to try (Shabu-tatsu is only open for dinner) was closed.  Ravenous, we knew our appetites could wait no longer and headed straight in.Having just visited Japan late last year, stepping into Curry-Ya was like being back in Japan.  Definitely not an establishment for large parties or groups (the only seating, which faces the narrow cooking space, is at the counter), you'll be immediately greeted by Japanese speaking waitstaff, and you can watch as your food is freshly prepared right before your eyes.  The curry, you ask?  Well, as the bf says, "You really can't go wrong with curry."  Honestly, the food, although tasty, particularly the pork cutlet, and original in its presentation, was nothing to write home about, especially for its price (think around $35 for two unless you spring for a monthly special, which goes for about $10/entree.  The bf thinks this was the best curry he's ever had, but at what we had to shell out for it, it'd have better well be).  Curry-Ya does get its fourth star, however, for its cleanliness, kitschy decor and plateware, and unique restroom (you'll really feel as if you're in Japan - have fun playing with the bidet!!).Bottom line, if you're only visiting NY for a few short days, you can skip over coming here - there are so many other superior restaurant in the Big Apple.  If, however, you're a native New Yorkian, as I like to call them, I wouldn't say no to giving Curry-Ya a try.Oh, yeah, one last thing - before heading into Curry-Ya, grab a takeout menu hanging outside the door.  You may find coupons attached to it (this, to my dismay, happened to me after our meal was already paid for and we had left the restaurant), which will help make your meal feel a little more worth it.
Stephanie L.}San Francisco, CA}78}174}0}-1}3}6/24/2009}yea curry-ya was delicious but why all the fuss over a plate of curry?  the service was slow because they were there like elaborately putting my rice into a little bundt tin to shape it.  i know chinese curry isn't exactly like japanese curry but i grew up eating gigantic platefuls of curry swimming with (can you say swimming with?  well i think you get it) an assortment of vegetable/meat goodies, so curry-ya's carefully prepared presentation seemed a little sterile to me.
Victor T.}Austin, TX}24}225}62}-1}5}6/23/2009}Curry-ya's presentation of a beef or pork cutlet curry dinner is pretty close to what I had experienced in Japan the last time.Today, I tried the lunch special which was a medium serving of beef curry with carrots, pumpkin, green beans, red pepper, and potato. You can get it for $8, but I ordered a side of hamburger (4oz patty) which upped the bill by $3.I was completely full at the end of the meal, although the Japanese fellow next to me managed to go through THREE extra helpings of rice. That skinny dude could eat.Anyways, even though I was there at close to 2 p.m. most of the seats were taken. Luckily, they are open between lunch and dinner so arriving for a late late lunch is not a problem.I highly recommend this place for the quality of the food, flavor, and excellent service....and if you order from the dinner menu you get the smallest serving of Mojave grapes dried on the vine (yum!).
Misa G.}San Francisco, CA}24}82}96}-1}4}6/22/2009}I finally made it down to this itty-bitty place (I had no idea there was a small pocket of japanese restaurants down there! a ramen-ya, curry-ya and teriyaki boy all on the same block!) and got it all to myself for most of my meal.  The curry was excellent, the closest thing to the real thing I've had since I was in Japan, the presentation super cute (a ring of rice for you to pour your curry into, a little jar of garlic flakes, some pickles in small bowls, a tiny sprig of raisins as garnish), and the restaurant was very clean.  I also enjoyed being able to watch the prep happening in the tiny kitchen behind the counter.  I can't give it 5 stars because curry is supposed to be a budget meal and this place is way overpriced, but hey, it's NY.  If you come at lunch the lunch special is a good deal, though.  I've been to Go! Go! Curry, and maybe it was just a bad batch but the curry was too strong there, as if they didn't dilute their curry bricks enough.  This was definitely the best curry I've had in the city, even if it was on the pricey side.
Patrick L.}Oakland Gardens, NY}38}11}6}-1}3}6/12/2009}Honestly, I'd give this 3.5 stars.While tasty, it IS pricey.. $39.xx for two (I had the Berkshire pork cutlet, she had the seafood, and we both hand lychee lassi's), not including tip. Service was good, bonus points that the waitress/cashier/manager was cute (but don't tell my gf I said that!).While I wouldn't mind going back here once in awhile, GO! GO! Curry still ranks above this. I just wish they'd (G!G!C) open one up in Chinatown.. I'd eat there every day. ;)Oh, the lychee lassi was more like "yogurt with a hint of lychee". It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I was expective from a lassi. And @ $4, not cheap.. !As others have stated, the curry wasn't anything better than the stuff you can get a couple blocks away from the Sunrise Mart. And the place is MAD tiny.. less room than Rai-Rai Ken, and that's saying a lot.
Christine F.}New York, NY}11}79}0}-1}3}6/1/2009}On my way to Momofuku and then back again to Chikalicious Dessert Club, I have passed by Curry-ya many a time. Finally, a couple weeks ago I stopped in to taste what they deem to be "gourmet curry."Upon entering Curry-ya, I couldn't help but feel a bit of deja-vu. The decor certainly takes a page out of David Chang's Momofuku playbook. But to be fair, lots of restaurants are copying his style including Mercadito Cantina.It's the Chang signature clean counter, flat wooden stools and open kitchen - I don't blame them...it certainly seems to work by giving an otherwise casual takeout joint a feeling of freshness that implies it deserves an extra premium.The menu is simple - curry with your choice of protein - anything from Berkshire pork cutlet, organic chicken, to grilled seafood. I chose the Grilled Seafood Curry and requested a medium level of spiciness. Each dish is prepared in the open kitchen and cooked and served in your own personal pot. How cute. But is the cuteness worth the premium?While the curry was tasty, I am not sure my taste buds are advanced enough to really discern a true differentiation from the Golden Curry packs I have been making since college. And at $16 bucks, I expected more than just 1 shrimp, 2 scallops and a couple pieces of squid.While Curry-ya definitely has a certain level of charm not found in most fast-food curry joints...the food falls a little short given its relatively high price point. Unfortunately it does not taste that different from the offerings your neighborhood takeout place offers.As an alternative...walk to 3rd Avenue and pick up some cheap Golden Curry packs from m2m. At that low price point you can afford to go crazy on some fresh seafood from Whole Foods and you got yourself a meal.
Vincent N.}Brooklyn, NY}155}121}1893}-1}4}5/29/2009}The curry is very good here and I like how they separate in a bowl so you can pour it on yourself to prevent the Katsu from getting soggy.  The space is definitely cramped which reminds me of my college dorm room.  It's one of the few places where you can order dark meat katsu chicken on the side to add to the curry dish.The salad was very fresh.I would give it a 4 stars on taste and take 1/2 star away on the price and portion.
Theresa S.}New York, NY}6}17}0}-1}4}5/10/2009}Not much to add here - solid food, yes, slightly expensive for what you get. For some reason I have found myself here in the late afternoon on weekends multiple times and it is completely empty so for those who want to try but don't want to wait it's a great time to go. They also have a special during that time - $8 for the dried curry. Also must try: Yuba salad and the yogurt mousse.
Madhuri I.}New York, NY}290}272}0}-1}3}4/28/2009Updatedreview}I struggled a lot between 2 and 3 stars, and settled on 2.5.Why?Because I found out that they use beef stock in all their curries, even the vegetarian one. Very sweet of them to tell me that on my second visit.So 2.5 stars for letting me know, the yogurt mousse and well, I can't deny that the curry tasted great.Please change the stock to vegetarian and I promise you I'll eat here everyday!
Aram S.}New York, NY}916}35}4}-1}5}4/20/2009}Amazing! One of my favs in NYC. You must give it a try. Even if you dont like traditional curry, I don't, makes me feel sick for days, you will love this place.The small menu, price points and service are amazing for what you get.Sitting a the open kitchen bar is a treat. You never get to see what happens behind the lines in a kitchen anymore.Try to get there early, with only 12-14 seats the place is always packed.I took my 65 year old food snob uper east side mother there last week and she loved it. She's been back twice since with her girl friends and they all love it.Even if your on a diet or veg its worth the wait for a seat at the cozy little bar.Also  try their sister joints next door Shabu Tatsu and Ray Ray ken
James H.}New York, NY}395}119}4}-1}4}4/13/2009}Cute desktop Curry counter part to Rai Rai Ken is small and intimate. You'll literally be sitting elbow to elbow next to someone and I'm guessing the place holds maybe 10 patrons. Only have eaten here once, but I was glad to see a different take on the whole curry experience. Never had a set course for a curry meal before. The berkshire cutlet was fried perfectly and the presentation made the experience that much better. A bit on the pricier side for what it is, I'd visit again, but prefer the nearby Menkutei instead.
Nic B.}Miami Beach, FL}323}517}60}-1}4}4/11/2009}Counter service only with like, 8 seats total.  The snob living deep inside of me was not excited about this at first glance because I wondered if it was one of those awesome NYC "hole in the wall great finds" or one of those "fast foody gross we can do better than this hole in the wall joints."    I was pleasantly surprised.Four of us took up half the restaurant and then another four came in and seemed to join us. I don't know much about Japanese food.  I don't know much about curry.  But I do know that my chicken curry was awesome.  And that we were sitting so close to the people next to us that we exchanged names and one of the gentlemen insisted upon calling me Nicolette, even though my name is not Nicolette.  That was...fun.
Oliver C.}Brooklyn, NY}76}43}1}-1}5}4/10/2009}I've been wanting to eat here for awhile now and honestly, i'm annoyed that i didn't try it sooner!first things first...the bathroom.  now, i've been to japan and have experienced the hand dryer and toilet situations before.  but this one takes the cake, not only is the toilet seat heated, but the lid automatically opens as soon as you walk in!  seriously, awesome.now, what counts....the food.  i have eaten many-o-japanese curry dishes from LA to Tokyo to NY.  this is hands down the best (well, outside of japan anyways).  it is a little more expensive here, but you're definitely getting quality ingredients here.  the curry itself was not as heavy/greasy as i've had at other establishments and had just enough kick to to tickle the back of my throat just a little bit.  i had the "classic curry, " which had chunks of tender beef, pumkin, string beans and potatoes.  seriously, i was impressed.  service was friendly, attentive and fast.  i left very happy and i'm excited to go back!
Forza M.}New York, NY}23}55}0}-1}4}4/8/2009}This place is sweet. From their electronic toilets (imported from Japan!) to their counter style service, I felt like I was in Tokyo. And to top it off, my curry was great. I've ordered different items every time I went to Curry-Ya and I was never disappointed. I end up scraping the bottom of my bowl a bit too fast, wishing there portions were a bit larger. Overall, this place is a good and fun experience. There are a couple other Japanese places in the neighborhood that have similar styles with different levels of success, and I would have to say that Curry-Ya pulls it off well.
Catherine H.}New York, NY}70}80}4}-1}2}4/7/2009}Adding the word "gourmet" as an extra adjective does not automatically imply small portioned, over priced, and selective menu options for Japanese curry.I'm not going to lie, my bf and I staggered into this restaurant when ashiyah was too rowdy with murryhill youngsters and their incessant clanking glasses from their saki-bombing. I also was tempted to go into curry-ya after reading their review from nymag. I should have known better that this "hole in the wall" is just a ploy to attract those willing to be suckered by the atmosphere.I got the hamburger curry (off the recommendation of the waitress/cook)  and my b got the seafood curry. Quite honestly, the seafood was fresh and I did enjoy the interesting combo of hamburger and curry, but NO WAY is it worth $15-16 per dish. The presentation was cute and I liked pouring the curry from the mini pot onto my little well of rice. Frankly, I burned more calories transporting my curry  onto my plate then the entire meal itself.This seems like a place my sister would go to since its overly priced, oppressively trendy, and the proportionately sectioned for a stomach of a 3 year old.Try "golden curry" ( a japanese brand of instant curry) from your local asian supermarket and place over some rice and add chicken or beef. Total cost of your efforts: less than $5......and your belly and wallet will be thanking you.
Joyce S.}Palo Alto, CA}107}313}10}-1}3}3/29/2009}They serve a solid Japanese curry dish here, but the portions could be more generous, especially given the price. This curry isn't the best I've had, and given the prices, I was expecting something more "wow." Solid curry in cute, kitchen/bar type setting. Foods are served in cute pots and such, which add to the pleasantly cozy Japanese experience.Also, more daikon please!
Emi T.}Glenmont, NY}3}107}15}-1}3}3/25/2009}My mom makes better curry.  Okay, so the curry here is good, but I don't think it's worth what they charge for it.  They do put big chunks of veggies and meat in the curry, which I like, but the flavor of the sauce just doesn't do it for me.  And what's up with the teensy little niblets of fukujinzuke and rakkyo they give you?Because Curry-Ya is so small, there are only a few seats that are pretty close together.  As a result, it felt like the guy sitting next to me was invading my personal space.  I couldn't escape from the awkwardness because there was no room for me to shift my stool away from him.I came here twice, and that was enough.
Crystal T.}New York, NY}28}86}0}-1}4}3/17/2009}Put the curry in the hole in the middle of your rice. (I wasn't sure) 3.5 Stars rounded up to 4 because I love Japanese places in the East Village and this little hole in the wall was yummy and hit the spot. The rice was good and the curry was flavored nicely. Boyfriend spent a year living in Japan and, though he's not Japanese or any resemblance of Asian, I trust his opinion on the authenticity of Japanese places 100% and he gave Curry-Ya his "gaijin" seal of approval.
John A.}New York, NY}2}35}2}-1}2}3/9/2009}Live close.  Very nice staff at this hole in the wall.  Unfortunately nothing special.  Price points doom current business model due to recession.  Teryaki boy's tonkatsu pork curry (next door) actually competes well with "Berkshire Pork" marquee menu item.  Call me a philistine, but TB's curry sauce is bettter, darker and earthier with more cumin and less turmeric.  Pork quality (both clasically overcooked) is not an issue. Just saying it like it is.  Wish it wasn't.
Tom C.}New York, NY}102}216}291}18}4}3/3/2009}Curry Ya is a Japanese curry house that is slightly more pricey and upscale. They sport a open kitchen with stools arranged around a counter for customers to eat; there are no tables here. The staff is very friendly and take a lot of care in preparing and presenting their creations. Depending on the time and day you pop in, you might have to wait for a seat. It is cash only and they do deliver.The menu is quite extensive, there are a total of nine different curries to choose from. You can also add a number of curry toppings such as Berkshire pork cutlet, corn, cheese, egg, etc. I had the seasonal vegetable curry ($14) and I also add an extra six bucks for the Curry Ya Set, which got me the chief's daily assortment of appetizers and a choice of beverage or dessert (alcohol not included). The curry was served separately from the rice in an enamel pot that retains heat. The curry roux had good texture and was very flavorful. The appetizers were however, mildly impressive and the dessert was nothing special. I would suggest add more curry toppings rather than getting the Curry Ya Set.I came here for dinner, but I think the real deal is during lunch, where you can get a Japanese classic style curry lunch special with salad for $8 or a Curry Ya Set for $15.
Jawn G.}Brooklyn, NY}4}7}0}-1}5}3/1/2009}Hands down the best Japanese curry in all of NYC and I consider myself a Japanese curry fiend (you can find Vermont Curry and Golden Curry on the shelves in my kitchen).  I eat here once a week, and maybe one more time for lunch.  I seriously love this place.I've tried them all, except the seafood, but I usually roll with the chicken as it's perfectly juicy and tender and delicious.  I just wish there was more of it, but that's just me being greedy.You can get the curry extra hot, but I think hot is the tastiest of the heats.  This isn't indian curry, so don't expect to break a sweat ordering the extra hot.I love their salads too; greens, cucumber, tomatoes, green beans and thin slices of pepper with a tasty vinaigrette.  Simple, but it's a nice counterbalance to the weight of the curry.Going with a group isn't recommended, but is good for bringing a friend or two.  Another plus is if Curry-Ya is busy, there is a competent ramen shop next door and a good shabu-shabu joint just one door beyond that.
George L.}New York, NY}82}135}0}-1}4}2/18/2009}WOW!  The food was super great!  The japanese curry is some of the best I have ever tasted.  I got the Hamburger Curry and my gf got the pork cutlet.  The quality of the meats are good and the rice was nice and the curry was god damn great.  The appetizers I got (seaweed, shrimp, and this other thing... i forgot)  It was all very good.  Dinner special for all that  (plus a non alco drink) was 6 bucks.  Freaking amazing!!!   I was like GTFO is this for real?  I had to be like "so THat That and That for just that?!"  So yeah this place if it was closer I could see myself eating here every day.  The service was GREAT!!!  They were so polite and nice and did everything with care and professionalism.
s f.}Los Angeles, CA}16}34}4}-1}4}2/16/2009}I am a devotee of Curry House restaurants in CA, and Curry-Ya is a lovely if slightly more upscale addition to my list of fave Japanese curry joints.The food is obviously prepared with a lot of thought and impeccably presented. The curry set was a nice deal although I am not crazy about the cold appetizer. The curry itself was solid - I got the croquette kind, and it was very good. I've tried both desserts (the yogurt mousse w/ blueberry sauce and the white wine jelly) and found each to be a light, refreshing end to a satisfying curry meal.I think it's cash only, so come prepared and leave that plastic at home!
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}3}2/5/2009}I liked that they made use of the tiny space they have. Curry was alright, but the care they took in presenting it was great. The place is very clean and I liked the jazz music playing in the background. The staff is extremely polite. It is not so overly priced if you come for lunch $8 for their specials which include a side salad, which was very colorful. I liked how their green teas are made with matcha powder. They do not have a vegetarian option, I think it is because their curry base is made from beef/chicken broth. They do have a vegetable curry though. Also I would like to see them serve brown rice, but I guess that would take away the traditional aspect of things. I also tried their yogurt dessert it was cute and fresh to end a heavier curry meal with but nothing special.
Ella C.}New York, NY}9}60}6}-1}3}1/24/2009}I went to this place twice in the past week and my feelings are somewhat mixed! The first time, I had the berkshire pork cutlet  curry and loved it! The pork was fried nicely, crisp and moist! I was impressed with the presentation also. I was expecting a plate of rice/pork/curry to come out with chopsticks and a fork, but i got a small pot of curry (so cute) which was separate from my pork/rice on a white plate. They even gave you a small ladle for the curry along with a small dish for picked onions and ginger. I thought the service was nice and friendly too. I agree maybe the flavour of the curry isn't deep enough..but it was a cold winter's day and the whole meal was so satisfying! The second time around, I ordered the seafood curry. To be honest i was not impressed..it was basically the same curry as the first time but with bits of seafood and string beans thrown into the curry...Im not sure exactly what I was expecting to be honest but i wasn't blown away by the this combo...probably best to stick to the pork curry i think. I loved their toilet! It was small but cute with the bidae (electronic) toilet. i love those things! esp the warm seats! Overall, i do like this place and i think i will definitely go back again. However at $15 for  the pork curry i think it's a little overprices for the food you are getting. I would give it 3-3.5 stars.
Paul D.}Wellington, New Zealand}79}316}15}-1}3}1/19/2009}Tasty, hit-the-spot, beautiful presentation - honestly, a great, if little pricey, spot for Japanese comfort food.Oh but the electronically controlled toilet - haha that was the highlight!!
Lainy C.}Los Angeles, CA}128}605}5}18}4}1/18/2009}I rounded to 4 stars because the service is so friendly and everything is so cute and refined here. The curry here is good, but a little lacking in depth. I think the Hot was actually mild but that's pretty typical. The pork cutlet was pretty good but not as juicy as Katsu Hama or Kamui Den. Even though it was a little pricier than some other curry places, I found the curry portions quite generous and didn't finish all of the curry rice. A solid place to add to your curry list but not a place I would travel far for.
Alan N.}Morristown, NJ}81}334}8}-1}4}1/11/2009}Ended up here because the wait at Ippudo was an hour. seriously people? anyway, glad I went to Curry-ya as it was recently written about in the New Yorker. side note, Curry-ya is related to Rai Rai Ken, which already received my stamp of approval. the menu is very simple. there's only about 6 curry dishes. We opted for the Prime Beef Curry and the Berkshire Pork Katsu Curry and split the special (which is dried curry and a salad for $8). The prime beef curry starts with cooking steak and mushrooms in butter, then throwing it into a curry pot on a hot stove. The Pork curry has a deep fried pork cutlet served with curry pot on the side. each comes with a heap of rice. The special was really good for $8 (half the price of the others) but was really ilke chili over rice. All in all it was really good. not sure it's worth the $15, but it was definitely tasty and hit the spot. I will go back again i'm sure. Oh also, it's really not that spicy, even the hot wasn't that spicy. And it's cash only. Lunch for two came out to $42 after tax and tip. Add one more star for the SICk toilet in the bathroom. It has a console that lifts the seat. AMAZING.
Dennis Y.}Sunnyside, Queens, NY}122}190}38}-1}2}12/31/2008}I have been wanting to go to Curry Ya since it's opening for a while. I went but was it a big disappointment...It's all about the presentation and service, okay, I get it. But the food sucked.It seemed like that there was a commotion around the big rice cooker -- they didn't have enough rice! Eventually, someone went out and actually brought a mound of rice (on a plate) from the outside, which was freezing cold at the time. I wondered where that rice might have come from? The basement? Rai Rai Ken next door? Now I had to NOT think about that my rice that they were going to serve me was exposed to the snow and cold street air... as I was so hungry that I had to eat.Not for a place where you go and eat rice!? I was appalled. The katsu came. It was a piece of crap. I thought it was from a bento box sitting in the fridge for days -- microwaved. It looked so stale and dull. The penko was shy and sad. There is nothing comparable to the katsu I had at Katsu Hama just a few weeks ago which was lush, fluffy and glistening. Of no surprise, this katsu tasted dry, tough and not delicious.The pot of curry tasted bland. I am a huge fan of Japanese curry, and at that point I almost felt that my Japanese cubed curry tasted much better than that pot of bubbling curry. It's thick, but it's just boring. Nothing special. What's the point of making everything so intricate and pretty? Each plate is decorated by a branch of raisins -- on stems. Whatever. I am all for the details, I could appreciate their attention to details but at the end of the day, the food has to be good.I would want to give 1 star for the the experience. But they deserve an extra star for the service and their attention to details.
Hideki K.}New York, NY}466}1079}310}-1}5}12/23/2008}Best Japanese Curry in NYC! Not sure why Curry-Ya (House of Curry) isn't receiving more love from the Yelpletariat.  I checked this place out upon John L.'s recommendation.  That guy is a St Marks / East Village Japanese food expert! Sure, it's pricey, with slow service, and the seating arrangement isn't conducive for group interaction (stools arranged around a counter), but the curry is damn good. They owners / workers of Curry-Ya make excellent use of their limited space, in true Japanese fashion (where the entire nation is limited on space).  The kitchen is right in front of you, Momofuku ko-style, as Deborah H. states. The curry here is quite flavorful and harkens me back to my adolescence in Japan.  The veggie special curry is good, but the veggies vary on a daily basis.  The berkshire pork cutlet (katsu) is better at Katsu Hama, but the cut I had was fatty, crispy, and substantial enough to satisfy me. For $3 extra, you can get oomori (extra sauce, in this case, same amount of rice) of the curry.  The $6 combo deal is only worth it if you choose a dessert (lassi, anyone?) instead of a drink.  I'm such a sucker for the ramune, and no... I didn't take the glass marble home with me. Remember, they don't take reservations, and it's cash-only.  If possible, try to avoid the seats (more like square stools) near the door to avoid the draft.  Oh yes, Japanese "extra spicy" is a joke.  It would be considered mild in India...  Definitely not Yoga Fire!  Their "mild" is watered down with milk, something to keep in mind if you're a lactose intolerant. Curry-Ya is here to stay, and is now a permanent fixture in my regular rotation!
Deborah H.}Boston, MA}246}720}0}-1}4}12/22/2008}In general, I'm not a fan of Japanese curry.  It lacks the heat and personality of Indian curries and lacks the flavor of Thai curries.  It seems like it's a comfort food that Japanese families would make at home only when they're out of other ideas.  I'll eat it when it's convenient, but I would never order it at a restaurant, or go out of my way to get it, despite my boyfriend's constant pestering.Lucky for him, we were in a group where I was outnumbered three to one.  We showed up at Curry-Ya, and waited for a bit for seats to open up.  The restaurant has counter-seating only, and accommodates around 10 patrons at a time.  Perched on a backless chair and watching the chefs at work, it reminded me a smidgen of Momfuku Ko.As many other reviewers noted, this place is expensive for comfort food.  Most meat curries go around $13, with the range between $11 and $17.  You can add an appetizer and drink/dessert for an extra $6.  The curry comes in a personal pot along with a plate of rice, and small dishes of raisins, fried onion chips, shallots, and pickled radish.  It was admittedly delicious.  The curry had multiple dimensions of flavor that were enunciated by the various add-ins.  Though the portions were generous, I ate my curry all up.  The Berkshire pork cutlet, however, was dry and disappointing.Service is pretty good, but there were some lax moments: neglecting water, forgetting orders.  Also the flavors aren't spicy at all: my "hot" would have been a "please, EXTRA MILD" at a Thai restaurant.  I'd return for my next curry fix, but maybe not biweekly like I promised someone.
Hana Y.}Long Island City, NY}90}79}0}-1}3}12/10/2008}I would LOVE to give this place more stars, but I can't, for the same reason as Ippudo.  Way too expensive for street food.  Well, not street food as much as... food entirely common-place in Japanese households.  I like how the curry tastes a lot, and it is a nostalgic taste for anybody who spent their childhood in Japan.  However, if you want anything in the curry at all, it's $11 up.  And I mean, I loved the hamburg curry plus cheese topping, but it's not really enough to get me full either.And when my brother was visiting, I thought I'd take him out here, since he only moved here from Japan a few months ago and must be home-sick.  But then I thought, I'll just make it myself.  For much cheaper.  AND with a bunch of vegetables and meat.So that's all I have to say about that.
Amy M.}Santa Clara, CA}194}110}79}-1}4}12/8/2008}Best Japanese-style curry I've had thus far. I can agree with all of the positive reviews below. :) The pork cutlet is cooked perfectly, and the curry is really tasty. My favorite part is that you can order a raw quail egg on the side (along with other sides as well). I usually take the raw quail egg yolk and place it on top of the rice/curry. YUM!It might just be a small counter-joint, but it manages to find ways to make your dining experience pleasant nonetheless (unless you are in a group.. probably not good for more than 2 people). There are hooks for coats along the inside of the counter, and you can put your bag on a shelf on the inside of the seat. This is a must in the winter months, because I hate when I go to a restaurant and they seat you somewhere where there is no back rest or space to put your stuff.Mmm... berkshire pork cutlet curry with quail egg yolk.......
Cindy T.}New York, NY}69}118}5}-1}5}11/13/2008}Curry-Ya is a great place to eat. It's really easy for me to give it 5 stars! I haven't ooh-ed and yum-yum-ed over food like I did at Curry-Ya in a long time.All of the seating at Curry-Ya is at a bar (no tables). The staff are very friendly and will answer any questions you have. As a vegetarian, I was curious if its curry is vegetarian. The answer the staff gave me is no. The curry base of each dish contains meat. Because I'm a vegetarian for health reasons instead of pro-animal reasons, I don't mind eating something that might have a little meat in the base -- but I know it bothers some vegetarians. So, VEGETARIANS BE WARNED! All curries contain meat (pureed, so it's not visible to the eye). Even the vegetable curry is not vegetarian.The curry is a perfect balance of flavor. The staff gave me three small bowls of different kinds of pickled onions and raisins to add to the dish I ordered. Yum-yum! It was so delicious! I can't wait to return to Curry-Ya.Recommended: Seafood curryCash only.
Daniel C.}New York, NY}25}90}0}-1}4}10/8/2008}Even though curry is an remarkably simple dish, the curry here is both unmistakably refined and simple. I'd even say cute, but hey how many foods do you eat that are cute?
Andy D.}Los Angeles, CA}142}97}33}-1}4}10/6/2008}Oh yeah -- the pork katsu curry was totally delicious -- a plate of tonkatsu, perfectly breaded and fried, and then a bowl of pureed curry to spoon into a large donut of rice.  Loved it!  Perfect wintery comfort food.  Pickled garlic, raisins, and something pink to chuck in as you see fit.I was less impressed -- not at all impressed -- with the seaweed salad that the waitress pushed on me.  I was completely jealous, though, of someone else's three-item appetizer sampler, featuring just a spoon of kaiso salad, flanked by a spoon of potato salad, and the same of sweet potato.  looked great.
ThanOng S.}New York, NY}78}42}1}-1}5}9/21/2008}I loveeee the place. The first time i was there I didnt expect anything much. I thought it's an ordinary japanese curry in the US. but i was wrong. The taste was good, quality product and nice staffs. I go back there all the time!!
Maria C.}New York, NY}19}146}1}-1}3}9/20/2008}Ok, so Japanese curry is something you can make at home, easily.  But some curry places have a special feeling or taste that you can't duplicate home made house curry.  Curry-ya doesn't have that special something.  I don't really cook much anymore, so I often order take out from here.  And Curry-ya is good.  It is what it is - japanese curry.  I like the croquette curry best.  The pickled accompaniments are a must.  If you order to go, be sure to ask for the rakkyo onions on the side because they only give you the red pickles.  Overall a very filling and hearty meal.   I didn't like the vegetable curry - thought it was too spicy and was not a huge fan of the types of veggies they used.
Pam S.}Brooklyn, NY}186}412}399}-1}4}9/13/2008}Everyone's heard of those Japanese bathroom seats that squirt water, blow some hot air and emit a puff of air freshener at the press of a button, but this place has actually got one! If you've never tried one of these bad boys before, now's your little excuse -- dinner at Curry-Ya! Although Japanese curry has never really topped my I LOVE CURRY list.. and boy, do I love curry (Indian and Thai), I must say this place did a pretty decent job! I actually would come back for more (altho the $20 pricetag on a plate of rice and a single person serving of curry with tax&tip does dissuade). Taste - spicier than the usual Japanese curry houses, which is good for me. The curry didn't have chunks of carrot or potato in it, it's cooked smooth, almost like a puree' and whatever meat you choose is thrown in afterwards. I had the organic grilled chicken, which I could watch them cook from my vantage point on the bar stool seat. The curry is cooked and then served in a plain metal tin pot for one, and each serving starts from $10 upwards, depending on what protein you select.Cute spot, pretty good food, nice clean decor, and the usual bar stool narrow space type of fooderie that is typical of this neighborhood. I guess you could call it charming.
Alaine H.}Singapore, Singapore}661}286}358}-1}4}9/11/2008}I am so glad we stumbled upon this place b/c both my boyfriend and I love Japanese Curry. We order it at Japanese restaurants or make it at home quite often. The first time we went to Curry-Ya was during their lunch time and their set is an amazing deal. Seaweed salad, coleslaw, a drink or dessert of choice, and a curry. I ordered the pork katsu curry, and got a oolong tea for the drink. The pork was tender, the curry was thick and the amount of rice is perfect. The minus star is for the lack of potatoes and carrots that is stereotypical of most Japanese curries. This restaurant will definitely be frequent pit stop in the weekends.
Andrew C.}New York, NY}60}27}0}-1}4}9/10/2008}The $15 lunch special is a real treat. It's been on my list to go since I read the review in the nytimes. Lunch started with an assortment of 3 small salads: vegetable, seaweed, and japanese coleslaw (At least, i think that's what our waitress said). The squash in the vegetable salad had great texture and a nice mild flavor.Next, was the entree. I chose a traditional pork katsu. It was breaded/fried just right, a nice thin crust, not soggy, and not oily. And the pork was moist and tender. With the entree, you have the option of getting the accompanied curry in 3 levels of spicyness: mild, hot, and very hot. I got the very hot, and it really wasn't that spicy at all.  One thing I found nice about the meal, was that they give you free toppings for the curry! raisins, almond slices, pickled shallots (awesome), plus something I forgot at the moment. The meal finishes with your choice of drink. I chose an iced chai tea, which definitely settled my stomach. It probably could have been a tad less sweet though.In summary, good value! I think I will definitely go back.Also, compared to Go Go Curry on 38th, I think this curry is less "creamy" tasting.
Peter S.}New York, NY}457}59}4}-1}5}9/7/2008}I fell in love with Japanese curry while in Japan for two months this summer, so I just had to go to Curry-Ya the second I heard about it. I went really early last Thursday (6:30... its a school night!) and my aunt and I were just two of four (8 is the max) customers. We both got the seaweed salad (a little more lettuce than seaweed, but delicious anyways) and she got the regular (not hot or very hot) chicken curry. I got the tonkatsu (pork cutlet) with hot curry. The hot curry was what I was used to receiving in Japan as their normal curry, but the regular curry supposedly still had some heat. It was very nice to be able to watch the prep process happen right in front of us. I love that they serve you the rice with an onion ring on it, and then your curry in a cute pot... very modern, very clean. Also, the waitstaff were all Japanese, and really friendly. The waitress began talking to me because I ordered in Japanese, and she wanted to know how I spoke it. She asked me where my two home stays in Japan were and I told her Fukuoka and Okayama. She suddenly flipped out and screamed and clapped her hands because she was from Okayama! It was very cool.EDIT: Ordered in delivery from Curry-Ya last night. the delivery came quickly (15 min), especially for such a small place. They pack everything  up well so that nothing was soggy or cold or gross by the time it got to me.
Jason H.}Saint Louis, MO}5}25}0}-1}4}8/27/2008}A bit of a creative twist on ... well ... curry.  They'll put cheese in it for ya'!  Sure, you can probably make it at home.  But it has a tight-nit little atmosphere, and it's good for take-out.  Recommended if you're looking for something quick, tasty, and reasonably priced.
Greg T.}San Francisco, CA}100}132}36}-1}3}8/25/2008}This place must be making a killing.  10 cents worth of rice, 20 cents worth of curry and $1 for firm yet edible tonkatsu. However, they probably need that sort of margin on their food as the restaurant only seats 8 at a time.  Curry Ya falls into the same category as Ippudo and Momofuku Noodle bar--decent quality, decent taste but is the antithesis of the meaning of the food, which is inexpensive, easy eats.  I like a more homestyle curry, the kind that mothers make in japan with onions and carrots and potatoes, of which this had none.  The flavor was richer than the sauce cubicles so I assume they make theirs from scratch or add a little somethin' somethin'.15 bucks, however, is pushing it for curry and rice.
nicole R.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}2}8/25/2008}I am a longtime faithful of Rai Rai Ken, so when they stopped selling curry to open a curry shop next door, I was excited. Our first attempt to eat there was a bit frustrating but the food was not bad. A bit overpriced for what it was, with exceedingly slow and incompetent service. Second attempt: they told us there was a 30 minute wait (for a counter/bar eatery!) so we decided to order to go. 5 minutes after we ordered to go ( about 8 min after we asked about wait times) 6 people left the restaurant. We were annoyed at the incompetence but decided to just wait for our takeout. More time goes by. Now its been about 20 minutes since we ordered. The server comes outside to tell us that one of the items we ordered, TO GO, 20 MINUTES AGO, isn't available today. They only have about 10 items on the menu in the first place, and why did she wait 20 minutes to tell us? Geez. We went next door and ate ramen. Hopefully this suck fest will go out of business and rai rai ken will start carrying curry again.
Dorothy L.}San Francisco, CA}64}503}317}-1}4}8/17/2008}YUMMY!  i dont like curry but the flavors were great.  i really liked the berkshire pork cutlet the server recommended.  for an additional $6, you can try their trio of salads and a dessert.  for my dessert, i got lychee flavored lassi (yogurt).
Scott R.}Austin, TX}296}784}12}-1}4}8/6/2008}While this sounds like a collaboration of Andre 3000 of OutKast and Dan "the Automator" Nakamura from the Gorillaz, this baby sibling of East Village Japanese specialist spots Rai Rai Ken and Otofuku is my favorite of the three.I hadn't been wowed by Japanese curry prior to Curry-ya but I found their hot sauce (also available in mild and extra hot)  to be a really nice mix of flavor and spice - somewhere b/w Indian curry and perhaps Indonesian or MalaysianVarious meats/vegetables are available to be smothered by the curry including filet mignon, grilled chicken, and berkshire pork cutlet.  My Yelper-in-Crime and I tried the Berkshire Pork Cutlet & the Croquette (Deep-Fried Mashed Potatoes).  The breading on both was nice and light.  I actually preferred the croquette as it was lighter and I found the entree to be just an excuse to enjoy the curry/breading.  The Berkshire Pork cutlet was good but I find frying takes the wow out Berkshire Pork. (I've compared it in the past to a pretty girl wearing a lot of makeup.  It doesn't need frying - it's perfect as is.  In other words, don't put lipstick on a pig. )The prices are high - most are in the $12-$15 range.  The $15 lunch special is the best value as you get one of the curries, a trio of small salads (a seaweed, a seafood, and forget the third - beautifully presented) , and either a beverage of dessert.  I went with grapefruit jelly (read: jello) that was quite nice.The place itself is pretty spartan.  One long lunch counter and two window seats - similar to Rai Rai Ken.  Worth checking out...
jayson C.}Brooklyn, NY}6}1}0}-1}4}8/4/2008}Just went here for a late lunch at 4pm on a friday. First thing you'll notice is the space is very small. It is very typical in japan to just have a small counter seating 5-10 people in this kind of establishment, ie..Rai Rai Ken (RAMEN) there sister restaurant next door. The curry was great, some of the best i've had in NYC. I had the Pork curry. i especially liked that they give you  four little accompanyment with it. if i remember correctly it was raisins, pickled baby leeks, pickled red pepper and dried onion flakes, "don't quote me on this, this is just what i think it is." The price was a little steep, $15 for curry, but after i had licked my plate i had no problem paying the $15. i will definately be dining here again.
Dorim L.}Chicago, IL}103}546}3}-1}4}8/3/2008}Just went here for dinner.  First, their restaurant is really cramped...really cramped.  I had to walk sideways through the space and had to suck in my stomach to pass through the rows of people sitting on stools.  You have like a foot of space when walking towards the rest room.  They had an electric toilet which was cool.  Back to the food; it was pretty tasty curry.  But I can't justify paying over $10 for something I can cook myself.  If it was more like $6 to $8, then I'd be okay with the price.  All in all a nice experience but next time I have a craving for curry, I'll just cook it myself instead of eating it in a cramped room full of people and smoke.
Justin C.}Boston, MA}655}359}11}-1}4}8/3/2008}Great little curry spot. It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall, with only counter service and about 5 seats total. The pork cutlet curry was absolutely scrumptious, not too spicy, but very savory and tasty. The pork was panko crusted and deep fried, juicy and succulent, and the staff was just lovely. Look forward to eating there again!
Gracie-C Y.}San Francisco, CA}76}308}2}-1}4}7/29/2008}Why the Japanese embraced curry is a mystery to me.Considering that Japanese food is well-known for subtle and clean flavors, their love of curry is truly a phenomenon.In Tokyo, you'll find hundreds of places that serve nothing but curry... they are some of my fondest memories during my travels.It goes without say then, that when I stumbled upon Curry-Ya, I nearly soiled my shorts from pure joy.  I was already glowing earlier in the week from my dreamy experience at Go Go Curry, and didn't expect to find another curry-only place so soon.Curry-ya's interior is small but neat.  Almost every seat is at the counter and you'll be able to watch the furious curry cookin' up close and personal.Wifey and I went for lunch which was a decent deal because they have a lunch special for $15 that includes a salad/starter, your choice of curry, and a choice of dessert vs. chai or other fruity drink.Our starter was a lovely trio of seaweed salad, Japanese slaw, and marinated summer vegetables and pumpkin.  Sure was purty...My pork katsu curry had a nicely breaded Berkshire pork cutlet which was moist and juicy.  The curry was rich and complex, but lacked enough heat to be superior.  In actuality, I prefer Go Go Curry's version... sorry.On the plus side, service was great and this place is a great upscale change from Go Go's low-brow college dorm setting.
Princess M.}New York, NY}34}337}591}-1}2}7/28/2008}Nice decor, interesting variations and pleasant service but ultimately, the curry is not that great.I tried the pork cutlet curry.  The pork cutlet was very nicely crisp and served freshly fried.  It was tender and fatty enough.  I like the fact that they have extras such as cheese and corn available for adding to your curry (served in little dishes on the side for you to add on your own).  I also like the tiny flakes of salty garlic chips that are also served up as a condiment.However, the curry sauce itself, although it has a nice kick, it doesn' t have much flavour.  I've definitely had better Japanese curries elsewhere.
Scarlett S.}New York, NY}18}126}0}-1}4}7/27/2008}Love this curry spot. One of my top japanese curry spots in the city. I enjoy being able to see the kitchen, so I know how exactly my food is being prepared. The pork cutlet is awesome, so crispy and moist. The curry is soo good not too spicy just right. I like the little toppings they give you as well. The salads are pretty good as well, very refreshing they have a marianted and grill salad made with squash, zucchini, peppers, and onions, very nice. Very attentive service and I don't mind the small space, its very homey.
John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}3}7/17/2008}Japanese curry is one of my favorite comfort foods so I was eager to eat at this new restaurant.  I never think of a curry joint as a restaurant of refinement, however, Curry-Ya is trying to doing just that.  The service and presentation are elegant.  I like how the curry is served in a separate dish from the rice and protein.  The restaurant is the size of a shoebox and is clean and sleek.  I found the curry thinner and lighter than my favorite Go-Go Curry.  Not packing the punch that Go-Go delivers.  I do like the option to select a more spicy curry.  The extra spicy isn't really all that spicy for my taste.  I had the Berkshire Pork Cutlet and it was a bit tough and overcooked.  $15 for a plate of curry is pretty darn pricey compared to its competition.  Go-Go Curry remains my favorite after two visits to Curry-Ya.
Loretta H.}San Francisco, CA}10}95}22}-1}3}7/11/2008}If you are into Japanese curry, this place is a must-visit.  Definitely a step-up than Go Go Curry in terms of flavor and presentation.  This place got really authentic and delicious Japanese curry.Contrary to the review below, I find the Seafood curry a bit too spicy.  The price tag is also a bit expensive.  Getting a large curry and a drink comes to about 20 bucks.  20 bucks isn't that much to pay for dinner but maybe it's just seating at the counter makes me feel like I should be paying less, or maybe it's just paying 20 bucks for Japanese curry...Presentation of the food is definitely a plus.  I would definitely go back again.
liezl n.}New York, NY}9}29}3}-1}3}7/7/2008}Update in July:  Just ordered chicken curry to go - very little chicken , and that totally blows.  I downgrade to 3 stars.  I give 4 stars for presentation/delivery; 3 stars for taste and portion size.  Did they raise the price to $13?!?  WTF....  Original review: This joint is nice and very authentic (I lived in Japan and am comparing to my experiences there).  They serve the food in such a pretty way with the hotpot of curry placed in front of you and your steaming mountain of rice.  Accompaniments of raisins, dried onion, picked ginger and shallots are requisite for the true experience.I ordered the mild seafood curry and found it just like the mild curry in Japan, not spicey at all.  The scallops were flavorfull and the shrimp was tasty, which is more than I can say for most seafood curries in the city where the taste of the actual seafood is drowned out by the curry.  The curry isn't heavy and tastes just right.  The chicken is organic and was broiled so it had a nice charred taste.  For $12 you're getting a pretty good comforting meal.The Japanese toilet is a must visit.  Make yourself go #1 even if you don't have to, and if you're so bold in this tiny space, go #2 and have a real cleanup treat!  The spray will leave you so fresh and so clean.
Ww H.}New York, NY}11}61}0}-1}2}7/1/2008}The above review hit it right on as she said the curry is more refined and not as heavy as Go Go Curry. However, that is about the only thing good about the food here. I had the Pork Cutlet (katsu) and was disappointed because it was overcooked and a tad dry.  For $15, you're better suited hitting up Teriyaki Boy and getting their Katsu curry for $7.75 (oddly one of my favorite dishes in the city). My friend ordered the beef curry and received only 3 small pieces of beef. Again, the food was good but at $15 you would expect at least some cabbage on the side and some more meat.
Laurea D.}Brooklyn, NY}104}25}0}-1}3}6/30/2008}If you are into Japanese curry then this is a place you should check out. There isn't anything else here except curry so don't come here expecting other options. The curry is more refined and not as heavy as Go Go Curry so this is something you can eat even in summer time. The curry at Curry-Ya is served hot and separately in a bowl, which gives you more control over the amount of curry in your entree - unlike Go Go Curry which piles it on your entree so you can't decide how much curry you want.I went on opening night and it was fairly quiet. This place is very very small so it is *not* good for groups. There are only 14 counter seats so best to come here with no more than 4 people if you go during peak time. I tried the fried shrimp with the regular curry. You can order regular curry, medium and spicy so you can pick an option based on how spicy you like the curry. The shrimp was slightly overcooked but still pretty good, I am going back to try the potato croquette and the seasonal vegetables. They do have the classic beef, pork and chicken options and they also have hamburger. Make sure to try the grapefruit jelly dessert, it is a nice contrast and really good way to end the meal.

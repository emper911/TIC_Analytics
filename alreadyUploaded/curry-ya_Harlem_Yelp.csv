Wailana W.}Brooklyn, NY}16}267}990}18}4}3/31/2018}So far this is the better of most local Japanese curry places.  I order take out and their container keeps everything separate until you're ready to eat.  The flavor is spot on.  If you have a hankering for good curry with good pieces of pork or chicken that are not too thin or over fried, this is the joint.  It's a little more expensive than the rest but you're paying for quality.  Luckily it's in my neighborhood which has many good fried chicken restaurants to choose from, but for a change of pace, the curry and Japanese steamed rice makes for a comforting alternative.  You can choose your level of heat and mild is just fine for me.
Jacky C.}Brooklyn, NY}809}10}0}-1}3}3/16/2018}Very mediocre. Came here with my girlfriend craving curry. Definitely over-priced for what you get and personally would not come here unless it was convenient. Service was okay. We were the only ones in the place. They forgot the salad that came with the meal and I had to remind them after the meal was done.
Mitchell R.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}5}1}-1}2}2/16/2018}I've been here 3 times to dine in. The food is good and consistent with the other two locations, but the service is quite unprofessional. It's very unfortunate because I think they do expect you to tip them if you dine in. As a suggestion, make sure to specify mild/medium/hot spiciness because they never ask and just default to mild.
George T.}New York, NY}485}218}1155}18}3}12/4/2017}Another sign of upper manhattan gentrification. I love it. Service is pretty fast. I had the classic chicken cutlet curry. Standard quality curry and katsu. Lunch special also came with a salad with tasty ginger dressing. Serving size is just right...I was full at the end of my meal. Not as good a places downtown but a nice addition to the neighborhood.
Carmen W.}New York, NY}111}206}173}18}1}9/13/2017}Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe it was an off night-regardless, I felt like wanting my money back. I got dry curry with a side of chicken katsu-every bite of the chicken I had was a bad. The curry was very bland. Rice and egg were good, but both very hard to mess up. I just feel like you get a much better deal at go go curry-which is like a fast food version of this that's 3-5$ cheaper (depending on what you get) and tastes SO much better. If I were you, I'd "curry-ya" wallet outta here. It's a curry-nah for me.
Mabel L.}Manhattan, NY}383}60}0}-1}4}7/16/2017}Great curry! Prefer the chicken katsu over the pork, and the baked curry was interesting but too heavy. Would recommend the normal curry instead
Daniel H.}New York, NY}175}21}20}-1}5}6/28/2017}I've regularly ordered delivery from this place and have yet to be disappointed. The chicken/pork katsu that comes with the curry is fantastic. The curry is quite plain and a little salty but tastes good. When I get tired of the kasu, the Japanese classic is a great substitution; the only problem I have with this is that sometimes I don't get many pieces of meat in the curry.
Michelle K.}New York, NY}7}5}13}-1}5}6/15/2017}I love the Curry-ya on the Lower East Side. I tried the uptown location for the first time and found the service friendly and food just as delectable! This is my favorite Japanese curry in the city. I think ordering extra rice is worth it. I've tried the vegetable croquette at the other location and enjoyed it. I like the classic and katsu. The lassi at LES locale was tasty and cut the spice nicely. I go with medium.
Helga G.}Manhattan, NY}0}11}0}-1}5}6/15/2017}What a lovely little and highly refined place serving very authentic Japanese curry and other old classics as toppings - Katsu etc. the meal which comes with a beautifully presented salad is in true Japanese style served elegantly in silver sauce dishes - everything is fresh and tastes just like Japan and nothing is expensive. Other NYC restaurants should visit this small place to see how you can serve good food beautifully and not charge an arm and a leg.There are  more than 4 seats as some reviewer wrote.
Yana K.}New York, NY}38}16}28}-1}5}6/7/2017}Great comfort food! It is actually not as busy as some reviews have indicated, so I am glad I did not get discouraged to walk there.
Alexander C.}Los Angeles, CA}129}6}1}-1}5}6/2/2017}Try the baked curry. Worth it. I still prefer the east village branch. The service can be a little better, but it's still good. Btw they need some music inside.
Jenny L.}New York, NY}43}8}0}-1}5}5/28/2017}I love this place soooooo much. It's worth the wait in the tiny, tiny, authentic sized Japanese establishment. My favorite is the chicken katsu curry, but I've tried others and it's never a let down. I recommend eating here rather than doing take out though cause it's a completely different experience. The food, of course, is always better fresh and steamy.
New Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}71}11}-1}5}2/19/2017}Lovely little spot that serves a traditional Japanese curry. I had a classic one and thought that taste was great. It reminded me of Japan's Coco ichi curry chain. They definitely don't use S&B's instant curry and make their own curry from scratch. Meat was cooked to perfection and kabotchya as one of veggies was a great choice (it's slightly sweet and is a perfect match for spicy curry). The size was perfectly and it came with a small salad.
Clara M.}Albany, CA}1}42}0}-1}4}1/27/2017}I came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal. We all got a different curry in the baked style with egg and cheese (costs extra) and all enjoyed our food. The curry came with pickled radishes and onions. Each dish was $19-21. We had a minor confusion at the end with the staff because we had a coupon that they were reluctant to honor (coupon wording was a bit vague) but it was eventually figured out. The baked curry is a very large portion and I took home leftovers. As a college student I probably wouldn't come back because of the price, but I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would recommend.
Melissa M.}New York, NY}118}206}97}-1}2}1/3/2017}Ordered the chicken katsu curry with rice and veggies. Mehh... not for $14.50....This restaurant is owned by the neighbors next door who also run the ramen joint. I took my Japanese friend here and we really weren't that impressed, and yes I know what to expect given that its in Harlem across from a housing complex and its nowhere near Broadway where its busiest, but I can make this food at home easily.
Robert M.}Bronx, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}12/9/2016}The chicken katsu curry is amazing. You can choose mild medium or hot. I think the mild has the best flavor. I'm pretty sure they're all the same base, they just add something to make it spicy. Next time I'll try the Japanese classic which comes with beef and vegetables.
Susan X.}Claremont, CA}5}367}152}-1}4}11/8/2016}Salad-very good. Fresh greens. Well seasoned tomato and red pepper slices that open up your appetite. Baked Japanese classic-delicious. Flavourful homemade Japanese curry with a layer of cheese. Fresh raw egg. The egg yolk adds a little more sweetness and mixes very well with all the ingredients. Well cooked rice. Tender beef cubes, potatoes and carrots. Sweet kabocha that reminds you of home. Unfortunately there is only one piece. Mini Berkshire katsu-average. Good quality of pork. A little dry.
Tracey U.}Bronx, NY}1}10}44}-1}5}11/7/2016}I ordered the classic Japanese curry (beef, carrots, potatoes; also had squash, green string beans, and zucchini) Before the main dish, I was served a small portion of salad, you can taste the fresh ingredients very well. My visit was during lunch 12noon.The beef in the curry was cooked in perfection where it almost feels like it melts in your mouth. Of course it was served with steamed white rice. My food was hot to warm until my last bite which left me highly satisfied!
David C.}New York, NY}189}1}0}-1}5}11/5/2016}awesome curry place with no wait and amazing food. the selection was very good with a wide choice of various meats for the curry and cooking methods. the salad was also light and delicious. check it out.
Edjanine S.}Manhattan, NY}2}99}36}-1}4}10/15/2016}Im giving 4 stars because the portion doesnt justify the price, its way too expensive, it was $12 something/ plateAnyway,We ordered delivery today and we had the chicken katsu, it came really quick and the food was hot thats a big plus. The chicken was good and the curry is amazing.. and CURRY DOESNT HAVE PORK!!!!! My husband loved the pickles it was kinda weird because it was red. I wishwe took pic 1st before we ate it.. Over all the food was good.. will definitely order again, i just hope its around $10
Timothy H.}New York, NY}3}78}102}18}3}10/4/2016}Average curry but would be a solid introduction to kare raisu for any beginner. I absolutely love kare raisu so I was curious about what this place could do with the dish because it is usually a very straightforward one. I ordered the Berkshire Pork curry and it was perfectly cooked but the meat lacked much taste. The curry was served in an elegant lamp-looking pot which the cooks poured over the mound of steaming hot rice. This was a nice touch and they did not douse the rice in curry which can really ruin the dish. The curry had a hint of spicyness and was also tasty but in the end, it wasn't drastically better than the curry you can find at your local Asian grocery store. The pork was a nice touch but I don't think I will come back here unless a friend of mine really wants to try out kare raisu for the first time.
Tim W.}New York, NY}468}17}0}-1}2}7/26/2016}I'm usually not picky with food besides with curry...The restaurant was empty, yet service was quite slow. Vegetables came cold and undercooked  and the curry itself was very average. Their signature cheese dish would have taken 20 minutes and I was too hungry to wait. You're better off just getting curry at any old regular Japanese restaurant that's more accessible.
Ting Andrew L.}New York, NY}9}1}0}-1}1}7/11/2016}Really bad delivery. I call them and wait for 40mins. They told me they didn't have the order! Poor place!
Jessica S.}Flushing, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}6/23/2016}Horrible delivery service, took more than an hr and 30 minutes for my food to arrive. Of course, it arrived cold, can't even eat it. What a waste of money.
Lauren H.}New York, NY}318}153}838}-1}5}6/22/2016}Worth it, worth it! Thank you curry gods for opening up in the UWS, I may possibly be your No.1 customer. You think I'm kidding? Watch.Located just above Columbia U., this Curry Casa is bound to become a big hit within the student community. Get here while it's still new and ultimately a secret hideout... until it gets insanely popular like said LES location ;)Curry is insanely flavorful, just has the perfect amount of kick, and is more on the thinner side which is great since their portions are rather large.I'd definitely recommend the PORK KATSU dinner. You get a thick cut of pork chop, deep fried with Panko breadcrumbs, a side of rice, and of course a generous amount of Japanese curry.ACT QUICK -- if you are a first time Seamless user, you can get $10 OFF your first purchase of $15+ !! [as of 6/22/16]
Stephen L.}New York, NY}72}2}2}-1}5}6/17/2016}Super delicious curry! A coworker recommended this place to me, but the lower east location. I learned that there is a newer location by me and decided to give it a try. This business definitely beats the others I've had in flavor. This is your higher quality japanese curry spot which explains its higher price than others like Go Go Curry. This particular location is very clean, has nice seating and friendly staff. I wish you didnt have to pay extra to get the carrots and potatoes in the curry though but this was still really great and worth trying
Brynne C.}Manhattan, NY}4}4}0}-1}5}6/16/2016}The decor and ambiance were super cute here, but more importantly the food was so good! I had never had Japanese curry before but I am so glad I tried it. Everything tasted very fresh and I can see why everyone describes it as comfort food. Highly recommended!
J. Marty D.}Manhattan, NY}6}7}2}-1}4}6/1/2016}Another local gem opens in Harlem! Curry-ya is an adorable space with a big, beautiful kitchen. While it seems smallish at first, it's a perfect size for the local foot traffic. Prices are affordable and portions generous. The quality of the food is top notch, too. The only downside is that there's no restroom if you want to linger for a longer lunch; still, that's not a deal-breaker. Keep up the good work!
Elizabeth T.}San Francisco, CA}11}94}0}-1}5}5/6/2016}I'm a huge fan of Curry Ya in the east village so I am ABSOLUTELY THRILLED it's now also by my home. They have the best Japanese curry, hands down, in all of Manhattan. It's the best. I've gotten take out there and gone in person and recommend both. I've gotten the pork katsu, traditional curry, veggie curry, the seaweed salad, and the house salad - I recommend them all. Same with the croquettes. And the spice levels are fantastic and real if you like spicy food, like me.
L S.}Manhattan, NY}35}24}6}-1}5}4/17/2016}Super excited about this addition.  I got a baked vegetable curry,  the cheese was gooey the whole way through,  the sauce was perfectly spiced,  the vegetables perfectly tender.  The chef was friendly and the decor cheerful and comfortable.  Definitely going back.
Claudia D.}New York, NY}56}108}211}-1}4}4/9/2016}Curry-ya soft opening alert! Come now to get some Katsu n curry with goodies like free toppings (the cheaper ones of course, but still!) and free Mochi dessert if you insta-capture your meal. Now, for the deets: Curry is really great and deeply flavorful, and they claim it is a chicken and oxtail based concoction. I ordered the Japanese classic, which comes with ingredients like Kabocha pumpkin, bell pepper, and carrot. The chunks of beef were melty and amazing but there were, sadly, only a total of 3 (small) pieces. I should have expected as much, but I was hoping there would be more with the steeper price tag (as compared to cheaper joints like go go curry). If you are a stickler about portion size, I'm not sure if this is necessarily your place. However, I would stand by 4 stars with regards to the great flavor of the meal, and the great service. The interior is literally 4 seats, as I think they are primarily a take out service, but the tables they do have are cute and rustic. Love that they were blasting things like phantom of the opera and lion king too lol. Finally, don't forget to take advantage of their Instagram deal right now, because their Mochi is absolutely killer! Sesame and caramel were both delicious and a great way to cool down after the intense spices of the curry.

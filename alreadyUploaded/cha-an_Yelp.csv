Sary T.}New York, NY}0}8}13}-1}5}5/7/2018}This is one of my favorite place in NY.Matcha chiffon cake tastes very good !!!
Yung Chun C.}Flushing, NY}86}48}176}18}4}5/6/2018}Came to Cha An for their Strawberry short cake lesson and after class decided to just stop by downstairs for a simple drink and dessert. This beautiful and peaceful shop has so much tea to offer and seasonal desserts that is just perfect for each season!!!! Lolz that's why they are seasonal desserts~~~The last time I was here was last year around August. Their seasonal dessert was shaved ice. Matcha syrup or watermelon syrup. And last time I had their iced Hojicha which is roasted tea leaves tea. It has a more nutty flavor and cool for the hot weather. But this time I came down and had their mochi with hojicha ice cream ( I think the ice cream varies- don't really know). And had their new drinks!!!!! The jelly blossom was super duper bombinggggg!!!!!! It had jelly and ice with 3 balls of frozen juice!!! What they are I have no idea but the purple one is definitely grape!! The next one is the Jasmine Breeze which was smooth and crisp. It was refreshing and a little stronger but it is not very memorable. I wouldn't order it again but I would re order the jelly blossom over and over again!!!!!
Dannie W.}Boston, MA}37}282}621}-1}4}5/5/2018Updatedreview}We came back here again for their matcha. But this time is not as good as last time. It's not as creamy and it is more bitter. I wonder what changed. It's finally the season for Sakura drop. I wanted to taste it for long. But I'm kind of disappointed. The drop pretty much has no taste. That's why it comes with syrup to dip in. It's really just looks good but tastes nothing. The black sesame creme brûlée is still very good.
Nyx P.}Roselle, NJ}3}83}71}-1}5}5/4/2018}Been here a couple of times and it's one of my go to places for Japanese desserts. My favourite is their iced green tea latte which is very good and not too sweet. You can taste the matcha in it. Their desserts are phenomenal, tried a few regulars and specials like their ice cream, sakura blossom pudding, parfait, mochi mochi, creme brulee, ice cream sandwich, etc... There could be a long wait sometimes since the place is small and very popular. They'll get your phone number and call or text you once your table is ready. Wait can be quick or to an hour. It is a little pricey but over all experience is quality and attention to detail.
Aoshi L.}Jersey City, NJ}4}126}0}-1}3}5/1/2018}I have no idea why this place is so popular. The size of the food is pretty small. The desserts are not that delicate or tasty either. The only shining point for the whole meal is a salted fish which is prepared well enough. But didn't notice anything exceptionally good other than that.Again, I've definitely had better desserts somewhere else.
A K.}New York, NY}6}87}60}-1}3}4/29/2018}Everything looks great from the outside and inside decor. The bamboo and hut type feel really makes you feel as if you're not in New York City anymore. The tea pots and cups are nice too. However I came here around 11pm and felt rushed the ENTIRE time. If we were going to be rushed I would've appreciated they just tell our group that we are not seating after 11pm. After we realized there was a $7 minimum per person we decided to order 2 types of teas but order one first and then the second after so it wouldn't get cold. After getting the first tea they told us about the minimum requirement, we said yes we know but we want to order after we finish the first. We hadn't finished our second cup when another waitress comes and says we must order now or the will close the kitchen, when we told us we aren't ordering food but tea, she said ok then you have time. Within another few minutes a different waitress comes to tell us we must order the other tea now. This could've been resolved if the service communicated with one another. Finally after ordering the second we were given the check and then a fourth time told to pay. When we were told another crazy rule that it was $10 minimum per credit card and max 4 credit cards allowed. The tea was great but my friends and I couldn't enjoy it with all the constant pushing around. Service needs to improve. Nice ambiance but wouldn't come late night here.
Arlene Y.}New York, NY}506}255}135}18}5}4/27/2018Updatedreview}after many years, Cha-an is still one of my favorite dessert places. it never gets old.  from the sesame creme brulee, chocolate mochis, and their endless options of teas- there is a treat for everyone!
Dana L.}Irvine, CA}365}73}61}18}5}4/26/2018}I recently visited Cha-An on a trip I took to New York and I was thoroughly impressed. We went around 10PM on a weekend and it wasn't super packed and we were able to be seated immediately. I don't know if this would differ if we had gone a little earlier in the evening. We tried the matcha chiffon cake for $11 and the black sesame creme brulee for $9.50. We also got the hojicha tea for $7 and the summer wind cocktail for $15. I'm not much of a tea person, so I can't speak as much for that, but the others in my group enjoyed it and said it was good. My cocktail was good and flavorful. Now, onto the desserts. The matcha chiffon cake was very good but it was pretty large and we didn't end up finishing it. The real gem at this place was the black sesame creme brulee. I cannot rave enough about this! It was SO GOOD! It is topped with a scoop of black sesame ice cream and a cookie also made with black sesame. The creme brulee was so light and creamy and the sugar on top wasn't overdone like it is at many places. Overall, I would say this dessert is a must try if you check this place out! Lastly, the desserts here are so beautiful! Because I went late at night I wasn't able to get any good pictures because of the crappy lighting, but they were just so aesthetic!
Sandra Lorena V.}East Elmhurst, NY}117}139}156}18}4}4/26/2018}This place is cute- I am honestly still wondering how the cherry blossoms grow behind the walls, how they are maintained, are they always there etc. But back to the dessert..I believe the cocktail options are daring and perfected. The matcha garden with matcha green tea latte and hazelnut liqueur was tasty. The anmitsu (with green tea ice cream, red bean paste, jelly and mocha) was an enticing spoonful after the next. The textures and flavor of each component kept me curious and satisfied. I did not expect to like such a mix. In the future I want to try the black sesame crème brûlée as my friend really enjoyed hers. The staff was nice too. Thanked us for coming and let us wait for one of our friends while getting drinks.
Yoojin S.}Los Angeles, CA}248}337}433}18}3}4/25/2018}Was so excited to try this place, but left with mixed feelings. Mochi Mochi was really good and totally worth it! 5/5 Both types of the homemade mochi was fresh and stellar -- the white mochi was chewy, and the warabimochi was super soft with a good matcha flavor. Hojicha ice cream was really creamy and true to flavor. However, Hanami (spring special) was a let down. 1/5Sakura flavored desserts called out my name so I was excited to try this one, but none of the ingredients in the parfait stood out. The ice cream was good and creamy, yet I can't even recall what flavor it was. Though sakura is a subtle flavor, I couldn't even notice a hint of it. There seemed to be more strawberry than anything flavor wise. Overall pricey (hanami was $14, mochimochi $9). Ambiance was really cozy, but too dark at night. This place was also really popular! Packed and had a bit of wait on a thursday evening.
Alex Y.}Fort Lee, NJ}598}459}2254}18}4}4/24/2018}Nice improvement since I last visited, which was honestly quite some time ago.  Notable changes: they now accept credit cards, plus they also service some light mixed cocktails on the menu as well.Visited pretty much right when they were still preparing for dinner service, so unfortunately they only had dessert and drinks available to serve at that time.  Despite this, the place was still pretty much completely full.As the namesake indicates, I would suggest that people stay focused the tea offerings here for drinks, even though they do have cocktails available.  They really do have quite a variety of tea offerings.  Not necessarily the very best cut, but definitely pretty decent compared to other places.Desserts were nicely presented, and the chiffon cake was especially light and not overly sweet.  I'm not a big fan of dessert in general though.Overall, a nice and relaxing environment to just chill and get a conversation going.  Great date spot if you want to cut to the chase and just get to the sweet stuff.
Zhijian J.}Manhattan, New York, NY}22}42}147}-1}4}4/22/2018}I love the cake!The cream is full of air and so soft. The cake is also soft!And the jelly is also good!
Eleanor K.}Croton-on-Hudson, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}4/22/2018}What happened to this place?! Used to be wonderful.Was there w friends on a Saturday afternoon, we ordered the pricey desserts based on gorgeous photos on the menu but the actual items were arranged as if they were Play-Do creations by a five year old kid, nothing resembling the menu. The already subtle tasting desserts were just blah when thrown together in that manner, a huge disappointment. Thin matcha latte equally less than thrilling, looked terrible.The young waitstaff should also be trained better to not chitchat and giggle amongst themselves blocking the narrow aisles-- the ambience of this quiet quaint tea house is now careless.
Susan L.}Cambridge, MA}2}87}4}-1}5}4/21/2018}Cute small tea house with a nice selection of desserts. We enjoyed the Mochi Mochi, the Green Tea Parfait and I forgot the name of the seasonal parfait.
Siphie E.}New York, NY}26}36}7}-1}4}4/21/2018}Came here on a Friday night after work and loaded up on some crazy desserts. Ambience was fun and the service was great. The desserts were each the size of a small meal- something I couldn't tell from the menu or Yelp. So be careful! If you don't want to explode, be sure to share something. We got the hot Matcha latte, Matcha Chiffon cake, and mochi mochi. The matcha latte was ok, but I would recommend getting a different kind of tea to go with dessert because the latte was so overpowering and I needed a palette cleanser.
Grace Y.}Staten Island, Staten Island, NY}116}4}11}-1}5}4/19/2018}A friend recommend me to try this Japanese tea room. The place is well decorated with a cherry blossoms and has a nice Japanese feel! It makes me feel like I was in Japan for a moment! It is a relaxing place to enjoy a cup of tea, have a dessert and chat with friends! I am a matcha fan,so I tried the deluxe matcha latte and the green tea chiffon cake. I love the green tea chiffon cake!! The green tea chiffon cake was delicious. Tried so many different version of green tea chiffon cake, I think this place has the best green tea chiffon cake.The Green tea chiffon cake is a must try! Will come back to try all the other desserts and the different tea they have!
Tracy T.}Markham, Canada}186}371}1103}18}1}4/16/2018}[Intro Disclaimer: As a Toronto foodie, I ventured out to New York for the first time in my life with high expectations and a fully planned itinerary dedicated towards trying all the best foods in New York City!]Wow, am I disappointed or am I disappointed? After hearing from a friend's friend (NY local) give high regards to the matcha latte here, I decided to pick this cute little Japanese cafe to meet and catch up with a friend. I had checked the menu online prior to even coming to NYC so I already knew what was in store in terms of pricing and menu options. That said, I had no issue coming even though it was a little steep on pricing since I had the impression that it would be worth it. So here we were, a party of 4, seated cozily in the corner of the upstairs store and each of us had ordered one of these "supposedly amazing matcha lattes". I kid you not, I was bewildered when the drinks came - mine was literally only filled 3 quarters of the way of the skinny tall cup AND half of it was ice (pictures to prove it). I cringed thinking that I had just paid $7 for what seemed to be a sip of latte that wasn't even spectacular. The unfilled cup was totally unacceptable.Furthermore, my boyfriend decided to order the homemade mochi to add the luxury of "being on vacation". We had one of each flavour (green tea, black sesame, and earl grey chocolate) and they were honestly pretty mediocre. Without a doubt, the ice cream mochi that you can buy at Asian grocery stores here in Toronto taste better.. You can see why I was pretty disappointed in my overall experience here - it's definitely one that leans more towards the "regrets" side of my trip. It's also the only place I've given a 1 star out of my 15+ reviews during my visit to NYC.
Xiao S.}Brooklyn, NY}240}201}281}18}4}4/16/2018}The desserts here is out of the world amazing! I loved everything we ordered. It was all distinctively flavored, creative and every thing tasted absolutely well made with fresh good quality ingredients. We arrived super late at 11PM and were told there will be a table for us in a few minutes but that last order must be made by 11:15PM and last tea at 11:30PM. We were rushed out at 12AM which is their closing time. It was totally our fault for going so late and I was glad to be able to be serviced. we ordered the black sesame crème brulee, the matcha tiramisu, the sakura parfait and the mochi mochi and I honestly would recommend everything. It was well plated and my mouth is still watering thinking about it.
William W.}New York, NY}160}4}0}-1}5}4/10/2018}The best home made mochi, amazing tea, great atmosphere. The place is simply the best desert place in east village and that's saying a lot with all the great choices there.Loved! Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice atmosphere, and great refreshments and snacks!
Sasha W.}Alexandria, VA}2}33}0}-1}5}4/8/2018}This place did not disappoint! Ever since finding this place on yelp I've been meaning to come here. Finally made it today and tried 4 different items on the menu. All very delicious and visually appealing. Dessert menu has about 10 items and heavy on match and mochi. Would love to try to food next time
Ronald S.}Syosset, NY}307}14}0}-1}5}4/7/2018}This is an incredible place for tea and desserts. Bring a friend or significant other, because the layout of the place is typically meant to seat groups of two. The tea and desserts can be a bit pricey, but for the tea, you can always ask for additional hot water, so you can keep having tea pretty much until the tea leaves run out of flavor. I personally like getting the Sakura Drop (raindrop cake with sakura petals inside, and it comes with brown sugar syrup) and the Genmaicha (a type of green tea). This is a good place to go to, especially if you just had dinner and you're craving something sweet.
Salty C.}Charlottesville, VA}17}49}16}-1}5}4/7/2018}Happiness is a warm bowl of matcha!  Sweetest little tea house with really good sweets!  The Egg toast is huge, if you're into that kind of thing!
Shelly L.}New York, NY}469}52}15}-1}5}4/7/2018}I can say this with absolute confidence that this is my favorite dessert place in NY. It's small and the vibe is very intimate but can accommodate a group of 4-5 which makes it a great place to catch up with friends. I think all of the desserts look and taste amazing. Even the serveware of the matcha latte adds to the aesthetic. There is usually a wait though, which is typically a problem for me..but I am willing to wait for the desserts here
Amanda W.}New York, NY}203}93}231}18}4}4/5/2018}TLDR: cute Japanese tea room serving up delicious desserts; busy at times; friendly staffCame here with my two roommates around 5:30pm on a Saturday. We were quoted a 30-minute wait and decided to put our names down. The host told us we would receive a text when our table was ready. Luckily, the wait ended up being only 15 minutes long.The tea room is located on the second floor and is decorated in a traditional Japanese style, with simple black and white panels, bamboo details, wooden dividers, light wooden tables, black painted wooden chairs, and hanging lanterns. Although it was busy, the tea room still had a peaceful, soothing vibe. The menu was in a large, binder-style book with pictures of many of the dessert items, which we liked. We were disappointed to find out that they had sold out of their signature item, the matcha chiffon cake, but decided to order the following:Mochi Mochi, $9: warabimochi, shiratamamochi with hojicha ice cream; sweet and delicious; mochi was well-texturedBlack Sesame Créme Brulée, $9.50: topped with ice cream and a black sesame chip; sweet, slightly savory from the black sesamePremium Matcha Latte, $9.50: Cold matcha latte with green tea ice cream, red bean, whipped cream, & brown sugar syrup; delicious take on an ice cream sundaeHot Matcha Latte, $8: hot matcha latte with red beans; was served in a large bowl and was warm as opposed to hot; good but small portion, considering the priceAlthough a bit pricey, we enjoyed everything we ate at this cute tea room. Would return to try some of their other items.
Ida H.}Pasadena, CA}28}43}190}18}4}4/3/2018}Stopped here for dessert after dinner. I liked the interior decor, cozy and feels like a tea house. I got the black sesame creme brûlée and my friend got the red bean toast. The black sesame flavor was really rich and the dessert was really creamy. I enjoyed it a lot because I generally like asian desserts. The creme brûlée dessert is small but it's strong in flavor so you don't really need a big portion. We also ordered the white tea which complemented eating sweet desserts. This is a nice place to come for tea and dessert.
Anna B.}Lyndhurst, NJ}10}7}0}-1}5}3/31/2018}This is my favorite place to go for dessert! The price is a little higher than I like to spend, roughly $9-$15 per dessert, but it is so worth every penny. My boyfriend normally isn't too big on sweets, but he loves when we come here. It's hard to find hojicha ice cream in New York, but theirs is so amazing that I'm salivating just thinking about it! I think the mochi mochi is my favorite dessert I've tried so far, but everything is delicious. The premium matcha latte is a dessert in and of itself, with a big scoop of ice cream and red beans on top, and the brown sugar syrup is to die for! It is like liquid gold! If you love matcha, you have to try it. Cha an is on my list of places to take my mom with next time she comes to town, and it's definitely worth going out of your way to make the trip over.
Kelly L.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}8}0}-1}1}3/30/2018}The environment is good but the dessert is nothing special and tasteless.Their matcha cake is actually purchased from retail... and basically resell it for $11
Saba N.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}16}59}-1}1}3/28/2018}We came here on a Sunday the place was busy it's really small when you walked inside the stairs it feels like you are in a Japanese house. Asked to make reservation, was told tht was a 1 hr wait. So we put down our names and walked around the area. Within 20 min I get a text saying our tables were ready and a missed call. So I call back then the guy was like sorry it was a mistake. So we kept walking around then I get two missed calls again and I call back the guy was like no sorry again like stop fucking pranking me !! Then he call again saying somebody canceled their reservation so we can come through and we have 10 min to get their. On to the food my friend got egg toast which he said was decent and my other friend had salmon rice bowl thing it was small portion for the $16 price tag. The dessert was all green tea inspired am not a fan so was a bummer. I had oolong tea which they present in a cute tea ceremony way, that's the only upside of the weird bitter tea which was suppose to have strawberry and caramel notes smh. Only good tea was lemon verbena which was refreshing but also can be easily found in a grocery store. Overall come here for the experience to be in a cute Japanese house.  But the food and the tea was just not up to the par for the prices you pay. I was really disappointed, it's picture worthy if you want to spend $50 on some tea, food and dessert all sub par. Not coming back here ever!
Yvonne Yiyao X.}Barrington, RI}291}37}32}-1}5}3/28/2018}I'm a fan! This place is cozy and beautifully designed. The staircase was steep, but it didn't bother me much. Not sure if this place is accessible with elevators. We didn't have to wait, but as soon as we sat down the line started to form.I came here for a light brunch. Ordered an awesome set with a good balance of veggies and protein. Love the rice. Love the side dishes. The dessert included in my set is ok. Just puff pastry with cream... a sandwich shaped puff pastry. I had no room for more dessert, and I was bummed. They have very detailed descriptions of the tea flavors. Very accurate descriptions so make sure you read it carefully before making a decision. I could totally imagine myself spending hours catching up with old friends while drinking tea and having dessert. I highly recommend you to check it out.
Jamie R.}New York, NY}6}79}23}-1}3}3/25/2018}This place has slow customer service!! However, The green tea parfait is really good! We also had the jasmine pearl green tea which was also very flavorful! My husband enjoyed the affogato and hot sake. It's a little pricey for just dessert, that would be my only hesitation of coming back here on a regular basis. Also, they take foreeeever to bring you your check and don't really check up on you after they've given your food. Faster service would be great. I originally gave this 4 stars, but have been waiting 20 minutes for our check...and...still waiting!!!
Yun Z.}New York, NY}20}10}32}-1}5}3/24/2018}One of my favorite tea places. Their herbal tea is definitely worth trying, which is made from fresh tea leaves. Anything of green tea is a good bet too, so smooth and lasting.
Abdii K.}Secaucus, NJ}174}3}0}-1}4}3/24/2018}So I came here at the tail end of a breakup and this happened to be the restaurant closest to the conversation. I only mention this because the food was beautiful before it started, during the actual breakup and after it. I got the unagi and sake (because why not) and I was pleasantly surprised with the rice which cut the natural fat of the eel and made the entire dish hella light. The sake tasted a bit like dandelion and summer. HOWEVER, the best thing I had here was the black sesame crème brûlée. The first thing I noticed when this dessert was brought in was that I spilled my drink. I talk with my hands and when I get excited (like when I see a bomb dessert), my hands wild out. The second thing I noticed was that IT CAME WITH A SESAME BRITTLE. I like the crunch of a crème brûlée *yes*, I like sugar *yes*, so can I get extra *please*. Me and my date were temporarily less sad because we had brittle to share and a custard that was equal parts spiced, sweet, subtle, smoky and a general good time.
Mary D.}Houston, TX}4}23}48}-1}5}3/23/2018}My FAVORITE dessert place in New York! They have the best matcha ever. It is the closest to how good it is in Japan (my sister said). I had...- the matcha parfait - black sesame creme brûlée- premium matcha latteThey were all so delicious it was hard to figure out which one was my favorite.I would totally recommend the matcha parfait as they add  delicious chewy jelly as well as red bean in the parfait. I would also highly recommend the black sesame creme brûlée. It was very different but 10/10 in a good way. I'm from Houston and my sister and I were going to come back to eat here the very next day but we had to leave to our flight before the snow storm. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I wish they had a Cha-An in Houston ):
Ars G.}Manhattan, New York, NY}37}1}0}-1}5}3/20/2018}Not bad at all!I am definitely coming back! Good atmosphere. Thank you guyz! My lady really liked itXoxo
Yuki M.}Brooklyn, NY}11}77}0}-1}5}3/20/2018}New favorite dessert place!  MY GODDDD...it has been a couple of weeks and I am still thinking of these two alcoholic beverages i had.  the first was a jelly...i dont remember what it was called.  but it was like a delicious jelly boba with alcohol.  it gave me a little buzz which was excellent as i was chatting with my friend.  the second thing we ordered was the green tea affrogato.  wow it was soooooo delicious.  i am thinking about it now.  green tea ice cream and those black sesame candy crunch bits.  yummmmm and there is a little shot of orange liqeur to give it a bite.  yummm i love this place and cant wait to head back.  i want to try all of their desserts and next time, i will try the food too!
Cesar I.}Manhattan, NY}584}111}291}-1}5}3/18/2018}Not being a big dessert fan I came to Cha-an looking to have a post dinner white tea, that being said I'm so happy I tried this "Black Sesame Creme Brulee" if I could I would have 15 of these! The whisked matcha affogato was great too but a little pricer than it needed to be specially when the Creme Brulee was $9.Pro tip:  if you read the top part ...Price: $40/$50 for a couple of teas and desserts
Kenna K.}Boston, MA}268}28}26}-1}4}3/18/2018}Honestly, I am so sad that there is no dessert house like this in Boston. My friend had recommended me and my boyfriend to visit this tea house in St. Marks during my NYC trip, and I'm happy to say that we were not disappointed! Cha-An offers a variety of authentic Japanese desserts and teas. My boyfriend and I ordered a matcha dish, and it was truly exquisite (out of this world!). Everything from presentation to flavor and texture, it was all there. The matcha was rich and full of flavor, yet it was not the least overbearing. The ice cream added a great touch to the dessert--creamy and divine. I hope to visit again next time I'm in NYC and order an array of other unique desserts along with their herb-infused teas. The only downside to this place is that it is very pricey. However, I can't blame them because the desserts undeniably exhibit pure quality both in presentation and taste.
Sophie D.}San Francisco, CA}33}34}34}-1}5}3/17/2018}Been meaning to go here for months given all the great reviews, and I finally came here! I ordered the black sesame creme brulee, and that was fantastic. You can really tell that they put a lot of thought into it because even when you get the the bottom of the dessert, there is a brush of ground up black sesame as a final surprise. My friend said this reminded him of nostalgic oreos, but I thought it tasted amazingly of black sesame. This was a small dessert but of high quality. $9.My friend got the bento box with the tuna and commented on the high quality of the pickles. Having spent a lot of time in Japan, this comment was a big deal. He also enjoyed the tuna too. For him, the only downside was that after he was finished, he wanted more. It is a fun atmosphere with cool lighting and a cozy vibe. The wait can range from 10 minutes to an hour. Luckily, you can put your phone number down and they'll text you when the table is about ready. This gives you the freedom to walk around the area, which is also pretty fun to explore. $15 (I think)Overall, I'd go here again, but not necessarily everyday because it can be expensive.
Selena Y.}Jersey City, NJ}74}332}1091}18}4}3/15/2018}Love this little Japanese teahouse tucked away in East Village...the atmosphere reminds me a lot of the dessert places in Japan, and there are so few in NY that feel just as authentic as Cha-an. Because the entire place is rather small, the line can be extremely long during the evenings or on the weekends.I haven't been here for their savory foods, but I've always enjoyed their simple yet delicious Japanese desserts. There isn't necessary a huge list of desserts to choose from, but every time I always struggle with what to order, especially since I personally love matcha and other traditional Japanese flavors. The seasonal parfaits are my usual go-to, but I've also enjoyed their black sesame creme brulee, the mochi mochi, and their different flavors of ice cream scoops. All of which are fantastic!They also serve both tea and a few cocktails here, perfect for a quick afternoon pick-me-up or a post dinner dessert.
Ross Z.}Chattanooga, TN}40}499}158}-1}4}3/12/2018}a good place for dessert of Japan. It is a bit harder to find as the entrance is very narrow and small.
Tracy M.}New York, NY}5}12}41}-1}4}3/10/2018}(Detailed video review: youtu.be/rplWzOqiEYs) Really great atmosphere; you really get a traditional teahouse vibe, which can be said about few other places in NYC. Most of the desserts were pretty good, but some were underwhelming considering the hefty price. My friends and I ordered the Jewelry Box (sakura raindrop, a fruit biscuit thing, and various baked sweets), mochi, Black Sesame Creme Brulee, and the anmitsu. My favorite by far was the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. The consistency was creamy but not too thick, and the black sesame taste was very "aromatic," not too sweet; I REALLY enjoyed it. My friend's favorite was the mochi, which came in three flavors: earl gray chocolate, matcha, and black sesame. The mochi fillings were SUPER rich, like the earl gray chocolate one, specifically, had the richness and consistency of Royce chocolates almost.On the other side of things, the Jewelry Box (which is $30 by the way!) was somewhat of a let-down. The sakura raindrop was probably the only part of the box worth trying for the novelty of it, but the rest of the box felt just like an assortment of cookies? I'm sure the biscuit/cookies would have went well with tea, but being that it was a $30 box, they really didn't have any wow factor to them at all. The box overall just didn't feel like it was $30 worth of food. Again, the sakura drop was only part of the box that felt remotely "worth it," but that can be ordered separately by itself. So I'd recommend skipping out on the Jewelry Box, unless you are, for some reason, REALLY craving some tiny sugar cookies, and some fruit on a flat biscuit.

Josephine L.}Manhattan, NY}593}1419}20}18}3}3/10/2018}I wanted to love this spot. And I did, in a way. I loved it in theory. I loved its potential. But as with so many things that are good conceptually, the reality just didn't deliver.Kago Set (Tofu Soup, Tofu and Seaweed Salad, Salmon and Salad, veggies, Seven-Grain Rice with Pickles, Cookie with Green Tea Cream and Red Bean) - Lukewarm soup, overdressed salad, forgettable cookieChef's Selection Dessert Sampler (Whisked Matcha Affogato, Black Sesame Creme Brulee, Yukimi Zenzai (shiratama mochi with sweet, red bean porridge), Green Tea Log Cake with Red Bean Cream, Cookies) - So many great ingredients, such mixed execution. Standouts were the creme brulee and the affogato. The cake was stale and the Zenzai was bland (though that could be because I don't really like mochie--I know, I know, I should have my Asian license revoked). For tea, the Pu-Erh was nice, but the Sencha was forgettable.My main gripe was the price. It's not insanely expensive, but it's way more than you would pay at a much more authentic tea house in Asia or even Queens. I know Manhattan rents are exorbitant, but for what you pay, it just isn't that great.
Lea B.}Paris, France}20}6}2}-1}2}3/8/2018}I used to love Cha-an, it was really my place to go every time I traveled to NYC and have been a loyal customer since 2011. In my opinion, the food was authentic Japanese, home-made with small delicate portions similar to the food I had the chance to taste in Japan. The staff was also entirely Japanese. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with my last order last week. Big American portions, low quality tasteless food, it's obviously not what I expected. What happened to Cha-an? I ordered the Chakura set at 25 dollars, but the food tasted terrible and I left hungry. I won't come back.. See pics attached..
Betty W.}Philadelphia, PA}0}10}10}-1}1}3/8/2018}I used to like this place since it has decent desserts and teas despite it being overpriced and overhyped. Today I am compelled to write something to replace their arrogant and rude attitude. It was said to open at noon and I arrived at 12:05. It said on a piece of paper laced on the door that today it will open at 12:30. There were two other girls already waiting so I decided to wait too. Around 12:15 an employee came in and out, saw us and said nothing. We waisted ill 12:30 and a couple other guest came too. A waitress opened the door to tell us today they might open at 1:30 to 2pm. Oh great after half an hour standing outside in the wind and be surrounded by snow from yesterday. Why don't you tell us earlier? They are so ignorant of customers feelings especially that employee that came out around 12:15 and saw us waiting outside. Not to mention the previous visits during dinner time where everyone was treated rudely during the wait. Ya you have a lot of customers and there is always a long line during dinner time. Now seems like lunch time you refuse to treat customers with respect for their time. You have lost me. I will never come back again given this arrogance. I will also tell all my friends not to come again. Other Cha An fans, please be aware. There is never a dearth of good matcha place in the city with great customer service. Cha An does not deserve your love.
Ceylan T.}Manhattan, New York, NY}72}96}445}18}5}3/8/2018}I'm not going to repeat what has been written about the desserts at this place--BUT holy shit.  The black sesame creme brûlée was off the chain.  My cousin got pissed because I almost finished the whole thing and she only had two small bites to eat.    We sampled almost everything, but the black sesame creme brûlée takes the crown for me.  I wasn't surprised I loved this place because I absolutely love Japanese desserts.  It's because the presentation and the level of sweetness is executed perfectly.  The prices aren't cheap, but it's a Japanese place so what do you expect?  There can be a wait as the place is small and be cautious when walking up & down the stairs.  I felt as if I was transported to another world at this place.  I love, love this place.
Sungmin S.}Richmond, VA}47}322}254}18}2}3/7/2018}After 3 tries of visiting Cha-An and putting my name down on a painfully long waiting list (then giving up shortly after), I was able to score a seat this time around. And meh, it was a total waste of money. The homemade mochi is alright, good consistency but way, WAY too sweet. The sesame creme brulee is the only item on the menu worth trying in my opinion. Not too sweet, great ice cream flavor, pretty creative overall. The decor inside may look all rustic and cool for those fanatic about everything Japan, but if you look closely, furnitures are grey and filled with gunk from not having been dusted for years... kind of gross for a restaurant in my opinion. Also, the most ridiculous thing - I requested for a glass of water and found it shocking that they "cannot serve any". I get that you serve tea and would like me to order some for $$, but dude, I already ordered two desserts! I cannot recall the last time I was refused a glass of water at a teahouse. Also, they really need to do something about the indoor temperature during the winter months. We were freezing our butts off and were very eager to leave.Go to Spot for better desserts. Or go to a better cafe for actual decent, non-overpriced tea.
Michael N.}Brooklyn, NY}46}70}222}-1}5}3/7/2018}Cha-An is a really nice tea house to relax. We ordered the matcha parfait and the mochi. The Matcha Parfait was really good!
Wayne L.}New York, NY}206}35}17}-1}5}3/6/2018}Cha-an is hands down my favorite teahouse in all of New York City. Japanese for "tea hut"- walking up into Cha-an indeed feels like walking into a hut in idyllic, rural Japan.Their impressive selection of teas, desserts, and light fare, coupled with the cozy, intimate vibe make it the perfect spot for dates, or catching up with close friends and family. My personal favorite teas are the hojicha (with a rustic, earthy flavor), and of course their delicious matcha.While I'm personally not a big fan of sweets, I highly recommend their warabimochi. It's a slightly softer and less chewy version of mochi and tastes almost like jelly.It gets very crowded on weekend evenings, so do expect a wait. Luckily they do stay open pretty late.
Daisy C.}New York, NY}31}130}317}18}3}3/6/2018}Be prepare to wait at least half an hour. I came here a couple of times but was discouraged due to the long wait time. (It was over an hour wait). The good thing is that you do not have to wait at the place. You can put your name and number down and they text you 10 minutes before the table is ready. It is not ideal to wait here because the waiting area is small and a lot of people come and go. The stairway is also small and can just fit two people standing next to each other. The inside is also small. There is not a lot of seating. It is not ideal for parties more than 4. Service was slow. We sat there for over 10 mins and the staff did not take our order. We waited another 15 mins before we got the check. Not sure if it was because our table was together with the party next to us and they thought we were the same party. We ordered the black sesame creme brûlée and the green tea parfait. Creme brûlée is really good. It was creamy and rich. But for the price I wish the portion was bigger. The green tea parfait was okay. It was too much going on and the flavors doesn't really blend that well. You have to eat most of the top portion before you can get to the jelly below.I would like to come back to try the other desserts on the menu.
Sasha L.}New York, NY}875}101}2277}18}4}3/5/2018}Ahhhh!! I am in love with this place. Cha-An is a hidden gem, excellent for tea, lunch, dinner, dessert, and even have a few specialty cocktails. Really friendly staff and nice ambiance. If you're a matcha snob like me, get your butt over here and order some. Seriously. It's earthy and flavorful, as it should be. It even comes with a couple small pieces of mochi too. *swoon*Their cocktails aren't super boozy, but they're unique- one of mine had little jelly bits in it... Interesting!
Annabelle L.}New York, NY}67}76}208}-1}3}3/4/2018}Super long wait. Completely overpriced food. Desserts are actually not as good as I imagine them to be. Not visiting again.
Joyce D.}Stoughton, MA}0}26}2}-1}5}3/4/2018}Beautiful small tea house. Great atmosphere, food & desserts were amazing. Will definitely come back again when we come visit NYC.
Ani S.}Brooklyn, NY}216}117}19}18}4}2/28/2018}Each of the dishes here are aesthetically pleasing. While they aren't cheap, at least they have a nice presentation. My recommendation is to share both a tea and a dessert with someone. I haven't tried any of the actual food, but it's a great spot to go to after having dinner somewhere in St. Marks. I really liked the black sesame creme brulee, so I can recommend that as well. I will say however, the first time I went, the wait was really long, but if that's the case then it must be a busy night in manhattan in general. The other times, I haven't waited at all. So it depends on the night.
Megan L.}South San Francisco, CA}83}36}47}-1}4}2/25/2018}Really enjoyed coming here for a but of food. I liked the aesthetic and how the food came with many small side dishes. My friend and I actually did both savory and sweet, and thoroughly enjoyed both. I did notice that their parfaits sell out pretty quickly while I was there so if that is what you are looking to get make sure you go earlier in the day. Otherwise I really enjoyed the meal and everything served was so dainty and cute:) would come back.
Anna L.}Seattle, WA}2}42}110}-1}4}2/24/2018}I always make a trip out to Cha-An when I'm in nyc (once / quarter) $15 matcha parfait - red beans, matcha mousse, cereal, tea jello, ice cream, mochi, and matcha ice! Honestly everything is on the pricier side but this is probably the only item worth trying on the menu.Side tip - they have other flavors of parfaits, make sure to ask the server!
Jamie Y.}Boston, MA}270}55}41}-1}4}2/24/2018}Chan An has great desserts. Especially the green tea parfait and the seasonal desserts. I've come 2-3 times with girlfriends and on dates and left happy! I just think service could be a little friendlier since you are paying for pricey desserts!
Wanyu Z.}Washington, DC}1}20}13}-1}5}2/20/2018}Very small by super good quality of desserts. Strong matcha flavor with less sugar, healthy and nice Japanese style sweets, very authentic
Tuba H.}New York, NY}2}23}0}-1}5}2/20/2018}This is a super cozy and neatly decorated place on the second floor. A little hard to locate, but once you're there, worth the wait time. Their teas have the best aroma and the dessert is simple yet intense. Some dessert menu options might be an acquired taste, but the ambiance and experience put you in the mood to try everything.
Angel L.}Atlanta, GA}259}161}62}18}2}2/18/2018}This is so sad because the first time I came to this establishment, it was my favorite spot in New York! Can you believe it? 3 years later when I returned this is the worst service I ever got. I came here out of town to specifically go to Cha-An. When I got here I was not greeted and when I was finally greeted the ladies was so rude. I figured that it was ok since they were probably busy, rushed, or they just don't know who we are (not that it matters). We were sat in the back. We didn't even get water or any acknowledgement until 15 mins later. When she came up she didn't even apologize for the wait. The food was not good and I cannot tell of it was just the bad service or the food now just sucks. (The toast was good) My tiniest water cup made for toddlers was completely empty the rest of the night. I didn't want to leave any tip. I didn't even want to pay for the food I didn't eat. Worst NY experience ever!!
Nida H.}Troy, MI}2}31}11}-1}3}2/17/2018}I feel sad having to give this place a 3 star. I have been going here for the past 10 years of my life, it is my fav. Tea shop with only the best desserts and food options! I absolutely loved this place. NOW the service at the host stand is pathetic!! The guy was rude had the crappiest attitude and after being so excited to come to my fav spot that I go to every visit in nyc which is once a month, I felt as though he killed my puppy!!! This guy was a jerk!!! He was unaccommodating and just simply rude! I hope that this place does not change its energy! This is supposed to be welcoming and spiritual at least it used to be with me with their wonderful tea and ceremony! This douche ruined it for me. I cannot imagine it being the same ever! Also I wanted to take dessert out for my brother whose a local in east village and they would not allow the take away! WTH is that. You ppl need to get your self together! This places energy has changed!!!!!!!! I'm sad about this! RIP to my memories of this once being a peaceful space for me!
Henry Y.}New York, NY}371}711}1}-1}3}2/12/2018}This place has always been a favorite of mine--it's super Japanese, desserts have always been great and service has been prompt. However, during a recent visit, I ordered the 3-dessert tasting menu for $30...and this is where it went downhill. The menu caption reads: 'only 10 made per day' so I was a little surprised that I could still order it at 4pm in the afternoon. Little did I know that the reason why it was available was because each of the three dishes was so microscopically small. The serving sizes were a complete joke and I'm super disappointed to have ordered this item. Bummed out that an establishment such as this could try to pull a fast one.
Shanny L.}Brooklyn, NY}35}40}105}18}4}2/10/2018}Came here for desserts after dinner. We were lucky that there's not much wait (10minutes or less). We ordered duo ice cream (matcha and black sesame), hojitcha ice cream with jelly and Mochi Mochi. All tasted good. A friend ordered the mull red wine and he said it was good as well. I've been here many times over span of the past few years. I'd say they are pretty consistent on quality. As always good food places always have long line, but today is our lucky day!
Timothy F.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}2}2/10/2018}The desserts and space look elegant, but everything is terribly overpriced. We got the $30 Jewelry Box, which is beautifully presented, but nothing was particularly tasty. Some of the crackers tasted like those Danish butter cookies that come in tins, with a barely perceptible taste of something else. Overall, we came away disappointed and thinking that we would've rather had a simple scoop of ice cream. Oh, and no outside drinks. Which is reasonable, but they're such sticklers that you can't even bring in the last dregs of a cup of bubble tea.
Yumi Y.}Sarver, PA}15}2}19}-1}5}2/7/2018}Very good taste of a good shop, delicious dessert, tea is very warm, much like in Japan. Feel good service attitude is also very good
Angela C.}Cincinnati, OH}3}20}29}-1}2}2/6/2018}Came here for dessert . Me and my friend were already really stuffed from dinner, so we wanted to order one dessert. However, The waiter told us they had a minimum $ amount we had to order. We ended up ordering sesame creme brûlée and Mochi dessert which the server recommended . Creme brûlée was good but I can't say much for the mochi. It tasted boring, nothing special . The prices were  bit expensive for my taste .
Lily L.}Los Angeles, CA}545}152}175}18}3}2/2/2018}I'm starting to think I visited the wrong place, as everyone else seemed to really enjoy their experience here more. This place is beautiful, but painfully overpriced. No problem with service and no wait on a Sunday night for a party of three, but I really don't understand the hype - and I'm someone who will go out of her way (and wallet) for a good Instagram foodie photo. The raindrop cake was $7 (which you can probably get for half the price in California), and was basically glorified jello with brown syrup and sakura flowers inside. There are usually flowers in these raindrop cakes (as they'd look so plain otherwise), but I'm generally not a fan of the texture of petals in my food - not their fault. Flower flavors are another story.I was more taken aback by the $12 matcha drink that my friends got, which was served in a cup (it was more like a bowl) that was barely filled. Yes, the cup/bowl was bit on the bigger side, but it was filled less than an inch.
Chi N.}New York, NY}135}16}3}-1}3}1/31/2018}The best asian tea/ desert in the city. Servers are nice and service is fast, but the hostesses are very dumb. The wait is always long -- not because of the lack of tables. There are always open tables, but the hostesses are too dumb and slow to know how to seat people. Would've been 5 Stars if I didn't have to deal with so much stupidity. Welp.
Stephanie B.}Queens, NY}147}41}144}18}3}1/29/2018}I used to love Cha-An tea house and bring my friends and family over. However, on this last occasion, it was disappointing.There's a wait -- and I knew that. The lady who was overseeing that didn't ask anyone for their names, but anyone who went up to her was somehow put on a list. Made no sense. Either ask everyone for their names or don't take any. Being consistent is an art. Their menu had only one savory/salty item, which is really what we were all craving. Boooo. It's mostly desserts and I get it. Their one item, the salmon on toast, was pretty bad. The tea selection has also gotten smaller -- as has their will to add more hot water. Eventually they did, but you have to ask. $9 for a tiny cup of tea is ridiculous even by New York standards. Overall, the desserts weren't anything to write home about, the tea was overpriced, and their menu could use more variety. However, I must admit that I may be biased as I know what Cha-An used to be and feel like there's been a decline in quality. Overhyped. 1 star for the Toto toilet. Not kidding.
Ke Z.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}5}13}-1}5}1/29/2018}Nice environment and atmosphere, also the desert, but you alway need to wait for seats!
Phyllis Q.}Flushing, NY}36}8}16}-1}3}1/26/2018}Got here at around 11:30 pm (30 mins before closing) to meet friends from out of town, confident that we had missed the boat for the jewelry box. We did not, which was understandable after we got it. For $30, both the quality, quantity, and flavor was pretty disappointing. Wish we had got something cheaper that was likely tastier. The tea was good and the amount of options was fun to choose from and try. Would likely not come back nor recommend with all the other options in NYC but was a fine experience to have.
Simon C.}East Brunswick, NJ}37}256}188}18}4}1/25/2018}A 2nd floor little hideout where you can try some exquisite Japanese teas and desserts with the price to match. We had the green tea lattes and the black sesame créme brulée. All are very flavored and tasty.
Anna K.}New York, NY}11}34}11}-1}3}1/23/2018}I came here with a friend a few weeks ago for the first time.  I love the decor and makes me feel as though I'm in a traditional tea house.My friend and I each ordered a tea; I had the Scarlet Glow and it was okay.  I will come back to try another type but I did like the clear pot it came in.We both shared the Jewelry Box; they only serve 10 a day and for some reason we can't imagine that it gets sold out.  We arrived at around 8:30pm and they were still available.  To be honest, we were very disappointed in the quantity and quality.  We had some cookies, a raindrop cake, some small cakes and other assortments.  It wasn't a lot and we were under the impression that we'll get miniature versions of their hit dessert items such as their chiffon cake or creme brulee.  We both did not see the exclusivity or uniqueness of getting the Jewelry box.  It was not worth the $30.I will come again because I like the ambiance and I want try their other desserts.
Crystabel R.}Fairfax Station, VA}140}254}114}18}5}1/23/2018}Stopped by here after a birthday dinner at momofuku ssam bar for a sweet bite. I'm crazy for asian desserts and the black sesame creme brûlée was calling my name. From the reviews, I was a little intimidated by the "strong" sesame taste but it was nothing but delicate to me. The creme was balanced and the ice cream wasn't too sweet either. I guess the strongest sesame taste was the cracker which was my least favorite part of the dessert but added a nice crunch. My boyfriend ordered the soba beer because he doesn't like desserts and I actually really enjoyed the mild buckwheat flavor. If I'm ever in New York again, I'd love to come back !
Anna H.}Dumbo, NY}85}121}3}-1}5}1/22/2018}I have fond memories of my husband and I visiting this restaurant when we were dating. We still go back, it's very romantic. It is a little hidden gem in Manhattan.They have an amazing (real) tea selection and the deserts are top rate. We especially like to visit for desert.The decor is beautiful and relaxing. I also love the bathrooms, the place is just beautiful.It is easy to talk here and a great place to go with friends in a group.The servers are very nice and attentive. Keep in mind, it does get pretty busy on the weekends though.
Sonia P.}Alexandria, VA}288}224}1185}18}4}1/21/2018}My sister loves going to this teahouse in St Marks place and I try to swing by this place whenever I'm in the city. The place is located on the second floor and make sure to look for the sign since its a little hard to find. I usually come here after dinner for tea and cake. I always get the Matcha Chiffon Cake with coconut milk sauce. It is soft, not too sweet and the green tea flavor is perfect. Top it off with their classic matcha latte. I can never get bored of green tea lol.Hopefully on my next visit, I can finally order the jewelry box since they only have 10 servings a day.
Sean L.}Queens, Queens, NY}26}6}15}-1}4}1/20/2018}A very quite place to have a brunch. Their food tastes delicious, but may hurt your wallet a little. Nice to have visited it once in a while
Kathy G.}Laguna Niguel, CA}237}157}592}-1}5}1/18/2018}Nice dessert! I especially loved the green tea parfait and the toast! They both tasted great and wasn't too sweet. The jewelry box was not that impressive but also tasted good. The chocolate soufflé was great also.
Livia C.}San Francisco, CA}0}8}0}-1}4}1/15/2018}We started going there since 10 years ago and I still love it there.If I could throw a party - any sort of party, and if they allow it, I would totally do it there anytime.We used to go there anytime without much waiting, they seat people leisurely and people are very relax and chill, that was 5-10 years ago.Since the last 2 years, I could never dine there because of the line. The wait seems to be a norm now and when the day is good, it takes 15 mins, and sometimes you just don't know how long it takes.We got seated in 15 mins this time (and didn't quit the line this time), the same old looking binder menu brings back all the good'young memory, and I already know what I want, since they do have seasonal dishes. I loved everything that I ordered, a hot matcha latte with red bean - I order that every single time with different variation. And their desserts too, I must have tried everything already and loved most of them.However, while I was still tasting the spoonfulness of Anmitsu jelly in my mouth, the server gave us the check and I was shocked. Of course noting can stay exactly the same forever, especially for restaurants that constantly has a long line waiting for them to clear up; but that moment just throw me off. Imagine you go to a ramen place and am still eating your ramen and someone needs to drop off the check right as you put your ramen in your mouth.Anyhow, I know they want to turn the tables so that more people get to enjoy the experience and not be turned down, so I don't blame them.Even that, I will still come back, I love this place so much it is a much needed escape from the busy NYC streets, so I am still thankful after all these 10 years and many many visits.
Rick M.}Saint Petersburg, FL}151}15}0}-1}4}1/15/2018}Awesome menu. Tea service was wonderful with great selections. Service was also on point. Quiet ambiance and a smaller venue, so an intimate space that's well designed and thoughtful. Would definitely return.
Angela Y.}New York, NY}17}58}31}-1}3}1/15/2018}Dessert tastes OK, but the portion is tiny and it's not cheap. The teapot is small, so we had to ask for refill a couple of times. We went there on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy.
Sisi W.}New York, NY}1}34}1}-1}3}1/15/2018}My partner and I were really excited to try this place after seeing all their delicious dessert offerings and because we had a wonderful time at Té Company a few weeks back and wanted to try more tea houses in New York City.ENVIRONMENTThis is not the environment of a normal tea house. The decor is wonderful but the tables are close together and the customers really love to talk very loudly. I expected to come here and be able to enjoy a good book with my latte and desserts, and boy was I wrong. Instead, we couldn't not listen to the very loud conversations immediately next to us.MATCHA LATTEI tried the hot matcha latte that comes with red bean. It's really much too sweet, came out lukewarm and while there is milk in the drink, it's really not a latte. No foam. If this is your go-to order elsewhere, I don't think you'll enjoy the version they have here. That said, if you're looking for something sweet to drink, I'd try one of their cold matcha lattes here.DESSERTSWe tried the black sesame creme brulée and their homemade mochi (one of each of their three flavors). I love love love creme brulée overall and I think they did a good job here, probably the best thing I got. The creme actually tastes like black sesame and the ice cream and hardened sugar on top were excellent. The homemade mochi was pretty fresh, but the fillings are very intense, so be ready to feel a bit stuffed after trying them. The presentation was adorable. I'd recommend taking someone to try these if they've never had specialty asian deserts before and you're in the area, but I don't actually expect to come back here given the other options in the city.SERVICEThey're understaffed, so while it was difficult to flag someone down, it's easy to understand. They don't have that many seats, but with three people running around and one of them also needing to be host, the entire staff was clearly working very hard. You just have to really push to get their attention to get water, order and get your check.
Chi T.}New York, NY}205}7}4}-1}3}1/14/2018}We ordered the expensive jewelry box which was very underwhelming. Definitely do not order this box as you can easily get most of the desserts in the box for less than $5 at a supermarket. Service is ordinary. Food is overpriced. Atmosphere is relaxing and calm - the only thing worth coming back for.
Wendy C.}New York, NY}3}200}187}-1}5}1/14/2018}Great place for authentic, creative, elaborate japanese desserts. We came in on a Saturday night and were luckily able to get seated right away without a wait. The service was friendly and the desserts were tasty without being overly sweet or heavy. The ambience is great for date night. I would subtract a star because they mixed up one of the two items we ordered, but they apologized and resolved the issue quickly.
Jennifer N.}New York, NY}106}31}58}-1}4}1/14/2018}This is a cute spot for unique desserts with a Japanese flair to it.  All of the desserts are aesthetically pleasing but have good flavor as well and aren't too sweet.My friend and I ordered the matcha affogato which has a shot of matcha and a shot of orange liqueur to pour over two scoops of matcha ice cream, and the black sesame creme brûlée to share.  The orange liqueur with the matcha shot was an interesting addition to an already not-so traditional take on an affogato.  Both my friend and I love creme brûlée desserts and knew that we had to order the black sesame creme brûlée here to try.  The ice cream and the creme brûlée were both delicious. I just wish the caramelized sugar on top had a bit more crunch, because who doesn't love cracking the top layer of a creme brûlée?!
Sammy T.}New York, NY}181}30}100}-1}5}1/14/2018}Super cute place to have tea and desserts and have a good chat with friends. Space is little small so that wait can be a lit long but very worth it! The interior gives it a very authentic Japanese feel to it and the staffs are very nice.
Cindy N.}Wichita, KS}0}6}29}-1}4}1/13/2018}Uhm.. everything was alright. Nothing too special. But the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée was the best and the unagi was pretty good too. Service was alright but pretty pricey for a cup of tea that barely had any tea. Might come back again for some sesame creme brulee.
Winnie N.}Rockville, MD}152}73}24}18}4}1/12/2018}Adorable little tea house. We got the tuna donburi, the eel donburi, matcha latte, and the jewelry box. The food was all delicious and came out in a timely manner. The staff could have done a better job keeping our water glasses full, and checking out took forever (I think the waitress was new or something, because we sat at the bar and watched her try to split the bill in two). Great place to spend a rainy afternoon
Fiona L.}Loir-et-Cher, France}512}47}10}-1}2}1/11/2018}The vibe is cool and interesting, but the food was not. Friends and I stopped by for dessert on a Tuesday night. There was no wait, but I hear the small dining space gets crowded on Fridays and weekends.Our dessert experience can be described as a sad diminuendo of desserts. We ordered three.The Mochi Mochi has a ball of tea-flavored ice cream surrounded by two different types of mochi. The white one is used in other desserts, so if you share desserts with friends, there are several other desserts that use the same white mochi ball. The herbal green one is not in many dishes, and that was the star of the mochi mochi dish. It was delightful, not too sweet, and very tasty. The portion is perfect for one person, and you wouldn't want to share it anyways.The Hojicha Anmitsu can only be described by analogy. If the Mochi Mochi was your ex, the Hojicha Anmitsu is the rebound. It's OK, but nothing compared to your ex. You're interested by the herbal jelly and pretty presentation, but you finish feeling a little sad and regretful, wishing you could go back to the Mochi Mochi.Lastly, the Green Tea Chiffon cake. It was a dessert with so much potential. The cake is delicious and full of green tea flavor. It's airy, squishy, and soft - everything a cake should be. The cake is paired with small dollops of whipped cream, which sounds logical, but the strong green tea flavor of the cake gives it an almost dry consistency. The plate would have benefitted from an ice cream, or maybe larger dollops of whipped cream. The bill came out to ~$37 for three desserts. We didn't have tea, although many do go to Cha-An just for tea. Our waitress didn't give us water until we asked for it and she didn't refill our empty cups. It's a shame. The vibe is intimate and unique, but I think there are better places for desserts in the area.
Amy L.}Exton, PA}4}106}993}-1}5}1/6/2018Updatedreview}visit NYC again and this is still the only "green tea" place for me. Comparing to other places offering green tea stuffs, what Cha-An offers are all desserts that you can really taste "tea" flavor. We ordered Matcha Latte(Premium),  Black Sesame Crème Brûlée and Sakura Drop. no need to say that Black Sesame Crème Brûlée is packed with sesame flavor and Matcha Latte(premium) is perfectly sweetened and delicious. For Sakura Drop, it is beautiful but I am more expressed by its black sugar sauce.
Siri C.}Brooklyn, NY}473}16}262}-1}5}1/5/2018}This is probably one of the best tea places in the area. My friend and I dropped by after dinner and had the Scarlet Glow tea and the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée. We could not have asked for a more scrumptious end to our meal. The scarlet glow was perfectly sweetened and refreshing. It had the fruity flavor with a slightly tart aftertaste. The creme brulee was to die for. Simply melted in our mouths.Pro-tip: if you haven't used a Japanese toilet they have one! Possibly the warmest seat in all of NYC on a cold wintery day
Yuki U.}New York, NY}0}43}0}-1}3}1/3/2018}Honestly I expected too much... Premixed maccha latte was good and the atmosphere was not bad. However I couldn't be satisfied with other foods such as their maccha ice cream and houjicha anmitsu.I didn't see any Japanese staffs. I'm sorry but I don't think you can have great Japanese foods and service at this restaurant...
Billy P.}Queens, NY}12}5}0}-1}3}1/2/2018}Came here five minutes after they opened on a weekday, but there were already two parties by the time we were seated. This would later provide a very accurate foreshadowing of how crowded the place would be in the next half hour. It was almost ridiculous how fast the place filled up, but then again, there are only a scant number of seats to begin with.My cousins and I, a party of three, were seated all the way at the back next to the windows. In hindsight, this was probably for the best seeing as we were somehow magically separated from the rest of the people that quickly filled the place. Not that this is a bad thing, but there were definitely more aesthetically pleasing places to sit, per se the popular "hut" area that surrounds you in a very traditional tearoom setting. But I digress.If I could break down my feelings, I'd give:A 5/5 for the ambienceA 4/5 for the service, and;A meager 2/5 for the food. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that this place had a solid 4/5 rating on Yelp, I probably would have never stepped in here.The ambience is nice, and the servers were polite, although there was a small mix-up over what the desert of the day for a meal set was versus what the "specialty" desert of the day was.However, what really let us down was the food. It was just so...mediocre. I got the unagi set for around $15, while my cousins shared the $25 set. On top of that, the portions were so, so tiny. I had a good five seconds of shock while my companions took photos.But I was willing to overlook the portion size if the food was good! Which is was not. I got a huge bowl with two tiny pieces of unagi--which was probably just a single slice of unagi cut into two--over a ridiculous amount of white rice that was submerged in an ocean of unagi sauce. I couldn't even finish the last of the rice because there was just so much of cloying, thick sauce to contend with. My taste buds gave up.My cousins, on the other hand, enjoyed their meal. They also ordered the jasmine pearl tea with the set, which brought the set to $30, but the tea was delicious, although the extra $5 for just a SINGLE cup of tea was just...mind-boggling. Then came the desert, which was a choice between a green tea pudding or a pound cake. We chose the pudding, and when we got it, it was the size of a thimble. No joke, I literally called the server back over and asked her if this really was all of the desert. Nevertheless, we made sure to scrap up every last bit of over-priced pudding.The check came up to around $50 dollars, which we generously tipped because we're not monsters and the servers weren't responsible for the tiny portions. Overall, we paid around $60 for a meal that didn't fill three grown adults. Go if you want a nice ambience and nice tea, but stay away if you're looking to get full.
Lina C.}New York, NY}0}27}41}-1}2}1/2/2018}Came here for lunch with friends and was pretty disappointed. The atmosphere was pretty and peaceful, very nice for dates. However I was sitting right by the stairway and it was super cold every time people entered. I ordered a tofu ganmo and black sesame creme brulee. The tofu ganmo was way too salty which made it unpleasant to eat. And the creme brulee was a disappointing twist on the traditional creme brulee. The service was good but the price and the food was definitely not worth it, I'm not planning to return. Also $7 for a small pot of tea is a bit much. I'm used to NYC prices but was still miffed at the price.
Mei Z.}Charles Town, WV}23}2}1}-1}1}12/28/2017}Do not order the jewelry box. Paid $30 for cookies and fruit that you can get from Walmart. And it does not look like the picture on the menu. Also the portion is tiny. Their matcha latte is terrible. The taste is very light and thin. You can get better matcha from Asian market and make your own. It taste like half a packet matcha powder with lots of water.
Susan L.}New York, NY}160}195}1137}18}3}12/28/2017}Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm and there was only a 15-20min wait which was not bad. There was a lot of people waiting for seats and my friend and I managed to get one around like 10minutes. This place is pretty small so you will have to put your number with the hostess in the front. When you get your table, there will be a text saying press "1 or 2" to hold your spot. It's a 10min grace period to hold your spot. Good thing we just walked around the are so we got back pretty quick. Their menu is pretty small for food. They also have another separate menu for desserts and drinks. I decided to get the hot matcha latte with red bean and the Unagi Kabayaki. I expected more eel for the Unagi Kabayaki beau case, their were only four pieces and the rest was rice. I felt like the Unagi Donburi is a rip off. I could actually buy my own eel for less than $15 and make my own Donburi. I wouldn't get this again but the taste was okay. 3.5/5 stars. The Matcha latte on the other hand was really good. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and it had red bean paste in it. I rate it 4.5/5 stars. On the other hand, the service here is decent. The waitresses do check on the customers to refill the tea and are polite. I would probably come back here again. They do have very cute decoration but not the best lighting.
Mengjia Y.}Jersey City, NJ}34}83}384}-1}5}12/27/2017}Quite and beautiful environment. The dessert is great and I would come again. The eel is also excellent.
Luci B.}Queens, NY}118}1190}1981}18}4}12/26/2017}Really cute spot! Located up a flight of stairs, it's cozy, small, and intimate. We came in on Christmas Eve and they were playing soft jazz, tables occupied by couples making eyes at each other- it was perfect. On the menu they mention they do enforce a 1 hour time limit for seating when things get busy. We ordered the matcha chiffon cake: truly featherweight cake with a little coconut milk, toasted coconut bits, and a green tea mouse. Light, not too sweet, and very tasty. It was a perfect accompaniment to the tea, Pu-erh Leaf, with notes of soil and leather, which sounds aggressive but was actually very balanced and as the menu described it, smooth.The boy had a mulled wine which was far too floral, a little hard to drink actually. It's presentation was cute but we'd order something else in the future. A great spot for after dinner tea, or a first stop on date night!
Mollie G.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}12/21/2017}Hidden gem. Best secret retreat from the city! Delicious match latte, zen environment, love coming here!
Edward W.}New York, NY}357}1236}2160}18}4}12/20/2017}This is a great place for afternoon tea and dessert. There is one table that is really unique cause it has the feel of a traditional Japanese tea house.The homemade mochi here was fantastic. It came in three different flavors, earl grey chocolate, black sesame, and green tea. My favorite flavors were the black sesame and green tea. The Earl grey chocolate was a bit too sweet for my liking. The mochi itself is super soft. Tried the matcha parfait and matcha latte here as well. Matcha latte was not sweet at all. The matcha parfait has lots of jelly and a variety of our sweets that were tasty. I'm a huge fan of homemade mochi so that was my favorite. Can't seem to go wrong with any other desserts.
Lynn Z.}New York, NY}56}55}168}-1}5}12/17/2017}Beautiful place. Great service and very delicious dessert. Highly recommend mochi mochi and the matcha cake. Both were so delicious!
Pasha T.}New York, NY}36}77}88}-1}4}12/17/2017}We stepped there to get some desserts. Place is extremely cute and cozy. It doesn't look like a typical hipster place, u prob won't take a thousand pics for ur Instagram, but it has its own authentic atmosphere. Desserts were decent. Service was good enough.
Kat T.}New York, NY}230}246}200}18}5}12/14/2017}Love the tea, service, decor, ambiance, everything! Gets crowded but if it's not too cold out you can walk around east village to pass the time. Generally not into sweets but I am into their sesame creme brûlée. Yum! Get a pot of tea to share and enjoy some tranquility in the middle of the city.
Jake L.}Vancouver, Canada}11}1}2}-1}5}12/4/2017}Wow. 10/10. Would eat again. Holy. I'm really speechless.This desert is so good it makes me want to order it again and eat it for my main course. It reminds me of "Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma" makes me think that I'm floating in the air as the taste of the desert just melts and flows through my mouth. #WouldEatAgain
Hadley H.}New York, NY}98}93}118}18}5}12/4/2017}So.  Freaking.  Beautiful.  Cha An reminded me of my favorite tea house hangs from when I lived in Kyoto.  I visited Cha An on a Saturday night, and the line was down the stairs and through the door.  It was worth the wait.I started my visit with their seasonal parfait.  The satsumaimo (Japanese sweet potato) ice cream that it featured is now ranking as my favorite ice cream flavor ever!  The satsumaimo cake was also perfection.  Also featured in the parfait were kurosato(dark brown sugar) jelly, nashi pears chunks, and sweet senbei.  The parfait was topped off with a beautiful momiji maple leaf.My friend ordered the houjicha ice cream with mochi.  Also so good!We split the jewel box dessert afterwards... we kept wanting more!  The jewel box is a three layered box of treats.  The cafe serves a limited number each day.  The black sesame paste inside of mochi was probably my favorite from this selection.  It has a rich, nutty, almost salty flavor.  I think that it could be easily incorporated into savory dishes.  The yuzu/sakura mochi was also a thing of beauty, with a pickled sakura blossom on top.  One layer of the jewel box featured more conventionally American style cake and cookie desserts, in chocolate and matcha flavors.  Skip dinner, come hungry!  You'll want to sample all that Cha An has to offer.
Kim H.}New York, NY}539}187}131}-1}5}12/3/2017}Amazing Desserts and Tea!!Finally came to this place after eyeing it for a while!  And, I was so impressed and am in love!!  Being a huge fan of anything matcha and especially Japanese desserts, my friend and I decided to come here for desserts and tea/drinks.I was astounded by the extensive menu, since they also had a full dinner menu and all their special holiday desserts.  We decided, after a long time pouring over the menu, to try the matcha chiffon cake (with ice cream), matcha ice cream float, and matcha mochi dessert.  The matcha chiffon cake was definitely the best!!  It was so beautiful...we, at first, didn't even want to eat it because it was so pretty!  But, the matcha cake part was so rich and full of perfect matcha flavor.  And, the ice cream and red beans blended so well with the rest of the cake.  The float was really good, as well!  And the matcha mochi was great too, very chewy and not too strong.  Overall, Cha-An really has amazing matcha and has great desserts!  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the dessert menu.The venue is so pretty inside, and I love how the place has separate rooms-making it feel like a Japanese tea garden in a way.  I really liked the mini waterfalls they had everywhere, and the small touches of vases, sakura flowers, etc.  What a wonderful place!!
Conan W.}South Central Houston, Houston, TX}28}13}0}-1}4}12/2/2017}Very friendly service. But the sencha was not served properly. The tea should be poured out to the last drop, instead of leaving in the pot. Food is more American Japanese than authentic, still delicious.
Tiffany L.}New York, NY}335}73}117}18}4}11/29/2017}Came here on a Tuesday around 5PM and there was no wait. It's definitely a cozy place -- dim lighting and dark wood make it great for a rainy day escape. I ordered the Keemun Mao Feng (rich, red fruit, chocolate). It smelled like chocolate which was interesting. They also give you a glass teapot so you can refill the glass yourself. I'd say the teapot lasted me 3.5 full cups. For sharing tea and small bites, I'd recommend this place, but be warned it is a bit pricy when considering the size of the dessert and the cost.
Chaewon L.}Somerville, MA}0}17}49}-1}4}11/28/2017}Hmmm so this was my first time here,Long wait time and really crowded placeOne of the things that impressed me was the interior here, it's beautifully decorated with some Japanese style design The menus themselves are pretty pricey, I cannot really say they worth it though But they are amazingly pretty!It's not probably my favorite favorite dessert place, but I would go again if I wouldn't need to wait for so longggg (waited for like 40 mins)Maybe because it was during thanksgiving week or whatsoever, still ..Oh and they had the menu sold out which was the ultimate reason I went thereSo, make sure you don't visit here at crowded time, and make sure they have what you visit here for!
Judy K.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}582}21}56}-1}3}11/28/2017}I've been here - in&out a few times. Every time there's always a line with 1hr wait or more. This time we decided to waited the 45 mins on thanksgiving eve. The space is small and compacted. I recommend not bringing too many people because you'll be waiting even longer. Table of two gets seated quicker. They have a good selection of tea and desserts but definitely over priced with the small portion that's given. The waitress' are patient and friendly. One thing I liked about this place is they won't rush you to leave. It is a very cozy tea house & desserts for when you are in the St. Marks area.
Amy M.}New York, NY}127}15}4}-1}4}11/23/2017}LOVE this spot. Amazing desserts and tea, and such an adorable interior. I always come here when I'm in the east village and have time for a quick bite or need a matcha fix. They have the best matcha green teas, with the option of adding red bean and vanilla ice cream, YUM. As for food, I've gotten both the salmon toast and raspberry butter toast. Both are unbelievably amazing. Definitely a place that doesn't disappoint!!
Z C.}Agoura Hills, CA}37}186}14}-1}5}11/21/2017}Only came for the desserts, but they were delicious. Had the matcha smoothie, raindrop-like cake, and some other matcha-themed goodies. I would recommend sticking with the matcha flavored desserts, definitely their specialty.
Emma Z.}Philadelphia, PA}2}52}136}-1}5}11/19/2017}My favorite Japanese tea house dessert spotand tapas place!! Now accepts credit card  now I can go crazy and order everything on the menu-which are all insanely delicious! Especially anything with mochi's
Bill W.}Queens, NY}2}19}7}-1}5}11/16/2017}They have very good matcha food  i love  me and 3 friends went together its about 15-20 for each person!
Jolene H.}New York, NY}34}91}75}-1}4}11/13/2017}Always a wait unless you head there at a weird hour but the desserts are worthy.Big fan of mochi so this always hits the spot! It's delectably chewy and matcha ice cream always is a welcome! Sesame Crème brûlée - so much better than I expected - definitely a crowd pleaser. So fragrantly done (doesn't taste like your regular sesame desserts) Ambiance is dark (but comfortable) and relatively quiet even though the place doesn't seat too many.Prices are higher than average but it's NYC... Food is just okay so I'd head here more for the desserts.
Kelly Z.}Hempstead, NY}0}23}26}-1}4}11/11/2017}Cha-An is a small Japanese tea house for some tea and dessert. I love their quite vibe. Enjoyed chatting with my friend and enjoyed the hot tea in a cold evening.
Jenny W.}New York, NY}20}595}133}-1}4}11/8/2017}I came here for the first time years ago and loved it. It's such a quiet and quaint tucked away spot in the East Village. Tea was great, and I remember enjoying the desserts.My recent experiences have been more mixed. The interior is the same and it's still a cute tucked away spot. They now have a rule (or perhaps it's always been around I just didn't notice the first time) that you must order over $7 per person, which means each person must get a drink or dessert. I guess this makes sense given their popularity and tight space but when all you want is to share one dessert with a friend, this rule can be annoying. Also desserts and drinks can be pricy here but I guess it makes sense - that's all they sell and if people stay here for a long time chatting away (as with the nature of a tea house) you have to make the time up somehow.I've tried:Matcha chiffon cake - Really good, possibly my fave of the desserts I've tried. Super light and delicious, and loved the coconut milk sauce that came with it. The almonds mixed in to add a nice touch as well. I only wish there was more sauce - eating the cake on its own can be copying - by the end I had none left to help balance the cake. Ice cream dup (Black Sesame and Hojicha) - Luckily we also got an order of ice cream, which was a great complement to the chiffon cake. Solid ice cream although kind of pricy considering it's just 2 scoops for $7. The hojicha ice cream is my favorite, it's a super unique flavor I've never seen elsewhere and it's this sweet almost molasses like / caramelized flavor. The black sesame was also very good, full of black sesame flavor although you could also get a whole pint of black sesame ice cream at Chinatown Ice Cream factory for $12 so there's that. Hojicha anmitsu - Very underwhelmed by this. The mochi wasn't an ideal consistency, and I remember finding this entire thing a bit too bland in general except for the red bean syrup which was far too sweet. Sad part is I think I loved this dish years ago.Green tea parfait - Parfait was quite good and a far better choice than the anmitsu. Somehow the constituent parts come together a lot better to make this dish better balanced and flavorful without being too sweet.
Roxanne O.}Freehold Township, NJ}63}495}571}18}5}11/7/2017}A cute little dessert place tucked in St. Mark's. We came here on a Friday afternoon and it was completely empty aside from one other table. We had trouble deciding what we wanted because there were so many options we had never heard of before. We ended up getting the mochi (for reference, it is not ice cream mochi lol) and the hojicha anmitsu. I always love that asian desserts arent super sweet. The anmitusu had such a wide variety of textures from red bean, ice cream and jelly and was super fun to eat. A little pricey as just these two desserts came out to be over $20.  I want to try their savory foods next time!
T T.}Manhattan, NY}0}35}4}-1}1}11/5/2017}The food is alright but the service is really sub par.  The staff seemed completely oblivious to their shortcomings and oversights.
Rebekah C.}Great Neck, NY}1}32}72}-1}4}11/3/2017}Great place for japanese tea and dessert. I always come to get the black sesame creme brûlée. The parfaits are also good. The new fall parfait is also unique and yummy I gave 4 stars since it's a bit pricey for dessert.
Cindy L.}Brooklyn, NY}19}7}93}-1}3}10/31/2017}It is not that special what I expected it. 1oz Mocha green tea cost $12 and taste not that surprised. Also they don't have too many choices of dessert to serving. A little disappointed what I expected it.
Virginia C.}Denver, CO}2566}814}2736}18}4}10/31/2017}Tight quarters but ahh- this is New York, so so dessert, amazing tea, and it's cute inside.This is fantastic place for a date or a meetup with your best friend and you want somewhere quiet that isn't a large bar. Things to Do:1) Lots of Tea and I particularly like the roasted rice green tea 2) Sesame Creme Brulee3) Pass on that Green Macha Cake or Creme RollsYou come here for a good cup of tea and the atmosphere. But if you are in need of curing your sweet tooth, find another bakery.
Alan N.}New York, NY}245}154}374}18}3}10/23/2017}This place is okay for just their desserts. My girlfriend found this place and thought it was really cute so we tried it for dessert. I agree, this place is really cute and would be a great place to bring a date. I have a feeling most girls would really like the vibe of this place. Its very Japanese and the presentation of the food is on point. But I have to knock it for the price. My girlfriend and I paid $22 for a matcha ice drink and a sesame creme brulee. I thought the matcha drink was delicious. While my girlfriend loved the sesame creme brulee, I thought it was kind of small for what they charged ($10). It was beautifully crafted and looked amazing, but I wish it was a bit bigger. They have a lot of other instagram-worthy desserts that people on other tables were eating. They had the raindrop cake, parfaits and the Treasure Box. The treasure box was $30 but it did look beautiful to look at. This is a great place to impress a date. They also serve real food too but we only got the desserts here.
Andrew C.}Redwood City, CA}318}515}63}18}5}10/15/2017}This is definitely a place you want to go if you're craving any sort of Asian / fancy dessert. This place has a very unassuming entrance where you need to walk up some stairs. Once you make it up the stairs, it's so worth it.What to get:Black sesame creme brulee: Not your typical creme brulee, by any means. Represents a black sesame-flavored ice cream/cream with a cracker. Very good.Mochi mochi mochi: I think that's what it was called, but fresh-made mochi + ice cream + goodness. Also definitely worth getting.Each dessert was about ~10 bucks and had a nice presentation. Overall, solid spot.
Ashley Y.}Bensalem, PA}52}127}319}18}5}10/15/2017}My friend recommended me coming here and it was the best decision ever. It's such a cute little place. I got to sit inside the little hut. (They were busy but we didn't have to wait for more than 5-10mins)The menu had a variety of desserts, snacks, and drinks. They also serve alcohol too. I liked how the menu was simple and it also had photos if you're unsure of what you want to order.We ordered a Matcha Latte Deluxe and Black sesame creme brûlée. They were both very delicious! The prices are average and service was good.I will definitely come back next time when I'm in New York and try the other items. If you're in EV, definitely stop by after dinner too!
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}4}10/14/2017}Nice place to relax and eat. Good food, good decor and good service. Will be coming back.
Natasha V.}New York, NY}47}3}0}-1}5}10/12/2017}I go to Cha-an almost every weekend because it's just that good. My friends and I love the atmosphere and (of course) the desserts. The jewelry box is so aesthetically pleasing and tastes amazing. Line can get a bit crazy, though, especially during weekend nights.
Peter H.}New York, NY}354}144}33}18}5}10/10/2017}All my friends seem Japan-obsessed and love coming here. I've joined the party many times.Hojicha Anmitsu is my favorite dessert, with such a great mix of Japanese morsels of different textures. All the teas are delicately brewed, and there's a wide selection.Be prepared for a wait. Sitting in the corner with the sorta internal cottage/booth/thing is lots of fun.
Sonya Z.}Cary, NC}125}148}49}18}5}10/9/2017}The 5 star rating is almost entirely for their summer special which was a matcha shaved ice. The matcha was really fresh and they served it on the side with condensed milk so you could control how much and when to pour it on the shaved ice. It was a huge portion and really refreshing - perfect for summer. The toppings were light and yummy as well. It was one of the best shaved ice desserts I've had . Their food is a bit pricey (I believe the shaved ice was ~$10, which is definitely on the pricier side for shaved ice), and they do have a table minimum. We ordered the shaved ice and a tea and it met the $15 minimum.
Susan X.}Claremont, CA}5}367}152}-1}4}10/4/2017}Hojicha anmitsu-good. They run out of hojicha ice cream. Green tea ice cream instead. Not a lot of green tea flavor. Seasoned sakura on top. Canned chestnut is pretty sweet. White mochi is very chewy. Excellent quality. Brown jelly that doesn't resemble anything. Mochi mochi-good. Sweet red bean paste underneath green tea ice cream. Light cream on top. The matcha mochi isn't as good as the white mochi.
Uyen D.}Tampa, FL}100}174}1736}18}5}10/4/2017}Every time I'm in NYC now I make sure to stop by cha an tea house! Usually when I go it's later in the day and usually no line however have been told wait can get extensive. Don't let that dissuade you though - hands down the most beautiful, light, airy and delicate Japanese desserts you will ever come across!! Also there's a good amount of tea options to help you digest and just relax after a long days work or a big dinner!My previous visits have been nothing but pleasant. Great service and they do not rush you. There are seasonal options but the black sesame creme brûlée and the matcha mochi parfait are delicious and available year round!!Today I tried The Sakura water drop cake with brown sugar topping. Essentially it is made of jello with an edible Sakura flower inside. The dessert itself is pretty flavorless but the sugar sauce makes it's good. I probably would not get it again however it is Instagram worthy!!For now it is my fav dessert place in the city! Keep it a secret though don't want lines :p
Claire L.}New York, NY}1}85}86}-1}4}10/3/2017}The installation of the TOTO washlet was a new concept to the city years ago. Overtime, the high quality of food and services have attracted more customers and turned Cha-An into a casual hub. The lunch sets and seasonal offerings have always been good but relatively expensive. My favorite is their black sesame creme brulee.
Cai I.}Brooklyn, NY}111}13}3}-1}5}10/3/2017}You have to go upstairs to enter the restaurant. It's decor is different from other businesses with it's traditional Japanese architecture. I was seated fairly quickly and was explained my options for dessert. I ended up getting the seasonal special and my friend got the rain drop dessert. It was delicious, not too sweet or heavy either. They also had a peach cocktail that was to die for! Although I only came for dessert and drinks, I don't doubt their food isn't just as delicious as their dessert.
Wendy G.}Brooklyn, NY}16}29}13}-1}4}10/2/2017}I was there last week with my girlfriends after dinner for desserts and drinks. We enjoyed very much. Glad we were there early around 8:30pm. We got seated and ordered Matcha Latte, Handmade mochi (green tea, black sesame,  earl grey chocolate flavor), and Hojicha Anmitsu. Their Matcha Latte were good in both hot or cold. I highly recommend for hot drink for winter season. Matcha Latte (Deluxe: Cold matcha latte with green tea ice cream & red bean) for summer time.Sadly they ran out of Matcha Chiffon Cake. I would like to try one day.Homemade mochi (earl grey chocolate) : Earl grey isn't strong. Chocolate taste stronger (dark chocolate). I am a fan of Earl grey and its never strong. This mochi combination was okay.Hojicha Anmitsu (hoji tea (roasted green tea) jelly with sweet black syrup, shiratama mocha, and hoji tea ice cream. This combination is perfect. If you eat each item individually you will find it bland and too sweet. When mixing it, the taste is great and not too sweet.
Viviann L.}Manhattan, NY}176}756}2481}-1}4}9/27/2017}Amazing desserts and drinks although I didn't try their food. Friendly staff and speed is fine. Quite busy but usually a reservation isn't needed and the volume is quite loud. Quite authentic but also creative and modern. Nice interior but quite small. Reasonable price although closer to the pricier side but for the quality it's worth it. Great cocktails too!
Heather K.}Atlanta, GA}337}101}124}18}4}9/20/2017}Cha-An was a recommendation from a friend and when I saw the pictures, I knew that I had to visit. I came on a rainy Saturday night and it was a long wait for 8 (~45 minutes), but it was such a cute, intimate cafe that we decided we have to try it. The upside to their wait system is that they will take down your phone number and send you a text message when your table is ready. The text asked if we stilled wanted our table and gave us 10 minutes to get there. I suggest you put down your name anyways if you aren't sure! Hostess was super nice and we were able to all sit together! Servers were attentive and patient when we ordered.There are stairs that lead to a small sitting area (beware: you're most likely going to have to wait outside, it's small). I ordered a green tea parfait and a regular matcha latte ($6 I believe). As my boyfriend predicted, it tasted exactly like a regular matcha that I can make at home. On the other hand, the green tea parfait was beautiful, but at a whooping $13. There was a matcha cookie, green tea ice cream, red bean, mochi, water chestnut, green tea whipped cream, and some sort of bitter jelly at the bottom. Be sure to save ice cream and whipped cream to eat with the jelly!I loved the flavors as I haven't had anything like this and my boyfriend said it's similar to the parfaits he recently had in Japan. I would definitely come back for the experience as their dessert looks super cute! I would say that the cost is justified because it's a nicely made dessert, but... costly.
Bridgette Q.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}2}-1}5}9/20/2017}Too damn good, especially for the prices. I'm a regular here and usually come for dessert after dinner. I go for the Mochi mochi, which has the perfect sweetness level. It's far from being too sweet, but it's definitely sweet enough to hit the spot. All the teas I've tried (Okumidori, SenchaMegamicha, earl grey, lemon verbena,Ceylon Orange Pekoe) are great! It's not hard to like the tea here, so I think for the most part you can consider yourself safe with any choice of tea. If you want to dine here, make sure to arrive early because this place is usually quite busy.
Risa C.}Elmhurst, NY}2}13}4}-1}1}9/16/2017}I went to Cha-An with my sis. We waited for a while and we didn't mind. Once we got our seats and waited 10mins. A waitress came and took out menu away. Other people came after us and they got their order and water. We were sitting there with no water or server to ask us if we ordered. I never had this bad experience before in Cha-An.
RT Z.}Manhattan, NY}83}214}0}-1}4}9/10/2017}Minimun $15 for 2 people. The toilet is amazing and you have to try!Okay food... I came here for their creme brûlée - sesame flavor!!! Amazing. A very nice and cute place too. Good for dates.
Arthur D.}New York, NY}18}30}0}-1}5}9/10/2017}11/10 desserts. Beautiful, delicious, interesting. When I was there the staff were surprisingly friendly and found us a table ASAP despite the crowd. Definitely one of the top few dessert places in NY IMO.
Alyssa W.}Boston, MA}400}154}606}18}5}9/10/2017}If you want real flavors, come here. I've tried the tuna tataki over 7 grain rice for lunch, black sesame creme brulee and the hojicha anmitsu desserts. They are all VERY good and I would come back again and again. The tuna tataki is spiced very well and my mouth is watering thinking of those bites. The 7 grain rice is weird, but it grew on me and it's probably very good for you as well.  You know how when you order a flavored dessert and while it looks like it, it doesn't taste anything like it? That is NOT the case here at all. The black sesame creme brulee has a deep black sesame flavor, hojicha anmitsu has rich hojicha flavor and I bet it's the same way for all their desserts. They also serve most of their teas in a little pot that's enough for two average servings so you could split it or if you can drink two cups then get one for yourself! The ambiance in here is also very cozy, Japanese style with bamboo and decor.
Akira L.}Boston, MA}6}23}196}-1}4}9/9/2017}It is my second time here at Cha-An and still as satisfied as my first time. Food: this time we got hot matcha latte, hot matcha and Sakura raindrop cake. The flavor of matcha is very strong (in a good way). Hot matcha latte is my new favorite. The bitterness of matcha goes very well with the sweet and creamy milk. The Sakura raindrop cake is like a sweet jelly with brown sugar syrup. The taste is not that impressive compared to its look. Service: the server was nice and pretty attentive. Atmosphere: the fact that this place is hidden on the second floor of the building with a small stairway lead upto the restaurant makes this place charming. Once I got into the restaurant I felt like I just took a time machine back to an old time in Japan.
Suki N.}Rockville, MD}3}83}28}-1}3}9/9/2017}Tea was awesome, with lots of variety. Food not so much. Maybe more food desert and tea rather than dinner. Food is pretty much set menu and can't really choose or substitute anything.
Julia Y.}Santa Clara, CA}33}93}33}18}4}9/6/2017}I came here with friends to find a specific place for dessert and this place was great!  The servers were all super nice to us!  We tried a bunch of things and here are the highlights. If you like sesame then the sesame crème brûlée should be right up your alley, lightly sweet and nicely savory, it's got a very good blend of everything!  The mochi (3 types) was recommended by a friend, especially the Earl grey chocolate flavored one. I got the parfait, but it was a bit all over the place for me and was a bit too complicated for me to enjoy fully.  The service was great and the company was better!  I highly recommend this for hanging with friends and trying something fun and different on the menu!
Pierce H.}Brooklyn, NY}1}26}1}-1}2}9/6/2017}Portions are small and their dishes are way too over priced. The place is also pretty cramped, and I felt pretty squished in the whole time. The desserts do not even taste that great, and I've actually had the same items in different dessert spots for the fraction of the price. Im very disappointed to find out this place is just overly hyped up
Cindy T.}Milpitas, CA}146}40}54}-1}5}9/5/2017}This place is super cute. We only went for the dessert. You have to go up a narrow stairway to enter this place with traditional Japanese architecture. I think I had the best green tea ice cream ever at this place. There are so many ice cream shops offering in in the Bay Area, but Cha-An beats all of these spots. The whisked matcha affogato was delicious! The ice cream was so creamy and paired very well with the matcha and whiskey. I was still dreaming about this dessert when I left!We also got the black sesame ice cream with creme brûlée. This was also a great pairing. I usually don't like black sesame, but this was very good. Lastly we got the Yuzu sake, which was good - if you like your alcohol to not taste like alcohol, then this is the drink for you. I'd come back in a heartbeat.
Siu N.}Flushing, NY}458}294}83}-1}1}9/1/2017}I used to love coming here for tea/dessert with friends. I always knew it was a little on the pricier end, but the desserts would still be good and the tea would keep on coming. But tell me how I can't get hot water refills for my tiny ass tea pot anymore!?!? I get it, you're a business - you probably don't want people to milk the tea pot for everything it's worth. But if I'm going to be paying upwards of $13 for a pot that barely gives me two full cups, best believe I want more than just one water refill.Oh, and that matcha shaved ice special that also costs $13? It's just a giant bowl of shaved ice. Yes, it comes with matcha sauce, condensed milk, two balls of mochi, and barely a spoon of red beans...but I can get that in Flushing for $7 and it'll probably come with a heap of toppings and won't look like just a large bowl of ice.I'm done with this place.
Yulu H.}New York, NY}4}133}177}-1}5}8/25/2017}I can't express how much I love Cha An. Have been there several times and will continue to go. Best mixed rice I've ever had in NYC. Love their Matcha drinks and unagi don. Can't get bored of them at all!
Eddie W.}Manhattan, NY}28}38}21}-1}4}8/25/2017}I love it here for cup of tea and dessert  and hang out with the one you love !!! This dessert  place has good tea  too.. relax and enjoy
Linda M.}Manhattan, New York, NY}105}59}93}18}4}8/21/2017}3 days later and I still can't stop thinking about their mochi! If you're a fan of Japanese desserts, snacks, and tea, this is a must-stop place! The mochi mochi dessert came with two types of mochi (warabimochi and shiratamamochi) and were the perfect chewy texture. The matcha latte  wasn't mind-blowly but was still refreshing. For sure order the egg salad toast - a mound of cheesy egg salad on top of a thick slab of buttery, soft, japanese toast. I could easily stuff myself with two of these in one sitting they're so good. Beyond the food, the service left something to be desired - a little slow and unattentive, but I didn't really mind once the food came and I was happily chomping away.
Leah L.}New York, NY}3}6}5}-1}3}8/20/2017}I love matcha/green tea soooo much! But the desert in Cha-An is too sweet. I ask two more cup of water to finish my order!
Siying Z.}Schiphol, The Netherlands}55}9}12}-1}4}8/19/2017}I just such a crazy Mocha Fan, although it's a little bit upset that they don't serve the main course anymore after 7pm. Desert and tea only, so I ordered one toast it turned out to be really good. And the Mocha mousse cake is sooo good! Will definitely go again.
Alice Z.}Manhattan, New York, NY}448}87}222}18}4}8/15/2017}Cha-An offers a range of unique and traditional Japanese desserts, and while they are quite pricey for the quantity given, it's definitely worth giving them a try! Compared to other dessert places that offer matcha desserts in NYC, the matcha flavor in Cha-An's desserts is very strong without being overbearing, which is to my liking. We ordered the whisked matcha affogato and the matcha parfait, and both arrived very quickly. The matcha affogato came with a sweet whiskey, allowing us to adjust the sweetness to suit our preferences. The matcha parfait was the highlight of the evening, consisting of a tea jelly base topped with a scoop of vanilla/matcha ice cream, matcha whipped cream, mochi, red bean, chestnut, and a matcha biscuit. Highly recommend trying out their matcha parfait if you're in the area!
Lena C.}Denville, NJ}24}74}11}-1}1}8/14/2017}The dessert here is good.but because their service sucks, I decided to take 4 stars OFF. YES 4 STARS OFF!My friend and I came here on a Thursday evening. My phone happened to be dying and my friend saw an outlet in the restaurant. She first asked the waitress if she could charge the phone and the lady said there are no outlets. My friend found one behind a little corner and proceeded to charge. It wasn't bothering anyone.. it was literally behind a little stand. I saw a male behind the counter telling the waitress that we can't do that but she agreed we could since it literally wasn't bothering anyone.5 minutes passed by, the dude goes to the little corner and rips off the charger and brings it back to our table... I was so offended. Was it really annoying you that much? UGH. It sucks because their dessert is authentic and really scrumptious. To the japanese male worker.. if you see this, MIDDLE FINGER UP!!
Emily Y.}Camden, DE}75}1}0}-1}2}8/13/2017}My sister and I came here and waited about 35-40 minutes for the Raspberry butter toast. The decoration is fantastic but the service and lackluster, when asking about the status of our food, the response given to us was that "there must have been a miscommunication". I was super pumped to go here, but the experience overall was disappointing, especially at such prices.
Cassandra X.}Manhattan, NY}178}5}14}-1}5}8/8/2017}The Jewelry Box, which is a dessert combo served since spring 2017, is a great introduction piece for newcomers. On top of that, just order anything that includes black sesame. For sure, many people come here for traditional flavors such as matcha or vanilla. However, even if you are not a big fan of black sesame before, you have to give it a try in Cha-An and it might change your flavor preference forever.
Wendy X.}Brooklyn, NY}250}23}30}-1}4}8/1/2017}Came here for a quick bite and tea.  I really like the relaxing ambience here - we were seated in this cubed off section & it felt more private but unfortunately the waiters were not that attentive to that specific part of the store.  We had to wait a while until the hostess came to take our order but it was also pretty busy so it was understandable.The eel bowls with multigrain rice was so satisfying.  It also comes with thinly sliced pickled radish on the side so when you get sick of the eel taste just take a bite & your taste buds are once again stimulated by the heavenly taste of the eel.  I also got the matcha tea - it was very strong and full of flavor.  I don't recommend drinking this after 3PM because I was full of energy afterwards. They also have a good selection of desserts.  We got the black sesame creme brulee to share to end this delicious dining experience.
Secil A.}Manhattan, NY}300}138}199}18}5}7/31/2017}I am addicted to this place. It is that good! I love their homemade Mochi a lot, especially earl grey chocolate and green tea flavors. I also tried their matcha shaved ice that was very tasty and light. Also got their green tea ice cream and it was one of the best I've had. Highly highly reconciled! One of my favorite places in the city :)
Sammy B.}New York, NY}2}26}0}-1}2}7/26/2017}The desserts here are authentic and delicious. Unfortunately like most Japanese places in this area the service is no longer the subtle and calming style you would expect from a Japanese tea house. The essence of a tea ceremony, (harmony, respect, purity and tranquility) are nowhere to be found here. As long as you don't mind being treated like you are boarding a plane at Hangzhou airport then you will be able to enjoy the wonderful desserts here.
Julia G.}Houston, TX}72}23}593}-1}4}7/24/2017}A cute little place to have tea and desserts. They have many varieties of unique tea and the flower tea that we got was definitely very good. The bento dessert was very good as you can try different varieties. The sakura pearl drop is my favorite followed by the mochi assortment. The mochi is very soft and the dough part is not so thick. Just the perfect ratio between dough and filling. The matcha sponge cake is also very good. Overall, nothing at cha-an is very sweet so it is quite light and doesn't give you a gross feeling afterwards.
Amber Z.}Long Island City, NY}100}6}9}-1}4}7/18/2017}This is one of my favorite spots to drink Matche green tea and eat tasty Japanese desserts. Love this place so much!!
Tiffany L.}Queens, NY}253}165}50}18}2}7/17/2017}I'd been wanting to try Cha-An for a while now, but unfortunately all these years of anticipation led to disappointment. They used to have dessert sets but when I went, they had gotten rid of the sets. I got the Mochi Mochi, which is a scoop of hojicha ice cream topped with different types of mochi. The hojicha ice cream was indistinguishable from regular matcha ice cream, and the warabi mochi was not as soft as the warabi mochi that I've had previously.The service was also lackluster. It took forever for me and my friend to get our desserts. I'm pretty sure the people sitting next to us who arrived after us got their desserts before we did. My friend and I didn't get our desserts at the same time; I got mine first, and I couldn't really wait for her to get hers since my ice cream would have melted.
Jayvion C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}1}10}0}-1}2}7/17/2017}They told us to wait 15 min. But we actually waited 45 minutes to get our table. Not family friendly at all. Better not come to this place if you are traveling with kids. Food here is just OK.
Lucia G.}New Haven, CT}3}62}290}-1}4}7/15/2017}have tried the green tea parfait today in this small japanese tea house. It is pretty nice, but too sweet even to my sweet teeth! Next time I would try motcha latte--I believe the simple one would be of better taste!
Tiffany K.}Torrance, CA}502}491}2156}18}4}7/13/2017}small cute tea house in NY! my friend wanted to try this place out and it was really hot so we wanted some nice refreshing tea to cool us off. The front of the store is very easy to miss as it was just a brown door, but i'm sure there'll be people waiting in front. Just go in and go upstairs and put your name down. There is literally no space inside for you to wait since the halls are really narrow. We waited about 15 minutes for a party of 3. We got the summer wind and jasmine breeze special cocktails that were really good. Super refreshing and just tastes like juice. The summer wind had frozen jelly or something inside as ice which was a nice touch. We also got this mochi, green tea ice cream thing that was really good too. the mochi was SO good. so soft and not too sweet. it was perfect. Summer wind is def more flavorful/sweet than jasmine breeze. jasmine breeze is very light. it kind of reminds of the sobe green tea flavor (if you've ever tried it). but id def recommend getting the mochi! service is great. employees were friendly and checked up on us. overall very clean and nice, just the place itself is tiny.
Sara Y.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}41}0}-1}4}7/9/2017}Probably my favorite tea spot in town! The place is pretty authentic with a nice Japanese ambiance. Their food is also good: tuna tataki is always on point. I usually come for afternoon tea / dessert. Teas are always delicious and prepared with care. For the desserts, it depends on your taste, some are a bit less tasty/ more bland BUT their Black Sesame Crème Brulée is great and their little biscuits are just what you need if you want a little bite without overdoing the sugar. Bonus: they have amazingly clean bathrooms with the legit TOTO toilets (button wash controls!). I definitely recommend this place.
Lilly T.}Brooklyn, NY}9}138}82}18}4}7/3/2017}Very cute spot with a nice ambience but not exactly quiet. I'd say it's a good date spot. There's also not many tea shops that I'm aware of NYC so this is a plus for me. The desserts are cute and tasty. We got the sampler box which says it's limited in quantity. This mostly had cookies and included the Sakura raindrop cake that I wanted to try along with the black sesame creme Brulee. There is a good tea variety, mostly Chinese teas based on what I read from the menu. The service is also good.
Han C.}Fresh Meadows, NY}137}19}62}-1}4}6/30/2017}Good quality Japanese dessert place. Staffs were nice and the interior design made me feel like I am in Japan. (Jasmine Ice Tea) was really savory. I've never tried a tea that was as flavorful as this place. The moment you put your face near the tea, your nose and mouth will be filled with the  Jasmine flavor.(Ice Green Tea Latte) deluxe came with red bean paste and ice cream. Good Matcha but latte was a bit too sweet, when the red bean paste and ice cream were already in there.(Seasonal Sakura parfait) came with lots of toppings. They all matched perfectly. Each ingredients were full of unique flavors yet harmonious.(Black sesame cream Brulee) was delightful. Deep sesame flavor with pudding and ice cream. Just loved how it tasted. If you like black sesame, must try it.Overall, the desserts were really nice. The price may seem a bit too much but they are all worth the price.
Yuan T.}Baltimore, MD}55}10}5}-1}3}6/29/2017}The new dessert box made me feel not quite good. I like the old version of dessert samples. The food was ok, but my friends and I came here for tea and dessert time, I'm little disappoint by the last experience.
Annie M.}Manhattan, New York, NY}4}73}392}18}5}6/21/2017}Their savory dishes are kind of big so be sure to come on an empty stomach.Great desserts-I remember ordering something with the black sesame.Good selection of teas if you're into that.Great ambiance and just so overall cute!
Esther A.}Boston, MA}28}12}0}-1}3}6/19/2017}It's a good place for some gossip time with your girls, date, or just chill for a bit to get away from the rain. Definitely not a place for a large group.They have a large selection of overpriced tea (green tea, black tea, etc - a bit more than is listed on their website) and dessert. I got the black sesame brûlée and green tea (I forget the name but it had a note of apple). Both were pretty good, but the portions were small. I think the parfaits have decent size, but the black sesame brûlée was on the smaller side. They serve green tea in a small teapot that serves about two small cups. The teapot actually doesn't have anything in it lol - just leftover green tea powder/leaves from brewing the two cups. We thought it would have more so that was a bit disappointing.Overall, a decent place. I would come back to try new teas and desserts when I'm feeling a bit more fancy.
Matt L.}New York, NY}105}476}447}18}3}6/12/2017}Cha-An is a great setting. It's darkly lit, which in my opinion is charming, and uses a lot of wood in its design, which I'm a huge sucker for. In addition, it's got a little bit of a hidden entrance, which is cool because I'm also a fan of inconspicuous places.The selection of desserts at Cha-an however is a little bit disappointing however. For a place that allegedly focuses on Japanese style desserts, too many of the dishes use cream in their composition. In addition, nothing really stood out strongly here. I had the chiffon cake, while my friend got the mochi. Both were fine, but nothing was excellent.In the future, I think I might just come here to hang out- aka get some tea and share a dessert, since the setting is very nice and appeals to me, but I don't think I'd be visiting solely to scratch my 'dessert itch'.
Jane K.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}15}-1}4}6/10/2017}I've had this place bookmarked for a while now. Finally got to try it! The black sesame creme brûlée is definitely a winner! The matcha affogato was also good. Cute interior! I wish the bathroom had a sign that told you how to flush because there are so many buttons and the flush button is worn out... so it takes you a while to realize it says "flush." There's $6pp minimum - I wish our server told us this from the beginning instead of awkwardly coming three times to ask if we wanted anything else. We would've ordered from the beginning instead of having our conversations interrupted.
Christina C.}New York, NY}265}52}17}-1}5}6/9/2017}Such a cute spot! Tons of different types of tea, and they all come with a unique teapot and teacups. We came after dinner at Ippudo, and we got a green tea (started with a U....). It was very light and fragrant - fresh green tea! Definitely a good place for dessert, and a very cute place for a date.
Melinda L.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}4}18}25}-1}4}6/6/2017}Met up with a friend on a rainy Sunday afternoon here and couldn't be happier! You walk up the stairs and it's atmosphere is decorated, intimate and cozy that you don't want to leave. We got to sit in a semi private room that only held two tables.While they do have a regular food menu, we came with only desserts and tea in mind. Out of their endless tea and dessert options, I decided on their Chai Tea & Black Sesame Creme Brûlée. People raved about that dessert being the best that I couldn't resist. The waitress recommended the Chai Tea as a good balance to the sweetness of my dessert. Everything was so good that I wished I had the stomach to eat more. My friend ordered this green tea sundae dessert and it looked as good as it sounds.My teapot not only was cutely decorated in flowers but it held enough tea for three cups worth! That's also before the waitress came back to refill my teapot! Really couldn't be happier with finding this gem of a place in the East Village.
Dennis L.}Philadelphia, PA}336}303}143}18}5}6/4/2017}cute place. great tea. delicate desserts. awesome date place. it's not that big though, so be ready to queue if you don't get there before the rush/
Warren H.}Flushing, Queens, NY}3}21}0}-1}4}6/3/2017}Delicious Green Tea Latte, though I think $7 is quite steep.  The tea snacks are adorable and really good!  I really love the atmosphere too!
Lena W.}中環, Hong Kong}0}13}67}-1}4}5/31/2017}Cool place to go with friends to enjoy Japanese dessert. Lovely layout of each dish, the dessert is not too sweet which fits for Asian. The restaurant is not big, but you will feel like in Japan.
Brittany T.}Manhattan, NY}1267}746}1391}18}4}5/30/2017}FINALLY got to try this place!WAIT: Came on a Saturday night at 7:00 pm and got seated right away for 2 people.  I think we beat the dessert crowd because last time we came, it was quoted 45 min to an hour.  I would suggest coming on an off hour, with a smaller group or prepare yourself for a long wait.ATMOSPHERE: It's located upstairs, so don't be fooled into thinking it's the bar/club next door to it.  Once you get to the top you are greeted by a hostess.  The inside is very "Japanese" and reminded me of our time in Japan.  it's fairly dark inside, lots of bamboo and low lights and Japanese decor. It is pretty small so I could see why it fills up quickly.  There is also bar seating.FOOD: They have both lunch/dinner food, desserts and drinks.  They also have seasonal desserts so keep an eye out for that.  The desserts are a little on the pricier side ($13 for the parfait) but I guess you are paying for quality ingredients, presentation and atmosphere.  I don't think I would be back because it's hard to justify that much for 1 dessert, but I would definitely recommend coming at least once and taking out oft owners.MOCHI MOCHI - favorite out of the 2 that we got.  It has Hojicha ice cream in the middle, which is a bit more of a natural "tea" flavor almost like Jasmine or Black Tea rather than Matcha.  It has chewy square green tea jellies and round glutinous rice balls.  The glutinous rice balls are my favorite and were super good.  There is also a whipped cream/foam type thing on top of the ice cream.GREEN TEA PARFAIT - I don't know why I always get the parfaits when I never like 1/3 or so of the ingredients. I compared this to the one we had in Kyoto (Tsujiri) and it was pretty similar except the green tea ice cream was different.  This one was almost like a blend of vanilla and green tea so the flavor wasn't super prominent.  It had the glutinous rice balls, a green tea cookie, green tea mousse/cream, corn flakes, red bean and then green tea jelly at the bottom.  The jelly was pretty bitter so be sure to save some of the other sweeter items to eat with it.  The glutinous rice balls and green tea cookie were good but everything else was just OK to me.  I don't think I would get this again since, like I said, I really just like the glutinous rice balls.Overall, definitely a fun place to come for dessert and enjoy with friends or a significant other but because of the price, I don't think it's TOTALLY worth it for a second time.
Nova S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}5/27/2017}THE STAFF'S ATTITUDE IS THE WORST. I left my phone number but she took a wrong one. So I did not receive any messages. I called back, however, she told me I have to wait for another one hour. The important thing is that this is not my fault, why should I have to wait another hour? Then the staff told me it was the restaurant's policy. EXCUSE ME? No respect to the customers is the policy, this is the only way I can understand this. Can't believe it.
Lily N.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}0}20}70}-1}5}5/21/2017}Great matcha everything here! Staff was friendly and service was quick. Romantic 2nd floor secret date/dessert spot. Try the mochi! 5 stars!
Kayla W.}New York, NY}45}34}101}-1}4}5/11/2017}If you like matcha and Asian dessert, this is a place for you to spend sometime with friends. However, if you are hungry and wish to get some real food, I don't think it is the right place for you.I have been here twice on weekend, and the average wait time is about 30+ minutes. They have a tiny waiting area, so you probably will end up waiting downstairs. I have tried smoked salmon toast, green tea pudding, and Hojicha Amitsu. The salmon toast is smaller than I thought, average taste. Green tea related sweets are good.
Nashali C.}Rome, Italy}152}17}17}-1}5}5/8/2017}Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon and fell in love with its authenticity. We came in around 4 and It wasn't crowded, which I heard is a rare site. You walk in and the decor makes you feel like you walked into a tea shop in Japan. I ordered the Tuna Tataki, which is only served for lunch, and I gotta say the tuna and the seven grain rice was a great pair. The portions are small so I also ordered the miso soup, which was decent. I've had better miso soups. The waitresses were very helpful and attentive and I loved how they have a certain way they serve food and have teas paired with certain dishes that enhance the experience. For desert I had the black sesame crem brûlée, which was my favorite, and the whisked Matcha Afogato. This is one of those spots you can come on your own or with friends. I will definitely be back.
Sandy N.}Glastonbury, CT}1}15}3}-1}3}5/7/2017}Great ambiance and very clean. Place is a little pricey and the dessert and drinks were decent. I came here with a group of 8 people, so we were able to try several different drinks and desserts, but nothing really stood out to me. I think for me this is a one time thing and there's nothing on the menu that I will really crave for enough to return.
Judy Y.}Brooklyn, NY}18}133}7}18}4}5/7/2017}Almost perfection. I love everything tea and Japanese sweets, and this place hits the spot with their tea ice creams, mochi, and other sweet things. Minus one star mostly service-related. They won't serve hot water as-is (this is the only restaurant I've been to has ever refused to serve hot water, and I order hot water a lot because it soothes my dry allergy-prone throat). Also, they apparently forgot to call us when our 30-min wait table was available, but did seat us when we asked them to check.
F. K.}New York, NY}1}41}11}-1}5}5/7/2017}Enjoyed my visit. There were specials up for the golden week holiday in Japan. Space is a little small but still quiet enough to have a conversation. Highly recommend the Hojicha Anmitsu.
Wanfei Y.}Middle East, Baltimore, MD}1}8}30}-1}3}5/7/2017}I think the food's okay but the service has significantly gone down.  The table next to me is forced to pay a 15% tip, when they chose to pay 10%.  And my service has been very slow, inattentive and unclear (I'm not Japanese and I need explanations on what's being served and what's in a set).  Sad that this once cozy place is becoming arrogant and self-obsessed.
Buena Y.}Long Island City, New York, NY}265}36}79}-1}5}5/4/2017}Cha An has been open for awhile but I've always enjoyed coming here for an authentic Japanese dessert experience. It's the closest I can get to my time in Japan eating dessert at a tea house in Kyoto. My favorite is probably the mochi mochi just because I really like mochi in general. The mochi balls are glutinously soft and chewy. Eat it with the ice cream and it's noms in your mouth! The green tea powdered mochi is also very good. I've had the black sesame creme brûlée, also excellent and the fried crispy cracker on top has a great flavor. The panna cotta flavor changes every month but it's also really good. Not super sweet, nice and light. Tea is good, but haven't dined here for lunch yet. Service is not aggressive. They let you take your time. It tends to get busy around 8-9 after people have finished dinner and they head over for dessert but typically the wait isn't too long. Maybe 15-20 min max with a group of 2 at least.
Kabir A.}Queens, NY}19}94}117}-1}3}5/3/2017}Came here around 6 pm on a thursday. As we walked up the stairs a group was already waiting at the top. Luckily the host seated the two of us within 5 mins of an almost full house. Place's decor is nice. Dimly lit, intimate and Japanese oriented, but congested-others will hear you unless you lean on and whisper. Nonetheless a date spot. Noticed no one actually ordered any tea - mainly appetizers and dessert.  We had the green tea latte deluxe and the black sesame creme brulè. The latte was good but I had better (Starbucks makes it better lol) for half the price,so nothing special. Similarly the brulè was a disappointment as well. it was layered with a sesame crisp, on top of sesame ice cream that was on top of sesame brulè. Only enjoyed the black sesame ice cream but quickly got over it. Bite with all three layers wasn't anything worth craving.Service was good and friendly but items pricy for the taste experience.Not really worth making a trip to, but if around the area why not.
Jenny G.}Brooklyn, NY}56}340}1894}18}5}4/30/2017}We love our first experience at Cha An. Arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night waited all worth it 20 minutes. Got seated and ordered the blk sesame ice cream creme brulee. Omg I was so good.  Must order this if you ever go. There was so much flavor. My husband ordered the green tea parfait. He enjoyed it more than I did as I really didn't care for the rice crispies but the rest of the desert was really enjoyable. We both love to flavor of the green tea.  Love the plain mochi balls.  The smoke salmon toast was delish though we were having trouble cutting the toast.  It was a mess but we were able to figure it out. It is a must order. My husband ordered the Fukamushica green tea which the waitress recommended according to his request.  She explained that there is an apple like taste but we didn't get that.  It was really pungent, strong, and bitter to us. Overall we really enjoy our visit.  Very impressive decor, cute joint, great friendly service with a smile.  And serving scrumptious desert and food. Will definitely return.
Yumeng D.}Evanston, IL}1}5}1}-1}5}4/29/2017}The black sesame cream brûlée is a must-try! Probably the best black sesame dessert that I've ever had.
Ming Y.}New York, NY}26}3}0}-1}2}4/28/2017}Overly hyped establishment.  The food in general is average.  For those who ate a lot of Asian cuisine will not be amazed.  From price performance perspective, it gets 1 star.  Now to the details.  1) $10 for the premium matcha.  Concentrated green tea with ice cream and red bean.  Nothing really exciting about it.  2) $20 appetizer sampler, again typical things you get from Japanese cuisine.  But having a piece of macrel is just underwhelming. 3) $26 churaku set.  Very small portion, two of the appetizer are the same as the sampler.  Tofu miso soup is bizarre combo.  4) $20 desert sampler - cookies are bland, mochi and green tea ice cream taste like they are from grocery store.  Coconut short bread cake is just bad.... it shouldn't even be on the menu.  Only decent thing is green tea creame brulee5) $8 Jasmine tea -  averageSo after $100, I am still hungry, unfulfilled, and unimpressed.  I had great expectations for its dessert but only left that place seriously disappointed. In summary, if you frequent Asian desert and food, then avoid this place at all cost.  If you are an ignorant white person who still can't differentiate the difference between a Japanese girl and Korean girl, then this is the place for you.
Johnny A.}Brooklyn, NY}29}96}4}-1}5}4/17/2017}romance, romance, romance. the tea we drank energized our conversation and created more intimacy.
Jasmine C.}Sunnyvale, CA}3}10}0}-1}4}4/11/2017}Came here once in a while when I used to live nearby. It's a great place for Saturday afternoon desserts. I ordered their green tea, sesame ice cream - both are pretty good, not too sweet. Waiting time may be a bit long during the weekend but overall is highly recommended.
Yingshi H.}New York, NY}2}49}177}18}5}4/10/2017}I came here for Sunday afternoon teatime. The atmosphere here is nice and decent, with traditional Japanese style. It's a good place for relax with friends. My friend and I ordered a sesame ice cream and hojitcha anmitsu. The sesame ice cream is pretty special with sesame taste ice cream covering the sesame paste. The paste tastes delicious. I really love the hojitcha anmitsu. It has several kinds of deserts in it.  The mochi in it is yummy and cute, and you can have pretty much green tea taste of the green tea ice cream in it.  Nice desserts and   Nice place.
Kevin L.}Houston, TX}381}13}2}-1}5}4/9/2017}I went here late at night to get some dessert. From the name of the restaurant it's already obvious what their specialty is: tea. They advertise their matcha tea in many of their dishes. I was not able to try the food on the menu but we tried the iced matcha and some home-made mochi. I ordered the iced matcha tea deluxe with green tea ice cream, and red bean paste. I admit i dont know very much about tea. If you gave me a line-up of different types of tea i probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a lot of them. However, the instant i tasted the iced matcha i could tell this was very high end tea. It was very strong and pure tasting. I have never had any tea like it in my life. The ice cream gave that extra green tea flavor and the red bean paste added a hint of sweetness.The mochi comes in 3 flavors: sesame, chocolate, and matcha. All 3 flavors were excellent and the mochi was very chewy. None of them were particularly sweet and they all tasted very light. They went perfectly with any of their teas hot or cold.If you're looking for dessert or tea that isn't too sweet this is definitely the place to go! I will definitely be returning here next time
Anh T.}Holland, MI}142}80}53}-1}4}4/8/2017}Knowing this place for a while but I never have time to come here. Finally went here for an afternoon treat with my friend. We got the sampler, and I don't really remember what exactly on there, but I like the creme brulle a lot. However, the service is very slow. If you want something, prepare to wait for 10 minutes before you have it LOL. This place is famous for their desserts, which I think is very good. I do enjoyed the food a lot.
Erin K.}Los Angeles, CA}678}51}13}-1}5}4/6/2017}I wish I could bring this place over to LA so I can try everything on the menu!! :(Came in a group of four around 6pm, waited ~20 minutes. The waiting area is really tight, and employees come through the stairs pretty often, making us move around constantly. Oh well. It was a cute little place with nice, clean, Japanese-looking interior decor. We got the mochi combo, the black sesame creme brulee, and one of the matcha teas....I think it was called sencha something? I don't remember, but it was one of the ones the server recommended to us. The mochi combo was really good! I really liked the matcha chocolate one, which surprised me because I don't like chocolate flavored things. I feel like if I were hungry, I could literally eat twenty of those mochi balls. The mochi itself was really soft and chewy. Highly recommend! The black sesame creme brulee was alright. It comes with black sesame ice cream and a black sesame wafer. I think my favorite part of it was probably the ice cream. I'd get it by itself if I could. The tea was good! I don't have much to say about it haha.There were a lot of other teas and desserts we wanted to try. This is definitely a great place to chill and talk with friends over some tea and a snack. Since we were visiting New York, we were constantly moving and eating, but we came here because we wanted to sit for a while and rest while eating something yummy. Cha'an was perfect for that!! I would come back here again.
Sophia S.}Manhattan, NY}0}25}0}-1}5}4/5/2017}This is a cozy cool place where you can get good tea desserts and dishes. We had desserts, and both of them were very good. The combinations are simple but with mix texture for both desserts. With a pot of tea, it could be a wonderful tea break in the afternoon.
Kitty S.}Omaha, NE}2}30}0}-1}5}4/4/2017}We went for desert.  Moche and sesame ice cream.  Food is served with care.  Will def go back.
Xinyu L.}New York, NY}99}145}647}18}5}4/2/2017}The desserts here are amazing! They are very dedicate and not too sweet. The average wait on a weekend afternoon is about 20-30 minutes.The sesame ice cream is great! The crispy chip on the top, the ice cream in the middle, and the pastry on the bottom are based in sesame! The hojicha anmitsu is another must have desserts. It contains two small scoops of mocha ice cream, jelly, chestnut, and plain mochi ball.
Chao X.}Manhattan, NY}71}148}707}18}4}4/1/2017}Occasion: Afternoon tea with friendHighly recommend: Grilled Salmon ToastGreen tea parfaittea selectionsWarning:Portion is not big here!This is a cute, compact Japanese tea house that also serves good food! The place is tiny and can feel very crowed. But everything is managed orderly in a Japanese way!Grilled Salmon Toast:The bread was toasted so well - crunchy flaky on the outside, and buttery and soft inside. And the sauce they drizzled on was just too good! All of this is topped with a piece of perfectly grilled Salmon that melts in your mouth!Green Tea Parfait:If you've been to Japan/Kyoto and tried Saryo Tsujiri (famous for their Macha Parfait), this comes very close to that!  The green tea parfait is not as fancily decorated as Saryo but the macha ice cream is outstanding! A must try to me!Tea Selection:Being a Japanese tea house, Cha-An prides itself in having an extensive carefully selected tea menu!Tieguanyin is aromatic, clear tea with a nice aftertaste. It also comes with a really nice tea set which enhances the experience of enjoying the tea!
Claire W.}San Francisco, CA}486}182}1464}18}5}3/31/2017}A+++++++ for the desserts. We got there 10 min before last calls so can't say we experienced the full Cha-An dining experience. But god, can they make a mean Black Sesame Creme Brûlée. It's so rich and creamy; just perfection. The matcha was also not sweet and the right amount of bitterness for me personally. Combine that with the sweet red bean paste, and you're a goner. Next time...food!
Nick M.}New York, NY}163}9}3}-1}4}3/31/2017}An excellent Japanese Tea House. Located in between Gramercy and Union Square this tea house is easily accessible for a warm cup of tea or a well crafted dessert.Their tea selection is vast and unique and their desserts are all extremely esthetically interesting!Highly recommended the Flower-Craft Tea and the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée!
A M.}New York, NY}0}19}112}-1}3}3/29/2017}It is Japanese cafe. Inside of cafe looks like just Japan. Almost all customers are Asian people. But most of all are Chinese and Korean. It is so crowded and noisy...  So I could not stay long and a relaxing atmosphere.I ate lunch menu. Taste of good!! But it is expensive. I guess it is better if it is cheaper.There are a lot of sweet menu. Although I didn't eat sweet, it looks yummy. I recommend going to cafe time.
Anna N.}King, Canada}78}37}28}-1}4}3/28/2017}Unique desserts and delicious teas. I had the black sesame creme brulee and the seasonal flan. The creme brulee was amazing, however can skip on the flan. The blooming flower tea was very aromatic and also a beautiful sight.
Kristel O.}Costa Mesa, CA}96}9}6}-1}3}3/27/2017}Got the unagi lunch bowl. Pretty tasty sweet. Gen wai tea was soothing. The dessert sampler was a little pricey for what you get. The mochi was yummy homemade tasted like flowers. It came with plain brownies not a typical japanese dessert i expected. The black sesame creme brulee was ok. Overall ok. Cute little place.
Hannah V.}Flushing, NY}185}185}486}18}3}3/26/2017}Not really a big fan of Cha An but this is still a nice place. Located on the 2nd floor near St.Marks Pl, it is surprisingly quiet and serene. My friend and I came here on a sunny weekday afternoon and there were only a few peopleMost people came here for the dessert even tho they do have food as well. We went for the Dessert Sampler Plate and the Hojicha bowl. The sample includes a sakura mochi, a brownie with cranberry sauce I guess, vanilla ice cream with crispy rice cake, sesame ice cream, and some matcha cookies. To be honest, none of those was really delicious, just sweet and that's it. The hojicha bowl was pretty tasty with very light green tea jelly, matcha ice cream and mochi and some random treats. Overall it's a bit pricey compared to a regular dessert place. Service was okay. I guess the nice quiet atmosphere is the biggest plus to me.
David K.}Manhattan, NY}61}98}107}-1}4}3/26/2017}This place is pretty legit. I definitely recommend this place. The wait is a bit long but definitely worth a stop. Friendly servers and nice tea and desserts.
Vincent T.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}330}275}242}18}3}3/26/2017}Cha An is another decent place to have something sweet. The decor here is nice and you get to escape the bustling busy streets outside. Its like an old japanese home and its very inviting. My friends and I came on a thursday night. We were seated right away. The service was good and quick. We ordered the green tea parfait, ice cream sandwich, and the hojicha bowl. The desserts were all okay. Nothing really outstanding or extremely delicious. The green tea and roasted green tea ice creams had great flavor but thats about all that i really enjoyed. The sandwich part of the ice cream sandwich was just green tea rice crispy treats. The parfait itself was more matcha cream and rice puff cereal than ice cream. Cha An is something to try but not something I would come back for.
P L.}Brooklyn, NY}2}194}172}-1}4}3/25/2017}Arrived just before 8pm on a Friday night with a party of 4 and we had to wait about 30 mins to get a seat.  When we were leaving, there was a line out the door.We came for dessert and ordered a medley of items - seasonal panna cotta, seasonal parfait, ice cream duo (hojicha, black sesame) and the mochi mochi.  All dishes were really refined in presentation, taste, and quality.  A very excellent dessert.  Price point feels a pinch high, but it is a really good dessert with really great staff.  There's little room to wait inside and a line for food is often a deterrent for us, but would comeback again!
T K.}Queens, NY}0}2}2}-1}5}3/24/2017}Got the Hazelnut Parfait and ice cream Combo. The parfait was delicious and I really enjoyed the black sesame ice cream. Service was great too. Gonna go back for sure.
Sam V.}New York, NY}80}145}352}-1}5}3/16/2017}Bro recommended this place. I love tea, adore desserts, and just constantly crave a beautiful ambiance. This was and is perfect. Great date spot :D
Karen C.}Brooklyn, NY}8}36}106}-1}4}3/14/2017}We went the on the Saturday noon, the waiting time was ok. The environment is nice. We order the chef's special, homemade mochi, and the hot Japanese Green Tea.  I like the most is the hot Japanese Green Tea.  But desserts are not good as what I expected.  All staffs are very nice, which is a plus.  That's why I give four stars. P
Ken W.}San Francisco, CA}356}50}1}-1}3}3/13/2017}The place is good but does not live up to its hype in my opinion....
Catherine K.}New York, NY}157}86}241}18}4}3/12/2017}Not a big fan of tea, but this is a cool place to visit fosho!I had the black sesame creme brûlée with iced match latte. Both were pretty amazing. Because I don't really like sesame, I was debating between this menu and the roll cake, but it was a great choice. It tastes very unique and I've never tried such a dessert before! I also really liked how clean their bathroom is and the service was decent as well. I felt like I was in Asia while having dessert in this place.Because Cha An is pretty popular, you may have to wait for a bit. I had to wait for about 20 minutes but it was worth waiting.
Vera L.}San Francisco, CA}261}207}326}18}4}3/12/2017}I came here after church just to get some down time for myself.  Some people don't like to dine by themselves, but I've actually found pleasure in it from time to time.  Cha-An was always on my bucket list to check out after passing by this place several times when walking around St. Marks and especially after grocery shopping at Sunrise.  Known for their teas and desserts, I was hoping that they would have a bento lunch option available and they did!Chakura Set: -Today's Soup -Tofu and Seaweed Salad -Three Daily Side Dishes -Seven-grain Rice -Today's Special Dessert (it was matcha pudding)You can add a tea selection for an additional $5 which I of course did.I really liked the bento.  It doesn't seem like that much, but it was actually quite filling.  There was a nice balance between vegetarian and meat as well as what I would say is "heavy" with the potato salad and then the "light" side dishes like the tofu.  One of the other side dishes is smoked salmon on arugula with a light dijon mustard on top.  This was a first for me as I normally do not like nor have I had mustard with smoked salmon.  However, it went really well with each other.  Everything was freshly made as I sat at the bar and looked right into the kitchen.  Their tea selection in pretty diverse, and you can see all the teas being prepared.I definitely want to come back for more desserts: the matcha pudding was on point - I could eat a tub of that in one sitting.  I also saw that they had an eel donburi bowl which looked amazing.  Being an avid tea lover, I am looking forward to more meals and teas here.
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}3/10/2017}A pleasant Japanese place for tea, desserts, light meal, or an easy drink. Conveniently located in most popular street in east village, this spot is one of my go-to place just like Hi-Collar (coffee/bar), Sake Bar Decibel, and chikalicious dessert bar in the hood.Highly recommend to get the hand craft tea (free water refills), salmon toast (meat and chrunchy toast!) , meal set (very healthy), ice cream parfait, and Sakura panna cotta (very very nice delicate and creamy texture with aromatic roasted sesame on top). Overall, always a nice spot to check out.
Wen H.}Queens, Queens, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}3/9/2017}A nice place for you to get peace. People are friendly and food is great and looks gorgeous. Must try deserts!
Jeff Z.}New York, NY}124}18}11}-1}4}3/7/2017}This is a charming Japanese tea house in EV. I've been here a few times and it's a nice place for catching up or a date. It's not loud or overly packed.The food selection is not very extensive unfortunately, but we got one of their meal sets and salmon toast. They were good but the real reason to come here is for the matcha drinks and desserts. For us match lovers, the matcha latte is really quite delicious. I got a seasonal special chestnut parfait that was perfect. Overall, a nice place for grabbing a snack or dessert
Andy Y.}Pearland, TX}80}24}12}-1}4}3/5/2017}One of many great dessert options in the area. Do note that despite their popularity the actual tea shop is quite small, with a super narrow staircase, so be prepared for a long wait if you're coming with a large party. That said, tea & dessert is always a nice combination, esp when it's done right as it is here
Cindy L.}New York, NY}97}18}151}-1}5}3/3/2017}This is probably one of my favorite dessert spots in Manhattan. We usually order a pot of tea (that they will refill a couple of times) to go with desserts. The desserts here are delicate, delicious, and not that sweet, which didn't bother me since I find desserts at places like Spot Dessert Bar too sweet for me anyway. I went on a Friday night and had to wait around 40 minutes to get seated.
Monica W.}Brooklyn, NY}62}88}183}-1}4}2/24/2017}While looking across from Soba-ya, Cha-An was recommended by a very close friend of mine, Carmen. My friend, Andy and I both headed up the narrow staircase and he nearly bumped his head a few times. Sometimes being tallisn't necessarily a good thing. However, we noticed it was quite full of guests mostly Mandarin Chinese speakers and occasional Koreans. The waiting time didn't take much time around the afternoon, but soon it became packed soon after we were seated. Our waitress guided us gently to our table and we were given two menus, one for tea/alcohol and the other for their desserts/lunch specials. Majority of their food menu were given helpful pictures, but their desserts were quite limited. Although I must admit some of their desserts looked mouth watering and interesting. Their homemade mochi were probably the most intriguing as Andy ordered those, but I opted safe for my to go to green tea parfait (2 scoops of green tea on top of 3 mochi balls that sat besides a dollop of sweetened red beans that layered on top of a hefty amount of rice krispies that gave us texture and crunch). I also liked the descriptions for their tea list as their White Peony was very accurate - melon / floral / sweet. Andy ordered an oolong, but somehow his was in a teeny tiny cuppy cup which was very cute, I'm assuming it was because oolong is generally very strong and pouring it was very interesting. Our waiter seemed to be a bit nervous as it was very busy and he seemed to be under the stress of going all over the place to collect dishes and maintain calm/collected. The most interesting and frequent item on the menu I look up to for is the appetizer sampler because it's something of each in tiny portions to know what's good and what's not to your palate. I found the salted fried mackerel and the smoked salmon pretty decent. Although their lunch item for the tuna bowls are very limited and served till 6pm, they're so-so on being filling. I'd love to come here again to try out more teas and next time maybe I'll opt for the dessert sampler. My stomach can only go so far before buttons pop and before my belly jiggles.
Anita V.}Manhattan, NY}20}91}42}18}5}2/22/2017}Goodness gracious this place was amazing. A friend and I visited here for tea and dessert to have our monthly date and it was such a great experience. The tea selection is outstanding (and plentiful) and so artfully executed.  I enjoyed just decided which tea to get. They also have sake and other alcoholic drinks but if you're coming here, it would be a miss not to get tea. The desserts are 5 stars on their own.  We got the black sugar creme brûlée and green tea parfait. I loved these desserts because they weren't overly sweet and so they pair perfectly with the tea and again, the artistry+taste is great. Be prepared to wait though, we waited around 15-20 minutes for table for 2, granted it was a Saturday night.  The wait staff was accommodating (I spilled a cup of water all over the table and they had nothing but smiles for me and paper towels!) and great with showing us how to drink the tea since some have specific processes. All in all, I will definitely be going back!!!!
T C.}New York, NY}0}48}5}-1}4}2/18/2017}Like stepping into Tokyo. Tea selection is smaller than expected but this place is fantastic. The bites are authentic and great for a little snack.
Kat W.}Brooklyn, NY}1}32}62}-1}4}2/18/2017}Nice place to hangout with friends. I love all kinds of food that made with matcha, and I heard about this place for a while. Finally had a chance to go there on Thursday night. It wasn't crowdy on a weekday night, staffs are friendly. -For the food, I wanted to try the eel but they only have that for lunch special. So me and my BF ended up getting their dinner set. The food wasn't the best JP food I've ever had but it's fine. -For the dessert part, we ordered two parfaits, one seasonal, one mocha. Both flavors are good but I like mocha one better. But we didn't know (cus not really pay attention on the menu) the dinner set also comes with dessert, so we ended up getting two for each of us. Will definitely go back and try their eel lunch special and other  desserts.
Tom C.}Manhattan, NY}57}28}26}-1}3}2/18/2017}Was always curious about this place and stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Food was pretty good, but it was just a lot noisier than I thought it would be and a little pricier. We didn't get any, but then desserts looked great.
Echo W.}Hopewell Junction, NY}27}311}106}-1}5}2/10/2017}Lovely dessert place. I really enjoyed the seasonal parfait. The mochi has wonderful texture that keep you thinking about it long after.
Vanessa C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}10}16}-1}5}2/8/2017}Delicious Japanese desserts!!! Randomly found this place on Yelp when I was looking up another restaurant in the area. Read about the many good reviews and decided to pay it a visit. My hubs and I ordered two desserts - sesame creme brûlée and hojicha jello! They both were soOOOo good! Both very flavorful yet not overwhelmingly sweet like typical Japanese desserts. Cha-An has quite an extensive dessert menu, I can't wait to come back again to try other items.
Tung D.}New York, NY}337}302}523}18}4}2/5/2017}This place is great! I had been trying to find a good non-bar place to sit down with friends and have tea & desserts leisurely, and this place fit the bill.We a group of 4 came in and there was no wait at all (even though there were some people standing at the stairs for some reason).They had a good selection of unique desserts like the sesame brulee, or the whisked matcha affogato, and good varieties of parfaits.I ordered the match affogato while my friends ordered mochi, panna cotta, and other dishes. We also could share a set of tea among 2 people, so a friend and I shared the genmaicha.Even though the desserts looked fancy, the taste didn't seem to be there. My affogato was just so-so. The matcha flavor just wasn't there. The hot tea was nice for the hot weather, though.Anyway, still 4 stars for the nice experience. Will be back to try different desserts such as the parfaits.
Helen Z.}Acton, MA}0}46}0}-1}3}2/5/2017}3.5 stars-This review is only for the dessert sampler and tea. I got a brick of pu-erh tea and thought this was worth it in terms of strength and flavor, and the servers were quick to refill our hot water. The dessert sampler in my opinion was not worth the $20. I only really enjoyed maybe 2 out of the 5 desserts, the servings were tiny even for a sampler, and we were looking around at other people's full size desserts that were way bigger and looked more satisfying. I would have liked to be able to have more of a choice of which desserts were in my sampler or have it be a little less expensive to warrant the cost.I liked the ambience of the place and would come again to try their lunch sets and full size desserts.
Jamie N.}Manhattan, NY}4}20}14}-1}3}2/1/2017}As usual I decided to come here after work as a treat for myself. As i walked up the stairs there stood a western looking man who lead me to the corner of the bar (it was only 6pm, the whole place was empty). By then i already felt things were different. Then came the menus. Still serving same food but the menus are new. The staff were all new faces too. They feel much less attentive & sensitive. Then finally came the food. I ordered the usuals. Matcha & set B. The matcha tastes less richThe preparation is a lot less refined. The tea rice didnt taste of tea at all. The fish is probably the worse i have ever had here. It was never bad. But this time it was very very average. Dry in texture and very oily skin. The vegetable is bland. All in all i feel very disappointed and am convinced that the management might have changed. The old Cha an will be missed dearly. I love this place but i dont think i will be coming here again. Paying the same price and getting less quality is not what i want.With tip it came down to 44$. I certainly do not feel like i ate 44$.
Danielle P.}New York, NY}192}34}8}-1}5}1/28/2017}I love love LOVE cha-an! The lunch and dinner sets are delicious and their side dishes change every day! The 7 grain rice they use is so tasty! Service here is really great, they will refill your teapot a few times so you get the most out of the tea leaves. The hojicha is my favorite tea offering that I've tried there so far, but no matter which you choose you really cannot go wrong.The salmon toast is really delicious as well, the toast is a bit sweet and soft and the salmon is cooked perfectly. The desserts are all mild in their sweetness which I enjoy, because sometimes less is more. The parfait, sesame creme brulee, and flans are really good, but I think the best dessert they offer is the Raspberry Chocolate souffle. It is AMAZING!! I get this every time I go without fail. The only upsetting experience I EVER had here was the last time I went, the 'dessert of the day' (which comes with the full meal set) was what tasted like frozen brownie bits with strawberries. I expected more from them, even though I know the 'set meal' dessert is always a small dish, in the past with that set I've gotten green tea flan. Even a small scoop of ice cream would have been better than that!
Laura C.}Cambridge, MA}446}98}139}18}4}1/26/2017}Came a while ago with friends and had an AMAZING time! The food is INCREDIBLE, but service was a bit slow. I think it's really tough to find delicious Japanese food in New York that is exorbitantly expensive-- I'd definitely come back sometime! I'd note that the food and portions are a bit lighter than what Americans may be used to, so in that regard it may seem a bit pricey for the portion size, but I think the flavor makes up for it!I forgot to post this review, oops, but here you go-- 6 Sample Appetizer ($13-- now $15)Everything was fresh, unique, and authentic. Portions a bit small, even for a sampler, but taste was A+++. I wish I knew what everything was called, though! Lunch Specials! Unagi Kabayaki and Tuna Tataki ($13/ea-- now $15/ea)Each bowl came with mixed rice, really fresh veggies (side dish), some pickled veggies, and tea!Dessert Sampler ($20)SO good! There were five desserts-- I also wish I knew what they were called! In describing them, there was a small matcha cake of sorts, a matcha creampuff/macaroon hybrid, black sesame ice-cream with a waffle chip, creme brulee-esque custard with raspberry, and a sakura mochi.Matcha Latte ($7-- now $7.5)Deemed very delicious and authentic (not overly sweet, which I love) but a bit pricey!
Ross P.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}5}1/22/2017}Was told wait time was 20-25 min. Was seated in 15 min. I had earl grey tea and my friend had a regular black tea. They have about 20+ different teas. Both were perfect; delicious, comforting, and warming to your soul. The decor and ambiance is really low key and nice but the talking level/volume was a little high. It took away from the chill vibe the place was designed for. This was a Saturday night at around 10 so it is probably more relaxing on a weekday night. Had some mochi dessert which was really good. Great place for tea and a change from your typical desserts.
Ash Rahman D.}New York, NY}103}28}2}-1}4}1/21/2017}Love this place! The vibe was good! The mochi was ahhhmazing and so was the chocolate soufflé!  This place is the perfect for a date and their array of desserts should probably fit everyones pallet! But real talk though! Their chocolate soufflé was lit! But don't get the ice cream sandwich! Extremely hard to eat because the rice crisps wont break at all! We literally had to use our hands to eat it after eating away all the ice cream but other than that this place is amazing! Would definitely go again!
Yue L.}Northfield, MN}88}116}36}-1}5}1/21/2017}One of the best matcha place around NYU. I really like the unagi rice bowl and the matcha pudding. Will come back and try other desserts!
Audie W.}Jersey City, NJ}61}5}0}-1}5}1/14/2017}This is a great place to have mocha desserts!I ordered Hojicha Anmitsu, Mochi Mochi.They are both awesome!!!!Also the hot mocha latte is terrific!Love this place. The best mocha desserts ever!!
Cordelia Z.}Wellesley, MA}250}9}0}-1}5}1/13/2017}Came to this tea shop to catch up with a friend and it was awesome! We were seated in the little room off the main dining area and split a dessert sampler between the two of us. I don't remember exactly what we got but the black sesame creme brulee was so delicious! We also had some sort of brownie chocolate item that was really good. Overall, a great place to just sit and chat with friends. It felt really peaceful but we never felt like we had to dial down our volume.
Charlie L.}Manhattan, NY}209}148}351}18}3}1/11/2017}Great little date spot for a light meal, tea and dessert. The restaurant is located one block north of St Marks on the second floor. Very nice and posh dining area with great ambiance - hence a great spot for a date. With that said, I am not a big fan. If you are coming here for tea and dessert - sure I can see it being a hit - but it is pricey! A cup of tea will set you back ~$10 and another $8-12ish for dessert. I came here for dinner and there was only to meal set choices, the ChaKura, which is has shrimp as the main bowl or Kayu, which tuna or eel as the main bowl.I got the Chakura and it was okay...the main bowl is like a shrimp salad, with very light mayo dressing, rice, soup, tofu/mushroom and salad. It was good, but did not leave me full or craving for more.We also order the Seasonal Parfait and Mochi Mochi as desserts and the parfait was definitely better than the mochi mocha. Again, nothing to go crazy over. Our bill came out to $72, which I thought was expensive for what we ordered. Décor and ambiance is a plus! Food is a meh. Service is a yay!By the way, I am not sure how this place is only "$$", should be "$$$".
Youjia H.}State College, PA}147}3}1}-1}1}1/11/2017}The two reception clerks are so mean. We have five people but only three showed up, there's a four people table, we are willing to squeeze when the other two arrived, but they don't allow us three to sit down first but have us waited for more than an hour. If they were our servers, I would definitely give a negative tip for the ridiculous rules.
Weiyue D.}Madison, WI}9}10}33}-1}3}1/10/2017}I ordered the Seaweed Salad and Daily Soup (Miso Soup) with the famous Black Sesame Créme Burlee. Seaweed Salad ($9): contains lesser seaweed than expected. Tofu (3 pieces) was very silky and slightly firm but could do with more pieces. The dressing has a slight wasabi aftertaste which is pretty interesting. Miso Soup ($7): pretty average, serving big enough to be shared by 2-3 peopleBlack Sesame Créme Burlee ($9.50): that was totally the highlight of the meal. Came with a thin crunchy black sesame cookie on top of a scoop of black sesame ice cream. Below it was créme Burlee with black sesame custard. It was literally perfect. A little on the sweet side but brings out the aroma of black sesame.Overall: would definitely return for its dessert but will reconsider it's mains as it can be pretty pricy.
Di L.}New York, NY}201}39}21}-1}4}1/8/2017}Good selection of sweet and traditional tea. Great variety of beautifully plated less-sweet Japanese desserts. Alright tasting but interesting looking food. Great spot for casual afternoon chats with friends or date.
Kathleen S.}Brooklyn, NY}54}210}350}18}5}1/8/2017}I stumbled upon this place while walking around the East Village on a cold Sunday morning, and boy, what a gem. This might be one of my favorite places in the entire city. With an insatiable sweet tooth and a love of novelty, I ordered the sesame creme brulee. I don't even like creme brulee usually, but this was the most amazing one I've ever had. Topped with swirled sesame ice cream, the hardened sugar was perfectly done, while the sesame custard below was full of the nutty sesame flavor. Even the crispy sesame chip adorning the top of the dessert was delightful. This was an absolute hit. I also ordered the deluxe matcha green tea latte, which came with a scoop of the green tea ice cream and some red beans. This is the MOST amazing matcha green tea ice cream I've ever had in my life. Truly flavorful in the real taste of matcha, particularly the umami characteristic, comes though beautifully. I will definitely return with an appetite for the set meals and other desserts, such as the homemade mochi.
Nessa N.}Manhattan, NY}132}213}3}-1}4}1/8/2017}Can't believe I haven't been here after living in the city for five years and coming to St Marks quite frequently. I guess I was afraid of the wait since this place is pretty popular. It wasn't too bad for us on Friday night. We decided to sit at the bar - a wait for a table for three would probably have been long.The matcha (with red bean) tasted really nice. It has a bitter green tea taste at the end but is very delicious. I was very impressed with the raspberry butter toast and the ice cream sandwich thing. The menu has very nice pictures to help those who aren't familiar with the terms. The desserts are delicious. And it seems like Cha-An takes it to the next level with elegant, scrumptious presentations.
Ben L.}Queens, NY}943}947}2632}18}4}1/5/2017}I visited once years ago, and I only tried their desserts. The other day I came by to try their lunch and to be honest, I was really happy with their lunch set. I thought the meal was well crafted, tasted very light and felt healthy. I would definitely go back to try their other lunch items as well.The food:Unagi Kabayaki- Sliced grilled eel with shredded egg omelette. I visited on a Friday and I think the items differ per day, but on the Friday I went, I asked the waitress on a recommendation and she said she enjoyed the eel, it was an awesome recommendation! I really enjoyed the flavor of the eel which was not too sweet and I really loved the texture of their seven-grain rice. But the one flavor that really took it over the top for me was their shisho leaf, it added such a floral quality that really paired nicely. The lunch set was a good deal and I thought the Genmai Tea, that was included, was nice and comforting. I did buy the $3 mini dessert but I think that was totally skippable, it was such a small bite and I wasn't crazy about the flavor, it was kinda like a mini brownie with almond. yelp.com/user_local_phot…
Mich M.}Manhattan, NY}15}75}527}18}4}12/31/2016}I don't have much to say about this place. I didn't try their dessert. I had a smoked salmon salad and it tastes sour, but it wasn't bad. The ambiance is pretty cool. Makes you feel like you're somewhere in Japan. The price is good. Definitely come here and check it out if you want Japanese dessert.
Angela L.}San Francisco, CA}121}4}0}-1}2}12/30/2016}Pretty overpriced place. The green tea I ordered was not brewed enough so it tasted like water when served. I asked to refill and waited for a longer time, the favor tasted better. The mocha expresso of adffogato is too light. Overall, the food and drinks are just okay definitely not worth its price.
Meredith Z.}Columbus, OH}0}61}61}-1}5}12/30/2016}Fantastic! I won't miss American desserts for quite a while.The soybean pudding was an amazing surprise!
Waner Z.}Secaucus, NJ}0}3}20}-1}3}12/23/2016}Have been waiting for almost an hour. I asked the waiter who replied that the kitchen did not receive our order. :( Great dessert but awful service.
Claire P.}Manhattan, NY}7}115}63}18}3}12/20/2016}Quality of drinks and food was superb, and in an intimate setting, but due to the sheer number of people present, really difficult to enjoy that vaulted Japanese tea parlor experience (we made our visit at 4pm on a Saturday, wait was around 40 minutes long). Our waitress came to check on us so frequently given the line that I drank my tiny matcha latte (think cocktail glass) in 5 minutes, though it cost about double that amount of time in dollars. It might be worth going on a slower day, when you can sit back and talk over tea for several hours. But given the minuscule size of the portions that suggests a 1/2-1 hour visit max, Cha-an encapsulates the depressing reality of trying to instill slow culture in a place as populated and busy as New York.
Jinny P.}New York, NY}776}146}501}18}3}12/20/2016}The ambiance of the place is great. It's got a traditional Japanese style wooden doors and tables and Eastern decorations. There's a private room in the back as well, although it's not completely closed off. And, they have some amazing looking eclectic desserts that taste great as well. I've also heard some great things about their lunch specials, which I haven't tried yet. But. I thought the tea here was overpriced. For a small pot of tea, which, as far as I can tell, didn't seem like anything crazy or special, $7-12 price range is a bit too much. Even if they were some sort of special teas, a newbie like me would have no idea what I was drinking since there were no presentations or descriptions on the menu. To me, it tasted just like any other tea I've had at regular tea or coffee shops. It's a cute, relatively quiet place to sit down with friends and catch up but it's not really a place one would go to really experience and learn about teas. Although, this place is supposed to be known for teas .. and categorized under "tea room".
Jocelyn K.}Jersey City, NJ}443}810}4544}18}4}12/16/2016}Cha-An is very well known for their dessert. When I first came on a Sunday night around 8pm, we waited about 45+ min. just to get a table. But I actually highly recommend coming here for their lunch instead. Unfortunately they are open during lunch only Fri.-Sun. starting at noon and open Mon-Thurs starting at 2pm. The second time I went on a Friday (today actually) around 1:30pm and there was no wait at all.Seasonal Parfait (assam tea jelly, chestnut ice cream and sweet potato custard topped with mochi, chestnuts, and a matcha rice crispy bar) - Good amount of texture in this parfait with the tea jelly, chestnuts, and crisped rice in the parfait itself. I was hesitant at first if I would like the parfait since I'm not a fan of creamy desserts, but I actually really liked the sweet potato custard. The sweet potato flavor really comes through and the pieces of chestnuts was a nice touch in terms of texture. The only thing I didn't like was that there was way too much whipped cream. Hojicha Anmitsu (green tea jelly with sweet black syrup, shiratama mochi, red bean, green tea ice cream) - Very small dessert, but so much tastiness packed in that small dish. My favorite part was the refreshing jelly.Unagi Kabayaki (sliced grilled eel with shredded egg omelette) - If you can come here for their lunch sets. The unagi came on top of a bowl of 7-grain rice, seaweed, pickles, and Genmai tea. The also put some shredded shiso leaf on the top which added a kick of flavor. The eel was a small but delicious piece. My favorite part was the rice though. The set is filling, but you won't feel uncomfortable at the end. The Genmai tea was very welcome after being for so long in the cold. If you run out of tea, you can as the waitress to refill the teapot with hot water.The place does take credit cards, but there is a minimum. During lunch there was only one waitress working the dining room and one stationed at the bar, so it was hard flagging someone down to take our order, give us our check, etc. I'm not sure I would come back for dessert, but I would definitely come back again for their lunch sets.
Allan B.}Haddonfield, NJ}0}4}0}-1}5}12/12/2016}This place was really great. The service was super-conscientious, the food and tea were top-notch, and the ambiance was both authentic and enjoyable. My friends and I felt serene and enjoyed it as a place to have a low-volume chat and nurse our tea over a nice bite to eat, while keeping off the cold. Definetly recommend to anyone who enjoys good tea.
Justine C.}White Plains, NY}34}104}103}-1}4}12/12/2016}Love their green tea parfait! Very cute place too, on the 1st floor but on the smaller side, you may have to wait. Service was quick and nice, matcha latte and Parfait were great. Minus 1* as they say they re open til 11pm BuT their kitchens close at 9.30pm! So no more desserts after that! (Annoying at a tea/desserts place..)
Joann L.}Brooklyn, NY}21}84}67}18}4}12/11/2016}After seeing all the images on Instagram I really wanted to try out this place. They had such cute desserts and I absolutely love my dessert. To be honest I was extremely surprised at the other types of food that was offered at this place. I though that it was mostly going to be a desert kind of place but they offer a lot of different kinds of hot foods. My friend and I ordered the toast and I got the smoked salmon toast and it was amazing. The toast was extremely fluffy and thick; the flavors went extremely well together. There were also pieces of salmon embedded into the toast which I thought was extremely creative as well. For dessert I tried the Green Tea Parfait which was really yummy, however my only compliant was that the green tea cream was extremely sweet. I also came back a second time and I got to try the Hojicha anmitsu which was nothing really special - I felt like it was just grass jelly and brown sugar sauce with some ice cream. There is also a variety of tea options here, and you get a huge pot of tea for about $6 which I think is a pretty good deal. Overall, I love the food here and I would def come back to try the other food options that are offered. Some of the desserts are really delicious and others I found are just okay and the desserts can be pretty pricey which I don't think is worth it since they are pretty small in size as well.
Sandy P.}Queens, Queens, NY}57}76}151}-1}3}12/9/2016}I came here with my sister and friend for a farewell dinner. I wasn't really sure if this was a place that would be good for dinner because people kept saying tea house so naturally I was just thinking tea and biscuits or something. But there was food. Not many options to choose from but food nonetheless.We started off with the appetizer sampler and one order of the smoked salmon. The sampler was pretty small and the portions even smaller. The seaweed was my favorite, aside from that nothing really stood out and wasn't all that great. For drinks we ordered Hoji which was very refreshing on such a cold night. It came in a small pot and it was refilled with hot water constantly. We didn't get water though. I looked around and saw other tables with water, so I guess they forgot to bring us some.For entrees they didn't really have much to choose from. It was either a set meal or toast. So we all pretty much went with the toast. I chose the egg salad. The bread was very tasty and the egg salad was just traditional egg salad.& last but not least dessert. I had a scoop of the black sesame and a scoop of the matcha ice cream. Both were yummy but the matcha had a lot of matcha clumps that gave immense bursts of bitterness in my mouth which was the only con.All in all, not a bad spot. But next time I think dessert OR a cup of tea would do. A full on meal isn't really worth it here.
Hannah L.}New York, NY}229}232}604}18}4}12/3/2016}Cute little tea house in J-Town. Requested a table for two on a Saturday night and was told it'd be a 40 minute wait, but ended up being around 20 minutes. Very much enjoyed my experience.Space - Intimate space. Perfect for a date or catching up with friends. What intrigued me most was the super clean Japanese toilets with a million buttons (and one to clean your tush). It's a wonderful experience ;)Service - Hostess was super welcoming.Flower Craft Tea - The waiter brought out a glass kettle with a closed flower on the bottom. He poured hot water over it, closed the lid, and the flower started to blossom over the next two minutes. Wonderful experience, and the mild tea was a perfect compliment to our dessert set.Dessert Sampler - Came with black sesame creme brulee (great flavor but wish the top shell was toasted a bit more for added crunch), homemade mochi with a yuzu filling (loved the surprise center flavor), green tea cookies (a little on the dry side), ice cream duo with brittle (favorite), chocolate with nuts and strawberries (too sweet for me). Beautifully delicate plating.
Rhondel W.}Tampa, FL}918}15}54}-1}4}12/3/2016}The ambience is great and the desserts are definitely unique! I would definitely suggest getting their Genmaicha, it's spectacular! The chef's selection dessert sampler is delectable and gives you the broad spectrum of dessert options.
Becky C.}Manhattan, NY}27}16}18}-1}5}11/26/2016}Amazing tea house with great food. Recommend the salmon toast and the dessert sampler! Staff is very friendly and attentive at refilling hot water for the tea. p.s. Clean + interesting Japanese style bathroom. Has a sliding door with a fancy multi function toilet.
Nina F.}Brooklyn, NY}6}3}0}-1}1}11/25/2016}I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 4pm to try their stuff since other yelpers said they were great and we were in the area the night before, so we purposely drove out to the city for this. I was told that the wait would be 20 mins, so give or take I was expecting maybe 30 mins? We waited in the little space outside the restaurant right at the staircase since it was cold outside. Next thing I know, almost an hr had past before we were seated. Maybe 30 mins into waiting, he told me that he noticed 2 tables were open and not seated. I thought at first maybe those were reserved and the waitresses were giving the parties a 5-10 min window to show up, turns out, NOPE. They were just holding the tables to make it seem like they had a lot of business to make other customers wait. When we were seated, I thought we would be getting one of those 2 empty tables after an hr's worth of waiting, but instead we were seated at a 3rd empty table. like seriously?! I noticed later on that those tables were given to other customers who were also told 20 min wait, whom left and then came back.. when they could have been seated on the first arrival. After we were seated, I noticed at least 2 waitresses looked at our table and proceeded to ignore us. After 5 mins of being seated, the hostess came up to us and asked if we were waited on and when we said no, then she took our order. If the waitresses aint gonna even bother to help us, why hire them, the owner might as well hire other ppl or save that money for something else. The only good thing from the visit was that the food and drinks came out quick. My boyfriend and I both ordered the green tea latte deluxe, which is green tea latte with green tea ice cream and red bean. I think it was $11, for that price I could've went elsewhere for a better tasting one. It tasted like straight powder green tea while the ice cream wasn't rich enough. The red bean was the best part but too bad it sinks into the drink after 1 scoop of eating it. We also ordered the green tea/red bean sponge cake and black sesame creme brulee. Honestly, I felt like a sponge cake tasted the same as those in a Chinese bakery, or maybe even worst. We had the green tea filling one first and that was alright but the sponge cake itself wasn't moist enough, kinda dry to eat. We had the red bean filling afterwards and if I was blindfolded, I wouldn't have known what flavor I was eating. Tasted bland with dry cake again. The black sesame creme brulee.. at first it tasted good, but as I kept eating it, it just wasnt good. I was really hoping this one would save the horrible day. The black sesame wasn't rich enough although the bottom of the scoop was full of sesame. I thought the best part of the whole thing was the cracker on top of the creme brulee. So pretty much I paid like $10 for 1 little cracker. The bill came out to around $50, the worst unsatisfying bill I have ever had. I didn't even want to tip them but its freaking NYC and I just didn't have the heart to not tip. Even worst? The receipt came with 18%, 21%, or other option, like seriously?! They deserved 0% for tip for such a horrible visit. I had such high hopes for the place cus other yelpers said they were so good and the pics even looked great. I am so disappointed.
Urinka H.}New York, NY}115}62}58}18}5}11/23/2016}Worth waiting on line!! Loved sampler plate, a number of selection of high quality of teas. (You an ask for more hot water) Ditch the bar after the dinner and come here instead to enjoy the intimate and cozy Japanese atmosphere. I usually bring my non-Japanese friends and all of them have been satisfied so far
J L.}Palo Alto, CA}1}87}1}-1}4}11/21/2016}Been here once, I actually don't remember what I had (some kind of ice cream dessert), but it looked really nice and tasted good. Maybe pricey for me since I have not been living in Manhattan for long, but I would still give 4 star.
Wendy C.}New York, NY}175}389}354}18}4}11/18/2016}Delicious desserts and food, but not worth the price. If this wasn't located in Manhattan I think it would be cheaper. I like their menu - it is easy to look through with pictures. The place isn't that big. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Toast and Green Tea Parfait. The bread was soft with a vinegar dressing on the salmon and greens. I liked the mochi in the Green Tea Parfait. The seasonal Chestnut parfait was good too.
Arlene H.}Belmont, CA}0}36}5}-1}5}11/14/2016}A-mazing desserts! I love this place. They don't take reservations but worth the wait. I'm not a dessert person, but this is only dessert I can eat and not fill overwhelmed by sugar.
Celeste W.}New York, NY}66}93}92}-1}5}11/12/2016}Yes for Cha-An, great dessert place! I tired their bowl dessert with green tea ice cream and red bean, absolutely superb. My boyfriend had the chocolate dessert and he was impressed by it too! Definitely recommend to everybody for a quick dessert!
Phil C.}Boston, MA}1}1}0}-1}2}11/12/2016}Horrible experience. Quoted 20 minute wait but ended up being 50 minutes. Got seated next to a couple loudly face timing someone and on the other side they let someone squeeze a third person in without asking us. It's common courtesy to ask if we're okay with having someone squeeze next to us from a different table. It's also not okay to let people FaceTime someone in such a small space. Was not helped for awhile until the hostess noticed we were just sitting there. The second we sat down, we wanted to leave. Very disappointed.
Amy Z.}New York, NY}690}229}366}18}5}11/7/2016}Their Homemade Mochi is out of this world! So fresh, moist, thin, and soft, it melts upon contact with your tongue...and may have inspired me to write food porn. The insides are just as impressive: green tea, black sesame, and earl grey chocolate. The chocolate is my favourite: luscious chocolate truffle texture, with a hint of earl grey that not only ties it back to the mochi flavor, but also echos the aroma of the teas.You can't go wrong with any of the teas - let the three adjective descriptors be your guide. We got the Yinzhen Silver Needle white tea: could not resist "almond, butter, velvet."
Ruth A.}Fort Lee, NJ}159}92}369}18}4}11/7/2016}Service was great, right when we sat down, the server brought us menus and water for each of us. Came for dessert but definitely want to try the food too next time! I got the hojicha ($7) and the earl grey panna cotta ($9). Pretty pricey for tea and dessert, but they were both delicious. I love hojicha because of its roasted taste and it was great paired with the panna cotta since it wasn't too sweet. Their bathroom is wonderful, especially for a New York City bathroom. I appreciate that bidet toilet, almost every toilet in Japan has one. Wish bathrooms in America had them!
Jay H.}New York, NY}46}162}40}18}4}11/4/2016}Came for my birthday two years ago and this place is very cozy and has traditional Japanese food and decor. I loved it and so did my friends, from bento box to dessert , everything was spot on! It's amazing and delicious. Highly recommend but def make reservations as it's a small place and very popular!
William S.}New York, NY}168}12}22}-1}4}11/2/2016}As a fan of matcha everything, this place seemed too good to be true when I initially saw it on Yelp. I had the Ice cream sandwich and the green tea parfait. Both were very solid deserts. The atmosphere of the restaurant and the taste of green tea briefly brought me back to when I was in Japan last summer. Green Tea Parfait (rice krispies on the bottom, mochi, ice cream and whipped cream)- the green tea ice cream is really good. It had a good flavor without being too heavy. However, I felt like there was way too much whipped cream and not enough ice cream. The bottom of the parfait was pretty much just rice krispies. Kinda pricey for what it was. Ice cream sandwich- I really enjoyed the green tea flavored rice krispy. It was definitely something unique that I've never had before. The ice cream in between was earl grey flavored, also very good and complemented the green tea krispies very well. I definitely like this better than the parfait. But it's so thin! Overall- the deserts are very good and unique. The portions for the deserts seemed a bit small for what you were paying (~10$+), especially compared to other places in the area such as Spot desert bar. But definitely check this place out.
Michelle L.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}98}6}47}-1}5}11/2/2016}Me and coworkers came after work and there was no wait! We ordered Fukamushicha Green Tea, Chef's Selection Dessert Sampler and Smoked Salmon Toast. The tea itself is refreshing with a natural green tea taste. Great spot for a bottle of hot tea and along with some sweets. You may also ask for refill with hot water; which is a plus because you'll be probably be out of tea after 2-3 cups or one round if your sharing with friends. My favorite piece from the chefs selection dessert is the Black Sesame Créme Brulée! I'm a tea lover! and they presented their tea very nicely us. The Japanese lady who set up our table placed our utensils very neatly and our tea cups as well. I give it 5 star for the food and the service!
Boya W.}New York, NY}5}4}7}-1}5}11/2/2016}Great atmosphere great food! One of my fav dessert bar to catch up with friends/have some sweets after a long shopping afternoon lol. Their new seasonal parfait is worth trying tho i would prefer it with less whipped cream.
Bec V.}Brooklyn, NY}34}53}30}-1}3}11/2/2016}Good place to hang out with your girlfriends to catch up.Chocolate souffle - meh, too sweet - skip it Ice cream with mochi in a cup - it was just okay - mochi balls bland, ice cream not too sweettea pot - nothing special, a regular tea bag less than $1 will do for me, but the pot cost $7
Nana B.}Bronx, NY}357}136}53}18}4}10/31/2016}This place has a really eclectic menu, with great dessert options. However, it gets pretty crowded and the wait tends to extend past 30 minutes, even at 9pm at night on a weekday. I would recommend calling ahead to reserve by phone (if they allow it) Grab a seat by the window as well
Chengzhi W.}New York, NY}87}42}64}-1}5}10/30/2016}Definitely one of my favorite dessert spots in the city. It is worth the long wait that sometimes happen on weekends and evening hours. Cha An has a wide selection of teas and several options for small entrees and desserts.If you are unsure of what dessert to get, they have a dessert sampler with, I believe, five different types of dessert that they offer. My favorite by far is their black seasame ice cream dessert. They have never disappointed me with any of their desserts. I recently went back to try their seasonal parfait. All of their desserts are well decorated, delicious, and great for the gram if you're into that.
Celia N.}Brooklyn, NY}11}106}283}18}5}10/28/2016}I was seated in a small room at a table for two with only one other table, a sort of semi private booth with a window giving me a glimpse of the noisy rest of the restaurant. My mission - traditional matcha. You don't really get what you pay for as far as quantity goes - it was measly. However the taste made it worth it this one time. Vegetal, grassy, without much bitterness to my surprise,  in this instance sweetness and sugar were not missed. The matcha was accompanied by a small teapot shaped plate of the best mochi I have had so far, and red bean paste. They were the perfect sweet sidekicks to the matcha. My favorite of all three desserts I consumed before dinner was the black sesame creme brulee. It, to me, was reminiscent of the idea behind Massimo Bottura's dish consisting of parmesan three ways, albeit in different form and texture, though I doubt black sesame is in any danger of going bad. It's three elements were black sesame creme brulee, black sesame ice cream, and a crunchy black sesame lace cookie. The creme brulee was not too sweet or strong, with a crispy caramelized  shell and smooth texture. The ice cream seemed to be swirled with sesame as opposed to proliferated, and the cookie was crunchy and not sticky as this style of cookie, in my experience, tends to be. My second favorite dessert was the green tea parfait, featuring a small cookie, mochi, rice Krispies, a green tea cream, a green tea ice cream scoop, and some red bean paste. The combination of texture and temperature kept my palate from becoming bored with the consistent, singular flavor through out the dessert. My third dish was the homemade mochi in three flavors, chocolate Earl grey, green tea, and sesame, in order, the first rich and decedant, the second mediocre, and the third so strong it was left over - and I am not one to leave a clean plate unless my palate is dissatisfied. I rounded off the meal with a pot of tea, the name of which I can't recall but it's right below the matcha on the menu. It was grassy and tasted strongly of rice. Not something I'd recommend to a fan of American fruity tea bags - this packs a unique flavor punch, and I love it. The atmosphere with its dimmed lighting and little nooks and crannies is a perfect fit for a romantic date. Please note : this place is usually very full at night and if you come with a large group there will probably be at least a 30 min. Wait.
Chao C.}Brooklyn, NY}111}26}1}-1}4}10/28/2016}I like the tea here. The deserts are very expensive compare to the portion they give you.
Lama B.}Manhattan, NY}2}66}0}-1}4}10/28/2016}Incredible desserts here and it is such a zen little place where you really disconnect from the East Village outside.  One thing some restaurants do that I really dislike is when they give you the suggested tip and calculate it post-tax (with boxes to check).  I was going to pay more than that anyway, but when I see tactics like that, it turns me off, especially on days when the service was super slow and they made a mistake with our bill.  Can't give them a bad review though because I do love this place.
Teresa C.}Chicago, IL}160}71}75}-1}5}10/27/2016}A cute Japanese tea house with incredible desserts. The dinner menu is limited with only a couple of set options and some toast options. But everything that I've tried here so far has been incredibly amazing. Definitely don't overlook their toasts! We tried the salmon toast and the combination of Asian toast, mustard, and salmon keeps me coming back to this place. Definitely try their desserts!!  Personally, I love green tea/matcha. And they never disappoint with both the flavor and presentation.Finally, they have a long list of tea options. Perfect for a cold winter night! Like most places in NYC, you will need your entire party before they will let you in. So tell your friends not to be late!
Iris S.}Washington, DC}273}97}75}18}5}10/27/2016}I came in really full after dinner in the area and didn't think I could handle anything else. When it came to ordering, I suggested that the three of us share one dessert. Luckily, my friends had more sense than I did and we each ordered one dessert. Funnily enough, as soon as I started eating my second stomach kicked in and I was insatiable. Amongst the three of us I tried:- black sesame creme brulee: how I wish ever creme brulee was. creamy and decadent, with that punch of black sesame- green tea parfait: came with a scoop of matcha powder ice cream, mochi, red bean, and some rice krispies. I wish it came with more ice cream, but this was delicious- earl grey flan: "light" compared to the other desserts. If you like earl grey flavor, this is a great treat! Overall, these Japanese style desserts really hit the spot. Be warned that they're definitely pricey for the portion size, but at the very least you won't be disappointed by the execution!
Steve N.}Torrance, CA}989}961}1410}18}4}10/25/2016}Cha-An is a quaint little tea house located on E 9th St in St Marks. It is extremely popular with the locals and always boasts a wait time of 30 minutes plus. I usually only come here for desserts and late night tea, so if you're looking for a dinner review... I would read the other ones to get a feel for what they serve. The service was very hospitable despite the crowded hustle bustle going on. This spot is supposed to be a calm and relaxing environment for people to catch up and talk with friends, but New York on a Friday night is just not suited for that. Once you know what you want, my suggestion is just to get the order in as fast as possible. Otherwise, you miss your opportunity and no one will be there to help you for another 20 minutes. If you're going with a group, I would suggest ordering a Chef's Selection Dessert Sampler. It's a special selection that changes up every week, but usually all of their choices are outstanding. They have the best Black Sesame Créme Brulée... you can take my word for it. This is my second time here and I will definitely make the effort to come back!
Chloe G.}New York, NY}96}173}533}-1}5}10/24/2016}I can't believe I have been living in NYC for so long and have never been here. This place is awesome. It offers limited choice but they make each item in menu to perfection. This is Japanese spirit in core.  I really appreciate that. You won't go wrong with any choice here. Just pick a sets, it will include everything you need. Will come back.
Melodylu H.}Flushing, NY}35}50}93}-1}4}10/22/2016}It's cozy place for winter and food is tasty. My only complaint is, the place is quite small, so u have to expect a regular 30 minutes wait. I ordered a egg salad toast and chef's dessert sampler. I love them both! I have to mention about the bathroom, they have the best toilet which has lots of different functions, warming seat, cleaning, etc. so I added the last star for the bathroom!
Victoria C.}Taipei, Taiwan}33}114}202}18}5}10/17/2016}A quiet Japanese tea room tucked away on 9th, Cha-An is a great place to take your hardest-to-please friends (a good friend brought me here and I was blown away). There's an air of fine dining that isn't exploited by the modest restaurant and there's just enough room between guests and tables in the small space where you can get decent conversations without impeding on the experiences with others. Now let's talk about the food:Food (Desserts):+ Mochi mochi: An insta-worthy dish. The star of the show is the green tea ice cream. + 3 Mochi Balls: We got the chocolate, matcha, and red bean. If I could do it over again, I'd get ALL CHOCOLATES. + Sesame ice cream creme brulee: Another insta-worthy dish that will make all your friends jealous. This dish showcases sesame in 3 different forms - a baked, sweet brittle (with a tinge of bitterness that wonderfully balances the sweetness of the entire dish), ice cream (I like to describe it as light sweetness and resistant texture that 'holds' the dish together), and finally, a creme brulee, the coarser (flavor and texture wise) counterpart that melts the whole dish together.Drinks:+ Genmaicha: Looking for something different? Get the genmaicha for a flavorful cup of tea. The roasted brown rice adds an earthy and savory flavor to the cup. 5/5 Stars! Woohoo!
Hit U.}New York, NY}1}785}0}-1}4}10/13/2016}The green tea here is excellent, the green tea cake roll was very light and subtle, could barely taste it although I enjoyed it better than the red bean cake roll.
Jean H.}Boston, MA}300}24}106}-1}5}10/12/2016}Amazing Hojicha anmitsu, definitely worth the wait!
Sharon Y.}New York, NY}371}89}12}-1}5}10/12/2016}I decided to stop by here with my husband and friends after our dinner at Soba-ya. Although it was close to 8:30pm, this place was packed! We were initially turned away - we walked down a block and the host actually chased us down to let us know that they had a last minute cancellation! And we were super glad they did!This is hands-down the best Japanese dessert place I've been! My husband and I were aggressive and ordered three desserts: the black sesame creme brûlée, green tea parfait, and green tea ice-cream sandwich. The black sesame creme brûlée was definitely the winner of the trio. The creme brûlée came topped with sesame ice-cream. The top layer of caramel was perfectly crisp, the custard perfectly sweet and smooth, and the ice-cream created the most perfect combo. Extra bonus: this dish also came with some black sesame chip on top, which added the perfect crunch to the dessert. It is one of their most popular desserts and I can see why!The green tea parfait was also delicious! It came with green tea ice-cream, home-made mochi (amazing), red bean, and rice krispies. The mochi definitely stole the show with this dessert! I could have done without the ice-cream sandwich, but my husband seemed to enjoy it. It was green tea ice-cream wedged between two green-tea krispies. The ice-cream was good and the same as the one served in the parfait, but the green-tea krispies threw me off. It was a bit too matcha-like and overpowered the entire dessert. There are so many more desserts on the menu that I want to try - excited to return again!
Kathy W.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}3}-1}4}10/10/2016}This place had a great atmosphere as we were seated in a interior house in the restaurant. Came here for a small birthday party, and the food was really good. It was quality food and creative in the presentation. Not a big fan of the pricing though, I paid 8 dollars for a cup for a green tea latte that was lukewarm and just okay. I'd say go here for special events.
Lilly P.}New York, NY}263}16}35}-1}4}10/9/2016}One of my friends who was visiting NYC wanted to checl.this place out. It's a cute tiny Japanese restaurant. We started with Matcha Tea which was delicious. Afterwards, the food came and it was good especially the dessert!! The only thing I didn't like was the service. Although I understand it's a tiny place, it seem they were rushed in getting us out of there. Not a big fan of that but overall a good experience.
Kai H.}Queens, New York, NY}69}120}154}18}3}10/9/2016}Overhyped and overpriced.The space is tiny! Only about 10 tables and a special room in the back(for special reservations?)We came here and were surprised we didn't have to wait.The menu is quite simple with only 2 or 3 entrees and a few desserts. We skipped the cold dessert being it's quite cold today.I got eel over rice set, which tastes pretty good. The rice is multigrain and blended with sweet soy sauce. However, the food portion is tiny as compared with the high price tag. My bf got the egg salad toast. Sounds amazing right? However, the bread was a huge block and difficult to work with. The egg salad part was too salty and he said he would only give 2 stars for that.
Emily J.}New York, NY}374}355}664}18}2}10/7/2016}Woah. Thoroughly unimpressed with my meh experience. Could it be I carried high expectations? Who knows. My meal last night was not the anticipated meal I longed for. Came in on a Thursday night around 6:45 and figured there would be the usual hour long wait. To our surprise, there wasn't a wait and we were immediately seated. I chose the Chakura set with my choice dessert a matcha pudding verses the matcha bread and added on a matcha deluxe latte because ya'll probably know by now I LOVE matcha. The set came with a soup, bowl of rice, a veggie side dish that included okra and mushrooms, a salad with two slices of salmon sashimi and a chicken dish. Okra and Mushrooms: This tasted so gooey, slimy and unappetizing. I took a few bites and couldn't bear anymore!Salmon Salad: The salad dressing on top of the salmon was overly seasoned or too salty and overpowering. It left me feeling like I was drinking a bottle of dressing! (UGH!)Chicken: This tasted and smelled like it had been left out in a warm kitchen or reheated in the microwave. (YUCK!) Matcha Pudding: This was so bitter I was left confused and dismayed. The matcha pudding is not that sweet hojicha pudding you've probably tasted elsewhere. It's bitter and creamy. A combination I was definitely not prepared for after such a let-down meal. ON THE BRIGHT SIDEI liked the matcha deluxe latte I ordered, topped with matcha ice cream and red bean. But would I say it was worth $9? No.If I come back again, I'll be sure to try the other matcha desserts but will have to stray from food. WOMP, WOMP, WOMP.
Thien N.}Hartford, CT}1192}711}593}18}4}10/4/2016}Perfect for lovers of tea and elegant Japanese snacks. My girlfriend and I stopped by for some afternoon tea and dessert and it was delightfully lovely. Although wine, beer, and sake are available, we took advantage of the extensive tea list and decided on the hojicha, it was just great. The space is cozy and the décor is traditional as well -- wooden floors, tables, and booths; bamboo room dividers; rice-paper-shaded lamps giving off a warm glow; and fresh flower sprigs at each table -- just right for any kind of date. Try the hand-made mochi and green tea parfait if you're unsure of what to have -- they were delicious!
Nevena R.}Manhattan, NY}33}128}2}-1}5}10/2/2016}Super cute Japanese place with the best desserts and ambiance. I had the black sesame creme brûlée (good), chestnut panda cotta (spectacular), and matcha latte with ice cream (great)! Will definitely be coming here again.
Christine P.}New York, NY}201}8}5}-1}4}9/30/2016}they have the best japanese desserts and green tea latte! other than being a bit expensive, cha an is an amazing place to hang out with your baes
Rach S.}New York, NY}0}9}22}-1}4}9/26/2016}The salmon toast was awesome! The home made mochi was mouthwatering with rose scent!! Others are just okay. The price is on the high side compare to the amount of food you get. We also had green tea latte which we could do without. Will go back for the salmon toast and mochi only!
Dorothy L.}Montville, NJ}96}202}104}18}4}9/26/2016}This is a cozy little tea and dessert place in St. Marks... a little gem that i didn't know exist... tea is a little pricy, but they do come in a cute teapot and cup, and they will refill your tea pot when you need. Dessert is pretty good... they have a good selection - from green tea parfait, to mochi, to black sesame creme brûlée, and even simple brownie... :)  they taste very good and the ambiance is very nice... especially nice if you are on a date or hanging out with friends... will definitely go back for sure... :)
Becca H.}Hartford, CT}195}133}158}18}4}9/25/2016}I had been wanting to try this place several times, and am so glad I finally stopped in. It was the perfect afternoon treat. Walking in, it honestly feels like you've teleported to another city. Bamboo and wood walls/decor, plants, and open windowpanes make it feel like you've left NYC. They even have a small private room in the back which would be perfect for a secluded group outing. This would surely be a great spot for a date or to catch up with a friend in a quaint and cozy setting. The tea list was extensive, but we went with the hojicha which is a personal favorite. It has a toasted, nutty flavor (think roasted green tea) that is perfect for the fall weather. We got a pot of hojicha to share, but it was quite small and only enough for two small cups. For dessert we shared the Green Tea Parfait (one scoop of green tea ice cream, matcha cream, red bean, rice crispies, mochi, and topped with a matcha cookie) and the Handmade Mochi (one of each: black sesame, green tea, earl grey chocolate). The Green Tea Parfait was my favorite and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the idea of a green tea dessert piled high with all the right toppings. The Handmade Mochi was also good, but I preferred the Green Tea and Earl Grey Chocolate flavors over the black sesame. I would definitely come back and bring another tea/dessert lover with me. They do serve food as well, but with dessert that good I'd go just for the sweets.
Melissa H.}New York, NY}5}38}52}-1}5}9/21/2016}Love this tea house! Service was attentive and the menu is the perfect balance of sweet and savory. We ordered the hojicha anmitsu, mochi mochi and green tea parfait and two pots of tea - genmai cha and dragon well.  Needless to say we were in a dessert kinda mood.  Everything was delicious!
Tomoe S.}Providence, RI}0}55}13}-1}5}9/19/2016}As we walked in, there were people lined up on narrow stairs leading up the the restaurant upstairs. I thought this would take a long time..... When we were almost close to the first in line, the guest in front of us tried to check in for 4 people. The waitress told him, they can not accept a group who has a missing number. Apparently his friends weren't even close to the restaurant yet at the time he tried to reserve a table. So he was set aside and we could go in before them. That was it. Seating was full after us.We ordered lunch set and we each ordered different type of Japanese tea to go with. I must say, every tea tasted excellent! The food, yes, as I read through the review, excellent!!! Our daughter loved the dessert so much asking me to create the same at home.....I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic Japanese food.
E. W.}Queens, NY}0}6}5}-1}4}9/18/2016}My friend and i ordered from their lunch menu and added  $3 for their mini dessert. Portions were small but very healthy. I was looking forward to try their desserts and teas but since i wasn't feeling that well i didn't get to try them. Next time.
Asa N.}Brooklyn, NY}18}109}165}-1}4}9/14/2016Updatedreview}After a not so good dinner, stopped by here for drinks and desserts with friends. Since my last update, I didn't go back once. The sesame creme burlee and panna cotta were really good last night. I also enjoyed my iced green tea latte deluxe. We sat by the window and the music was loud from downstairs. The speakers were under my table.
Star Z.}New York, NY}266}86}539}18}4}9/12/2016}The desserts here feature green tea and matcha, which I love. They had a large range of different desserts from cakes to ice creams. However, their food are a little too sweet for me and I could not taste the flavor of tea any more. The decor was great. Although it was packed when I was there, it was not noisy.
christie c.}New York, NY}1}62}263}-1}5}9/10/2016}I always loving going there for tea and desserts. When I first went there when was like 10 something years ago, the place was so quiet but now, so many young kid and so loud. There used to be a tea ceremony room but now it is replaced with more tables. The food and service remain 5 stars!
Sunny S.}UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA}18}4}1}-1}1}9/6/2016}the server guy is really rude...There is nobody at the waiting place, and he insisted that we go finish the drink we got elsewhere downstairs on the street, and it's raining outside..We ordered two desserts and left in 10 min, the food is so-so and overpriced btw, and he took our bill right after i signed, i didnt even notice him i was ready, so that he could see how much we pay before we leave and then detained us and keep asking us why less than 18% (he didnt even serve us, and for his bad attitude i dont want to tip at all!This place is definitely overpriced and not that good in food quality/quantity comparing to the many other desert place in the city. I will not go here in the future.
Jenny P.}Brooklyn, NY}147}15}19}-1}5}9/6/2016}Lovely tea house in St marks! The ambiance of this place took me back to when I was in Japan. The inner decor is well suiting but the real gem of this place is their variety and selection of tea. If you are a fan of barley tea or different herbal teas that have a zen feel to it this is the place for you. Their assorted dessert platter was not really all too impressive but their earl tea cream brûlée was amazing. I would definitely come back for tea next time I have time to sit and enjoy a nice cup of tea in a hectic nyc life style!
Ling M.}Greenwood, NY}292}26}15}-1}5}9/3/2016}Such a cute spot for me and my girl to get dessert. Hope it gets me some tonight fingers crossed. But the teas are great. They give you your own personal pot to fill your cup. The desserts are bomb. I got the ice cream sandwich and baby girl got the sesame crime brûlée. They were both sooo gooodddddd. Swag sauce a thousand ma G.
Cody C.}Austin, TX}5}17}0}-1}1}8/31/2016}We came here at 10:20PM on a Wednesday night, their website says they close at 11PM. We were denied service even after stating we were just coming in for some tea.
Karen Z.}Flushing, NY}92}25}129}-1}5}8/31/2016}Cha An is a Japanese teahouse located on E. 9th St between 2nd and 3rd avenues. They have a lot of good food and desserts aside from their various teas. It is one of my favorite dine-in spots. I discovered it almost two years ago and I come here every once in a while now. Tonight, I ordered the Chiran Sencha (a type of green tea). The tea comes with a small teapot that they refill for you over the course of your meal. I also ordered the Smoked Salmon Toast, which is a favorite here. I recommend this and the Grilled Salmon Toast. Both are very delicious! Just choose one based on the kind of salmon you want. It is perfect for anyone, unless you're allergic to fish or are vegetarian. The texture of the toast is crispy on the outside but very soft and airy on the inside. It comes topped with leafy greens, salmon, and a delicious sauce. They also have sweet toasts, such as the Raspberry Butter Toast, but I find them too sweet. I prefer the savory toasts -- Just one is enough to satisfy your stomach. I like ordering a dessert after my meal, and today I tried the Hojicha Anmitsu. It is a green tea jelly with shiratama mochi, brown sugar syrup, azuki (red bean), and green tea ice cream. The green tea jelly tastes like brewed green tea in a jello form, so it is not sweet at all. But it all balances out with the sweetness of the azuki and green tea ice cream. I think that it can do without the brown sugar syrup, which is a little too sweet. The mochi is perfect. I love it. My favorites from here are the Smoked and Grilled Salmon Toasts, the green tea parfait (one of the best parfaits you'll have in your life), the dessert sampler (is never disappointing), the ice cream sandwich (green tea rice crispies treats with Hojicha ice cream, a caramelized black sesame crisp, a raspberry and strawberry),...etc. I have yet to try more! They update their menu once in a while, so if you come here periodically, you can try new things! You never have to worry about food quality. It's outstanding. In terms of the atmosphere, this restaurant has traditional Japanese decor. They usually play jazz music, and the noise level is based on time and day. It is a dim restaurant. Goes well with the jazz and beautiful decor. Very cozy feeling. I recommend this place to everyone. Absolutely wonderful.
Justin P.}Boston, MA}6}109}12}-1}4}8/30/2016}Adorable idea, intimate little seating area, a bit westernized for my taste but it is in the U.S. Tea is great actually and overall there is a very calm vibe, perfect for metaphysical thoughts over a good cup of Oolong. Definitely one of the places to go if you're wandering and don't feel like having a full dinner or being in a rush at a regular coffee place.
Jac H.}Chantilly, VA}31}124}282}-1}5}8/28/2016}The Black Sesame Créme Brulée is everything. I met up with some family and friends here - my friends and I first time, but my cousin frequents often. She gave us tips on what to order, and everything she had suggested was spot on. The black sesame créme brulée is definitely one of the things we ate there when we were visiting. And the teas are so smooth. Service was great, my cousin that it was only 2 of us coming, but we had a group of 4. She was sitting at the bar and when the host found out we had more, we were accommodated surprisingly immediately.  I think we were lucky that time. The price point is fairly decent, but remember to bring cash!
Chani W.}New York, NY}0}12}6}-1}4}8/28/2016}This place is amazing! The decoration is very welcoming as well as the staff members. I went there on its off peak hours so I kinda had the restaurant to myself (even though this place usually gets busy all the time). I love their dessert, especially their shaved-ice. There are 2 flavors to it: Strawberry and Green tea. To me the sweetness is just right. I got the strawberry one and it gives me the sweetness from the condensed milk with a little but of sour from the strawberry. What I love most about it is how they put both the strawberry syrup and the condensed milk on the side, so you can decide how much you really wanna add in. There are 2 reasons I took a star off: 1. There is little space inside the restaurant so it gets busy very easily and they dont accept reservation. 2. The food here is a bit pricy. Other than that, the rest is fantastic! I definitely would come back!
Miki A.}New York, NY}21}12}9}-1}3}8/28/2016}Okay pretty overhype its okay. But not like the best Japanese restaurant you can eat in. Will probably not go back but it was a good experience though.
Joanne W.}Berlin, Germany}124}641}368}18}5}8/27/2016}I've been here so many times now, that it's kind of ridiculous. If I want to have a chill night to chat with some friends for dinner or dessert, this is where I go. Lunch is also good here too - but it's been a while since I've been there around that time.The set dinner (Chakura set) is pretty awesome -- but I can see how some people might not like it. It's a pretty healthy set dish for $24 or so (including dessert)! Surprisingly enough, it fills you up -- but enough. Not to the point that you're rolling out of the place, and not to the point where you're like "I need to eat more."With regards to dessert, I love every single one of them. I usually get the Chef's choice, because I want EVERYTHING. And honestly, it never disappoints.Just a warning though! The matcha affogato contains alcohol in it, and that confused the crap outta me.Otherwise, favorite place ever.
Rhoda S.}Wooster, OH}2}13}31}-1}4}8/26/2016}The environment is very nice other than it is a small restaurant. Food tastes good and looks beautiful.
Shuang W.}Waterloo, Canada}185}110}217}18}5}8/25/2016}The toast was so nice! The environment was cozy too! We tried out the matcha drink and it was too thick but still awesome!
Sofia M.}Brooklyn, NY}150}95}33}-1}5}8/21/2016}Come here for the desserts!!!Though a bit pricey, but their desserts are awesome - had the black sesame creme brulee and the hojicha anmitsu
Judith L.}Manhattan, NY}0}65}0}-1}4}8/14/2016}An interesting Japanese restaurant. Came here to have some desserts with my friend. The food is delicate, but a bit too sweet. It would be better to have the dessert with green tea.
Sarah T.}Hong Kong}178}472}2589}18}3}8/13/2016}I think Cha An is a bit overhyped at the moment. Given the ridiculous wait time and the not so impressive cost performance, i might stop going there for a while.First of all, the portion is super tiny- Given the price tag. The dessert is good but some of them are borderline average.I really like the sesame creme brulee while the icecream sandwich was rather weird. Matcha Parfait was ok.
LY L.}Sacramento, CA}13}169}2112}-1}4}8/12/2016}Amazing desserts! My review is strictly about desserts and Cha-An can blow your socks off.  If this is your first time at Cha-An, get the Chef's sampler - it has a little bit of everything nice on it. Below are my favorites and they aren't necessarily in any order:Mochi pieces with black sesame or green tea, soft smooth silky mochi on the outside with delicious paste of black sesame or green tea fillings. They also offer earl grey chocolate but I'm not that into chocolate and definitely not a fan of earl grey.Shaved ice with matcha and condensed milk dressing...oh where do I begin to tell you how delicious this treat is.  It is a must try dessert especially during summer. Be noted that they stop serving shaved ice at 6 pm.Black sesame creme brûlée - it comes with a scoop of ice cream and the nutty taste of black sesame is evident in every bite; nutella doesn't stand a chance against black sesame.There are several other dessert options besides what listed above and they are all delicious but their names escape me. Go to Cha-An and check them out, you won't be disappointed.
Ho Yi K.}Coquitlam, Canada}115}41}43}-1}4}8/4/2016}Only had dessert here, but I definitely felt the Japanese vibe. I loved the two desserts we ordered, but be warned that there is a minimum fee per person. We were only looking for a quick dessert but ended up having to order two. The mochi is something you definitely have to try!
Dianna H.}Daly City, CA}101}413}1805}18}3}8/4/2016}Came here this past Saturday to catch up with a friend over tea and desserts. Arrived around 3 and we were able to get seated immediately. It's a very small space on the second floor of the building, so it does fill up quickly! There was a couple groups waiting by the time we left around 4:30.Everything here definitely is very pricey. I ordered the green tea parfait (most expensive parfait I've ever had at a whopping $11!) with chamomile tea ($6). The green tea parfait was okay, but I have had better. It wasn't too sweet, which was great, but I thought it was kind of odd that they put a couple of tang yuan (small round balls made from glutinous rice flour mixed with water), which I always thought was a Chinese thing, in the parfait. I've had other Japanese parfaits, and usually the mochi they use is the dry type. I'm not a big fan of tang yuan so that detracted from the whole dessert for me. In addition to the tang yuan, they also have: anko (red bean paste), matcha cream, rice cracker, crispy cereal bits at the very bottom, and some more stuff I've probably forgotten. Overall it was good, but not worth the $11.The chamomile tea was very fragrant and served as a good complement to the green tea parfait.Service was great. Our server came to check up on us frequently and was really good about refilling our water when the glass was empty.
菁菁}New York, NY}0}11}52}-1}5}7/29/2016}I have to say that this place is so good and especially when I am so nostalgic about green tea dessert in Japan. And the egg sandwich is also good for the thick flavour and well-baked bread. Now so regret that I didn't know this place earlier.
Susan J.}New York, NY}5}107}2}-1}2}7/24/2016}Came here with another friend around 4pm on the weekend. We were seated at the bar right away. Minus one star: It took over 10 minutes to get our water as well as for our waiter to take our order.Minus one star: This place is expensive for what they are offering. We paid over $20 with tip included for two desserts. I guess that's not too bad but  I've been to Japan and tried countless black sesame and green tea ice creams all over Manhattan and was disappointed. The black sesame ice cream was very strong (which I enjoy it was also super sweet. The green tea ice cream was too sweet for my taste.Overall I think for the price the quality was certainly not worth it and the service was too slow.
David W.}Owensboro, KY}0}1}0}-1}3}7/24/2016}Food was great. But the waiter named Ryo had the worst service in any restaurant I've ever been to. He has no clue what the concept of customer service is.
Ciel C.}State College, PA}168}46}112}-1}5}7/21/2016}I went there three times and every experience were amazing, especially the first one. The first time the three of us ordered five desserts after dinner. Our fav was black sesame creme brûlée. It was not super sweet and had nutty flavor from black sesame which we all enjoyed. The black sesame crisp on top was just brilliant.Green tea parfait was our second favorite. Loved the matcha flavor and the chewy rice cake.However, we all agreed that mochi, chocolate soufflé and the seasonal flan were just okay. They were good, but nothing special. The second time I went there, I ordered red bean toast. The toast was perfectly toasted; very crunchy on the outside. The red bean paste was not overly sweet and it made a great pair with the buttery soft bread inside.However, I have to admit that the third time I was not impressed. I got 15 grain rice set. Nothing special. The one best thing was the salad dressing that came with salmon. My mom and my roommate ordered grilled salmon toast and smoked salmon toast. According to my mom, the grilled salmon was a little bit fishy. I will still highly recommend this place to any of my friend if they are visiting Manhattan and wanting to have some exquisite desserts. And I will revisit Cha-An in the near future myself.
Monica N.}New York, NY}97}3}0}-1}5}7/20/2016}Amazing teas and desserts. Great place for after dinner or just because.
jessie c.}Bonita, CA}0}2}0}-1}1}7/17/2016}Bad service when the waiter saw we came with a baby. We have 3 adults and 3 teenagers. We got tea with no taste, gave less than 1/2 teaspoon of tea leave and said that's their custom. Came in @9:20pm and denied service when website said it closes at 10pm. They emphasized that minimum charge is $6 per person. We ended up ordering $120 worth of food, obviously enough, but still got poor and rude service, but demand 18% tip. Can't believe this! We'll never come back again!!!!!!!
Mu C.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}155}47}62}-1}4}7/16/2016}Such a cute little place in st marks. Perfect for afternoon tea/brunch. They have a wide selection of tea and dessert.  I recommend the Japanese green tea if you are a tea lover  for sake infused ice cream for dessert.
Natalie Z.}Manhattan, NY}1}109}13}-1}4}7/15/2016}A great place for girls in love with green tea flavor. I have lots of girlfriends who love green tea dessert, this place makes them very happy. I am not a big fan of green tea but I like seafood, so  to speak, it's a win-win situation for my girls small party :)
Michael L.}New York, NY}86}121}625}18}4}7/13/2016}Place is great, i knock a star because the price is skyrocket. I am not one to complain about price, but i do understand what overpriced actually means and i eat at overpriced places quite often and sometimes i may claim it as such. This place is overpriced for sure and it is Japanese so it is expected. The deserts here are great and delicious for sure and worth it when you feel like splurging on desert. They have a nice sampler, but it is just that, a sampler. Expect portions to be small if you are a westerner like myself.The entire block is filled with japanese businesses and is very fun and interesting. Lot's to do around here.
Yue Mary W.}New York, NY}262}190}34}-1}3}7/13/2016}I was looking forward to coming here but i did not have a great experience.I came here in a group of 6 and our wait was over an hour long. They sat us at a very tiny corner and we were pretty much on top of each other. The customer service wasn't great and we constantly needed to flag down a waiter/waitress. My man and I shared a sample app and a dessert sampler dish. The portions were so tiny and let's just say we left extremely hungry. You are paying a lot for so little food. The teas were nothing spectacular. The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because some of the desserts were pretty good.Unfortunately, I did not have a great experience here and would most likely not return.
Melody C.}Los Angeles, CA}16}18}2}-1}5}7/10/2016}I always come here when I visit NYC. They have really good dessert. I tried different food every time I visit. Sesame ice cream and machi are my favorite
Caitlin B.}New York, NY}27}31}34}-1}2}7/5/2016}I really wanted to try Cha An because of its high Yelp reviews and delicious-looking desserts. I came in one night when the place was half-empty. Considering how many empty tables there were in the restaurant, I thought it would be fine if I waited for my friend while sitting down. But no, the server told me to stay put at the door until my friend arrived. I was bummed, but I shrugged it off anyway. Onto the desserts: we tried the Mochi Mochi and Black Sesame Creme Brulee. The presentation for the Mochi Mochi was cute, but when the dessert arrived half of the green tea ice cream was already melted - not cool. The mochis were pretty chewy though. My friend and I weren't big fans of the Black Sesame Creme Brulee - too overpowering and we were sick of it after 2 spoonfuls. What really disappointed me was the server complaining why we tipped 10% instead of the expected gratuity of 18%. We told her that the food and service wasn't great, then she walked away and proceeded to speak Japanese with the other servers while they gave us looks. I have never experienced this at any restaurant/establishment, especially one that claims to be Japanese! Most Japanese places do not even allow tipping, let alone have their servers ask for MORE tip. That made me and my friend feel so uncomfortable. .
Wing C.}Downtown, Los Angeles, CA}205}1267}8338}18}3}7/1/2016}I ate my fair share of dessert parfait while in Japan this past year. I was ecstatic when my bestie brought me to Cha-an after learning that they offer their own version of matcha parfait. The presentation was spot on - mochi, green tea ice cream, red bean paste, chestnut, rice crispy, and matcha cookie - delish! However the portion was probably half of what I had in Japan. In addition, they put in an overwhelming amount of whipped cream. Wished they swapped out half of the whipped cream for an extra scoop of green tea ice cream instead. There were mouthful of whipped cream at times (the colour and appearance looked almost the same as the ice cream) - I felt a bit cheated with every bite. My bestie ordered the seasonable flan - which I thought was the perfect dessert for anyone who wants something more subtle and less overwhelmingly sweet. It has an floral aftertaste which we both loved. Overall - great dessert options but nothing stood out to draw me back any time soon. Perhaps would come back for their savory items next time.
Syyu C.}Manhattan, NY}508}255}1299}18}4}6/28/2016}Such a cute tea house and dessert spot! The place is very charming with wooden and bamboo décor that provides a serene atmosphere. Space is small but intimate and cozy. We waited 20 minutes for a party of 4 late Sunday night. I can imagine the wait being a lot longer during peak hoursWe came here just for the desserts. The server recommended the Chef's Selection Dessert Sampler ($20) as it was our first time and for us to try a little bit of everything. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. We enjoyed the black sesame creme brulee, jasmine ice cream, green tea short bread cookies, and also ordered the Sakura Flam ($9) to complement the dessert sampler.  The desserts were not overly sweet and not super rich/heavy which was very refreshing. It is a bit pricey but definitely an experience worth trying as it is an authentic Japanese teahouse and a popular spot in East Village.
Monika R.}New York, NY}74}37}21}-1}1}6/27/2016}It doesn't matter how good the food is, service is everything. The attitude and lack of care from our waitress "Tama" today made me decide to never go back. It was awkward and uncomfortable to ask anything of her, and when my friends and I did, she acted as though it was an inconvenience. I will add though, that there was another waitress who helped us more and was very kind even though she wasn't our waitress. Yes, the food was good if you're into the finer Japanese food (small portions for rather high$$), but who wants to sit there eating anything while feeling like you're an inconvenience and then get a pricey check afterwards?
Jelani R.}Brooklyn, NY}228}107}243}-1}4}6/26/2016}Super awesome dessert place in East Village, matcha green tea latte was definitely a highlight. The vibe and atmosphere is really cool and perfect after a full day in the village.
Emily C.}New York, NY}179}62}528}-1}3}6/25/2016}I had super high expectations before visiting this place but was quite let down. While their service is the best of the best and all their waiters were super sweet, the desserts were just mediocre. I ordered a Mochi Mochi, which was Hojicha ice cream with rice balls and green tea mochis. The ice cream was so good and refreshing and the rice balls and green tea mochi were as expected and quite good. The reason I give this place a three star is because of the sweet syrup they add in my dessert (pools at the bottom of the bowl). The syrup was WAY too sweet and sadly ruined the dessert for me. :(I also tried a bit of my friend's sesame creme brûlée and it was also too sweet and repetitive. Wish their desserts weren't as sweet, otherwise, I would definitely return to try more of their desserts.
Jessica K.}New York, NY}162}329}1081}18}4}6/24/2016}Great dessert place!I enjoyed the desserts here, but not a big fan of their food items. My favorite has to be the black sesame creme brûlée! It was so delicious!The restaurant is quite small but cozy. Just be ready for a line, we had to wait a while before being seated.
Nanciee C.}Brooklyn, NY}49}226}214}-1}4}6/19/2016}Such a cute and comfortable area to have some dessert! I had been around the area several other times, trying to come in, but due to there being a crowd of people ahead, had to go back out to find an alternative. The last time I visited was with my cousin, and thank goodness for not needing to wait cuz we finally got seated! Yay.I forgot what exactly we ordered, but I know we got a set and some other dessert to try, and no regrets. Deliciousness. The whole time, it was "oooohh" or "mmm." At first, it can feel a bit expensive because the food comes in a small size, such that if you're with a guy, he may gobble everything all up in a bite or two. Definitely not food that you'd be full over, but good for a chatting and munching session.I would like to come back to actually enjoy their teas and other menu items. Not too excited for what I may need to pay, but it's all for the experience to try the tea in a tea-based environment.
Y. P.}Arlington, VA}0}7}0}-1}5}6/16/2016}Always a lovely place for a chat with a good friend. Their black sesame creme brulee is sublime, and they have the nicest bathroom (seriously).
Sylvia J.}Queens, NY}196}86}198}-1}3}6/8/2016}Before attending a show last week, a friend suggested us to get tea. When we first got there, I asked for a table for four. Three of us were here, waiting on one friend. She said we'd have to wait. Then asked me for my name to add us to the waitlist. There was a huge language barrier as I had to spell my name super slowly only to see the lady have down 'Sydia' on the paper .-. Anyway, we got a table right after our last friend arrived. The menu was extensive and looked really great (all the desserts) and the tea too. The process of the tea was interesting. Pricey place and not really a place worth my while coming back to for a while.We ordered:- Black Sesame Créme Brulée (best of the desserts but I wouldn't come here alone to eat it- I like my dessert in small bites, not in bulk--most memorable of all things we ordered though!)- Honey Oolong tea - yummy -- sweet & woody - Peach Oolong - ehh...didn't taste peach at all? Honey oolong wins. - Green tea parfait - Green tea ice cream with mochi
Cindy L.}Brooklyn, NY}92}87}104}-1}5}6/7/2016}Everything looked so amazing on the menu I wish I came in here hungrier. I only ordered the green tea latte deluxe (which comes with matcha ice cream and red bean). Delicious! Not overly sweet as most ice creams and lattes are, the matcha is perfectly balanced with the latte and red bean, the only thing that's awkward is that they use ice cubes which makes it hard to eat the ice cream.Would defiantly want to come back to try their lunch and food, the eel, fish, and small desserts look amazing!
Michele S.}Chino Hills, CA}273}356}887}18}3}5/30/2016}It is the first time i am here. It is a tiny place for Japanese dessert. there is usually wait b/c the place is tiny. We ordered chef's selection and green tea latte. I am not sure why this place has such high review on yelp, but i thought the dessert are just alright and its service is really bad. We had to ask our server for water after sitting there for 20 minutes. and our server dropped our dessert plate when she was serving our dessert plate and she didnt' even apologize for it..Its service is really horrible considering it is a JAPANESE restaurant.The price is on the higher side vs other dessert places in NYC. I would not come back again b/c of its poor service, average quality dessert, and its price
Tracy N.}New York, NY}395}32}41}-1}5}5/28/2016}Had the unagi lunch special. Came with genmai cha (tea).Lovely, lovely, lovely. It's a perfect spot to have old world tea (Eastern style).Thank you.
Danesh J.}Jersey City, NJ}177}385}466}-1}5}5/28/2016}Some many options at this place for desserts and teas. Great for a nightcap or to chat with some friends. Can get a bit crowded, so make a reservation before heading over. They have bar seating but, again, it's limited. What to get? Try anything really. I got the green tea affogato because I love affogatos. So follow your stomach-heart, and you should be okay.
Candice C.}Emeryville, CA}263}46}106}-1}4}5/27/2016}I came to Cha-An one afternoon to kill a little time before meeting a friend. This spot was great for a little bit of me-time on a Tuesday afternoon. No wait and fairly calm atmosphere. I ordered Flower Craft Tea ($9 yikes) which was fragrant and light. I noticed some other yelp comments about people getting charged extra for refills on hot water, but I had two refills with no extra charge. On my second tea refill I decided to try the seasonal flan($9), cherry blossom. Boy did it jiggle!! I give this dessert an A+ on texture. The flan itself actually tasted like green tea, but there was a cherry blossom on top, which was compliment because it was a bit tart and had a floral plum taste. Overall I had a nice experience and considering I spent over two hours here nursing one cup of tea and a dessert I don't really mind that the bill was a little "steep" (tea pun!) Since i was on vacation, it was worth it to avoid a bunch of kids with their laptops at a Starbucks.
Mark B.}Houston, TX}76}13}4}-1}5}5/25/2016}Came here this afternoon to relax with a nice pot of green tea. I sat at the bar, as the place was busy and I didn't want to take up more space than I needed. I've enjoyed good green tea from one of my best friends who's from Japan for many years, so I generally know what I like. I chatted it up with the server behind the bar to see if I could try something new and get a good recommendation. I told her what my favorites were, and she immediately had a pick for me. And it was *stellar*. Loved it. The tea was perfect, presentation is wonderful, and the staff is wonderful and knowledgable. I totally recommend this place, and look forward to going back!
Yasu Y.}New Milford, NJ}0}5}0}-1}4}5/16/2016}Their tea selection is amazing! I also love their seasonal pudding! I've tried a couple but I think my favorite was the chestnut pudding they had during their fall season. I know part of their charm is being a small establishment, but since so many people try to come here and it's always booked, maybe it's time to find a bigger location?
William M.}Manhattan, NY}1}55}7}-1}4}5/16/2016}Most of the reviewers for Cha-An focus on the desserts, but there's more here, all nicely done.The restaurant is on the second floor, up a rather dark staircase to a small waiting area/landing, then thru the hanging curtain to the restaurant.The room has been very thoughtfully designed and decorated - butterflies in wall recesses, a small semi-private room, a nook, with rich wood, the light from outside muted - very inviting, and reflecting the theme of the restaurant.  The rest of the experience is similarly thoughtful and nicely executed. In addition to the desserts cited by so many reviewers, they have a small selection of meal ensembles - seven grain rice or porridge, mackerel or salmon or tuna or eel, pickled lotus root, seaweed, tofu, all served at once in a bowl donburi or in a set of small dishes.  The food was fresh and tasty, well prepared, and very traditional.We also ordered a "salmon toast" which was a large chunk of sliced bread, delicately toasted, with a generous portion of smoked salmon on top - no dainty toast points here.Cha-An offers a wide variety of teas, as you might expect, with tasting notes for each to provide some guidance.  On the day I visited they were out of the oolong type that I requested, but the waiter was up-to-date, and could suggest an off-menu alternative. The tea service itself comes with all the trappings - small cups, a slotted tray to discard rinses and cold tea.  This could be intimidating, but the waiter was willing to explain it all.  The waiter and waitress were patient, courteous and responsive.The desserts were rich - we sampled five - and enjoyed them all - I'll leave the details to other reviewers. The tables are a bit small, especially when you factor in a set of dishes and tea cups and tea pots and strainers and hot water carafes and napkins and chopsticks and spoons and...but on the other hand there is a wide central aisle and the room doesn't feel overcrowded or claustrophobic, as so many places do.  There's also a bar at the end of the room with a few seats.Bottom line:  If you enjoy Japanese food, tea and culture, and don't mind the crowded tables, Cha-An is a nice, relaxing restaurant to get a good healthy meal, to catch up with friends over dessert and tea, or just enjoy something different.
Kevin E.}Brooklyn, NY}81}544}817}18}3}5/14/2016}Came here with my bro for dessert. We got here a little after 2 and there were already a few people waiting on line to be seated. The lady will ask you for your name and how many people are in your group and then give you a very accurate estimate of how long the wait time will be. For us (group of 2), it was about a 10 min wait. The decor is very nice! I really liked the Japanese decorations and the seating. Everything was also very clean. I'm sure the atmosphere would be absolutely amazing/tranquil with less people. But, this place is popular and is always packed so it can be a little on the noisier side, thus disrupting the zen lmao. Service was pretty attentive.I was stuck between ordering two desserts or getting the Chef's Selection Dessert Sampler. However, as a true foodie and lover of trying new things, I just couldn't resist getting something with the word "sampler" in the name lol. It was $20 and comes with 5 random mini desserts. For our sampler, we got:Black sesame creme brulee- It was pretty good. The top had a nice and crispy charred layer. The creme had a nice consistency and was bursting with black sesame flavor.Black sesame ice cream- Very refreshing. Most of the black sesame ice cream that I've had elsewhere was too heavy. The one here was very light but still retained the same great black sesame flavor.Green tea and chocolate shortbread- It was alrightt. Nothing special.Citron cake- I would say was my favorite one in the sampler! The cake had a nice citrusy taste to it and was soft but slightly chewy as well! Comes with a cream and citrus sauce on top that had a good balance of sweet and sour.Red bean mochi- Wasn't a fan of this.I think I would've liked this place more if I had ordered 2 desserts instead of the sampler. While I did like most of what we got in the sampler, the portions were just too small. The sampler is obviously meant to be shared since you're not going to eat $20 of desserts yourself but between 2 people, we only got like 1-2 bites of each dessert. Looking around, the portions of the regular desserts seemed much bigger yet still shareable. Overall, I would say this is a nice place to visit with a friend or a date but I would suggest ordering the regular desserts and skipping the sampler since it wasn't really worth it.
Brandy C.}New York, NY}499}608}461}18}4}5/6/2016}Only recommend to come here for desserts. Savory food is just okay. Didn't surprise us much, but the dessert is def worth to go back again.
Max L.}King of Prussia, PA}33}22}80}-1}4}5/5/2016}I am not a big fan of matcha. To me, it just doesn't look, taste, or even smell nature. In my head, tea should not come in powder form and in no way can be that bright green. It tastes like grind up green chalks!!! So when my wife wanted to go this place, I was VERY reluctant. But hey...that woman can be very persuasive. As any good eateries in NYC during weekend afternoon, this place was buzzing.  We waited for about half hours before seated at bar. Staffs were all very busy and tried very hard to be as attentive as possible. I guess because it's a tea house so its menu seems to be on the "light" side. I didn't see many gut busting items nor heavy dishes in its menu. We were just there for deserts anyway so we ordered an ice matcha latté and black sesame crème brulee. Took a good while for our orders to arrive. But it gave us a good chance to enjoy the place and looked over the bar into its really busy kitchen. One interesting note, I don't the reason behind it, it was a real long wait for our crème brulee while there was one just sited at the kitchen window but none of the staffs seemed to notice it. Meanwhile, we were like..."is that ours..." the whole time and I was about to finish my latte, which was very surprisingly good BTW. Until one of the staffs noticed it and asked the kitchen in Japanese. She turned around with big wide-open eyes looking around the store tried to figure out who ordered it. Then there was me, right at the bar, putted both my hands out and gave her the "come to papa" pose. It's a funny moment. Crème brulee was good, heavy on the sesame taste, but we really enjoyed it.
C Y.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}3}5/3/2016}Cute place for afternoon tea and a snack but they are weird about not giving you hot water (they said that they only have enough hot water for teas).
Priscilla Z.}Los Angeles, CA}771}846}1916}18}4}4/25/2016}We had some dessert at this place. It is such a cute place. It is intimate inside==tiny space.We came in 2pm on a Monday, quite a lot of people in already. We had the green tea parfait, which is huge, I enjoyed it. And also a seasonal flan, which I couldn't tell the taste of it. I don't like flan in general, so I would pass that one. The tea is really good. But after asking for adding hot water for 3 times, I was told it would be charged!!! Oh well, I guess they just don't want us to stay there forever chatting. Fine, then I will leave.
Nikki L.}Manhattan, NY}204}1037}104}18}5}4/23/2016}Excellent desserts, both times I've been here I've enjoyed the sweets.The deluxe matcha latte was a cold matcha drink with the addition of tasty vanilla ice cream and sweetened red beans. Without the ice cream and beans the drink would be a little plain.The mochi mochi, had good hojicha ice cream (very mild flavor), with soft, white mochi (shiratama) and warabimochi (green tea mochi with a much softer, squisher, almost jelly-like consistency.)There is a cute, little teahouse atmosphere here with traditional Japanese decorations. Use of wood throughout, small teahouse front in the corner, bamboo-like decor.)
Holly X.}New York, NY}0}26}82}-1}4}4/22/2016}Dessert is great! I think the best of Cha An is their dessert, especially black sesame ice cream. You can try the dessert sample which has five small desserts.
Tina W.}New York, NY}421}905}1193}18}4}4/22/2016}Location: Cha-An is hidden on E 9th street. A small door and a long upstairs will lead you to your final destination of Cha-An. Small, but japanese, Cha-an is decorated with clearly beautiful japanese styles, including their inner design and their bar.Food: We have the menu for a while because we did not know what to order. Clearly, there are very limited options for late-night hanging out. My friend wanted some brunch entree, which they do not offer. We ended up with a green tea parfait, mochi, and hot mocha. Very very very delicious! I love their green tea parfait, deep green tea inside the ice cream, with crispy cereal, with red beans, and green tea cream. It 's balanced but I wished that they could have two scopes of green tea ice cream, and no crispy cereal...Mochi is randomly assigned flavors by them. They do provide green tea , and we also have a chocolate one.Pretty dense I would say, but still worth every penny to try.Service: there's always a line waiting inside and outside. When you got there, they would take your name you phone number and tell you that they will contact you once there's a place to seat. We waited about 10 minutes and but during brunch time, waiting time would be longer.Overall: I will settle with 4 stars. Interesting but only worth one-time visit.
Yurika M.}New York, NY}1}5}0}-1}1}4/22/2016}I went Cha An around late afternoon.It's was not crowded at all. But I felt the worker obviously doesn't want me and my friends to stay at there so long.It's was super uncomfortable to stay there as one of customer.Why the worker doesn't let customer relax and enjoy their foods?If that is the crowded time or people are waiting for the table, I understand.Totally broke my mood and even their food's taste is fine, never wanna go.Can't believe this is a Japanese restaurant's service.
Bob R.}Kings Park, NY}0}36}5}-1}5}4/19/2016}First time here. Got a lunch sampler, raspberry toast and dragon well. Everything was excellent.
Aradhana D.}Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY}2}14}0}-1}5}4/19/2016}The ratings say it all, this place is just so good. I almost always go here if I'm in the area for dinner. My fave is the black sesame creme brûlée (actually I haven't tried anything else because I love this dessert so much!). And for tea, I usually get the genmai tea. Its hard to get a seat on a busy night, but if you don't mind waiting for a bit, its worth it. Better for smaller groups though!
Michelle X.}New York, NY}95}6}18}-1}4}4/17/2016}One of the most popular dessert spots in East Village. Always a long wait on weekends.If one is looking for real Japanese matcha experience , definitely get the Hot Green Tea Latte with red bean paste. This is one of the very few places in NYC that have it. Although most people like to get the iced ones, actually the hot one is more authentic, close to what I had in Japan (Traditional Japanese Cha-Dou). Be mindful that it will be pretty bitter, but with a strong refreshing tea scent. The sweetness of red bean paste perfectly balances the bitterness. It will be a joyful experience for tea lovers. I like the desserts here too, although most desserts with green tea ice cream taste similar, I usually only get one dish with ice cream. Service here is decent, except for they tend to push customers to check and leave right after finishing the food. Which I don't blame them, cuz there are always many people waiting in line.
Cheryl P.}Chula Vista, CA}842}189}570}18}5}4/16/2016}This place was packed when we got here around 10, we were told it would be a 30 min wait, came back in 30 and they told us everyone else would be waiting another 20 or 30 mins and there was a line down the stairs. Once we finally were seated after they gave us a call to come back, everything tasted great. We were not disappointed. Definetly be prepared to wait and walk around a bit but this place is worth it!
Waffle M.}Berkeley, CA}5}9}70}-1}1}4/11/2016}Bad customer service I've ever had!!! My friends and I were annoyed by the waiter. We went to Cha An on a Sunday afternoon for food and dessert, not so many customers in the room. Immediately after we finished the set, the waiter directly gave us checks without asking if we wanted dessert. Then we called him back to add dessert. We chatted after the dessert, but he seemed to chase us out. We were so annoyed since no customers were waiting outside for tables. We expected good food and pleasant time, but the customer service was so bad. We decide not to come again because in NYC there are sooooooo many much better Japanese restaurants/tea rooms, especially in East Village.
Sarah A.}Valley Stream, NY}6}39}19}-1}3}4/9/2016}A cute tea spot that my boyfriend and I decided to get dessert at after dinner. We came here because of the reviews on Yelp.The decor is really pretty. They have this bamboo aesthetic thing going on even though the place is tiny and it is on the second floor above a club (which was open because this was a Friday night). I got the black sesame creme brûlée which was FANTASTIC. My boyfriend got one of the red bean desserts but preferred mine. The downside is that the teas are WAY too expensive for the amount they give you. My bf got a teapot that literally only gave him ONE cup of green tea and it was 7 bucks. (Wtf???) I got the Crimson chai and it was ok. Also we came in around 10:30pm and the place closes at midnight. As soon as we got our food the waitress slapped the check down on the table. At first I was like ok...then she came back a minute later and was like I need you to pay now cuz we're closing the register. I guess they were just rushing because they were about to close but usually you could just wait for us to finish eating since it was nowhere near 12.... Verdict: black sesame creme brûlée. Get it. And get out. Probably would come back during the day to try the meals but the tea is overpriced.
Sierra X.}New York, NY}20}65}2268}-1}3}4/6/2016}The service here is horrendous. It's incredibly slow to the point that we were annoyed. It took forever for everything and really wasted our time. We were one of the first customers in because we came in right when they opened. We got the dessert sampler. The best thing on it was the black sesame creme brûlée. It was amazing. Very smooth and creamy, and great sesame flavor. We enjoyed everything on the sampler except the mochi. Overall, the desserts were pretty good but the service is terrible.
Charlie C.}Irvine, CA}3}5}3}-1}4}4/5/2016}I had the unagi kabayaki for lunch, then dessert plate and sakura flan for dessert. The unagi kabayaki was really good, no heavy fishy smell or taste at all, the portion was perfect for lunch. Desserts taste just like what you'd have in Japan, especially it is hard to find the traditional Japanese dessert in NYC. It's slightly pricy if you live on a budget($20 for the dessert plate), but worth trying.
Ms F.}Midtown West, Manhattan, NY}0}24}3}-1}4}4/3/2016}Always enjoy coming back here. Food is on the smaller size portion, but very good on the stomach. One of my favorite tea houses with food!
Nathaniel P.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}39}50}24}-1}4}4/2/2016}Cute little tea-shop/ restaurant in the east village. Between the kindness and hospitality of the waitress and the decor and ambiance I felt like I was back in Kyoto. Came in here and got a lunch special tuna which was served over a bed of brown rice. It was super good and fresh and was served with green tea. The whole meal felt relaxed and was a strong juxtaposition to the hustle and bustle of the city just down the stairs. The waitress was so sweet and kept bringing over tea whenever she noticed I was running low. Next time I come I definitely want to try some different teas-- they looked/ smelled so good!
Joanne H.}Saint Louis, MO}100}143}569}18}5}3/30/2016}Love this place. Located in a hip neighborhood with Japanese cuisine galore this is a great afternoon tea/ dessert spot :) The desserts have the authentic sweet qualities of Japanese sweets and very kind service. Also clean amenities which are always a plus!
Jay I.}New York, NY}238}666}157}18}4}3/29/2016}came for some dessert on a weekday night.  I was initially told to wait for about 20-30 minutes, but I was seated about 10 minutes after putting my name down.  This place seems to be always busy, so the restaurant itself was very vibrant with conversations everywhere. We ordered the sesame creme brulee and flan, along with chai ice tea and hojicha.  We thought the creme brulee was very rich and delicious, and the flan was well made too.  Hojicha was pretty good too.  Not a bad option for tea/dessert after dinner around the area (fyi, they also serve dinner meal).
Shirley Y.}Seattle, WA}92}52}118}-1}5}3/29/2016}Ice cream sandwich 綠茶脆脆9.5/10 Ice cream is frozen little bit so not really good, but first try the layer is crispy wAfers which I feel chill. Actually it is difficult to cut the wafers, so spends time to eat lol 雪糕有點太溶化，但脆脆第一次試綠茶味夠，但好難切，食得要有技巧Cremebrulee Black sesame ice cream with waferThere are some jelly included .i dunno how to describe but it is really yummy and feel satisfied.黑芝麻雪糕加上啫喱加上芝麻脆脆，不知怎樣形容，好好味。Finally, forgot the last name of the right side ice creamBut remember there is Carmel source with sweet dumpling and green tea jelly. 外表是焦糖醬加上湯丸啫喱。This is so so because I tried it when I was in Hong Kong 普通因為在香港的京林屋吃過。#greentea#foodexplorer#foodtravelers#foodblogger#foodie#綠茶控#foodofthday#相機食先
Casey C.}Kansas City, MO}0}9}3}-1}5}3/27/2016}Loved the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and the Green Tea Parfait. The black sesame ice cream and accompanying cookie crisp were amazing. I love that the desserts were not sugar laden.
Niku L.}Kalihi, Honolulu, HI}22}252}2002}-1}4}3/27/2016}Sweet and chill. Two words to describe this wonderfully tucked away slice of heaven in the East Village.  Cha An is a Japanese eatery known for its desserts and relaxing atmosphere of wood, branches, and traditional Japanese screens. They also serve lunch specials, but I only had the honour of trying their desserts and tea service.Cha An's signage is slightly sedate so you have to be on the look out for it. However, once you get in, it's like a whole different world.  My friends and I came right when they opened at 2 pm so we wouldn't have to wait.  One of my friends had already been there and he wanted to take us there to experience it.  What a wonderful choice.  We were seated relatively promptly and that's when my dilemma occurred-- every dessert looked and sounded so delicious!  I have a major sweet tooth so I wanted everything on that menu.  In the end, my friends both ordered their black sesame crème brûlée with black sesame ice cream and a black sesame wafer on top while I ordered the hojicha (a type of tea) ice cream with amitsu.  And of course, I also had to be bad and order a second dessert, the ice cream sandwich with green tea rice crispy wafers as the 'bread' of the sandwich.  Everything was sublime-- nothing was overpoweringly sweet and the presentation was immaculate. My only criticism would be with the ice cream sandwich wafers which were too hard to cut into and they were a little too stiff when biting into them. If it was more soft like a traditional rice crispy, it would be perfect.All the ice creams of hojicha, green tea, and black sesame had strong profiles-- you could taste the tea or the black sesame.  My favourite dessert in the end was the black sesame once because of that burnt wafer which complemented the sweet cream and ice cream well since the wafer was slightly bitter.To make sure you don't have too much of a sugary aftertaste, I would recommend the silver needle tea that we ordered-- a light but strong tea that was able to balance out the sugary confections.  Service was polite and efficient and they got our orders out promptly. They were really nice at explaining each dessert and they refilled our tea constantly, though we did have to ask them to do that.  Anyhow, on my next trip to NY, I will definitely return here to try some more yummy parfaits and I hope you will too.
Cindy M.}Brooklyn, NY}115}26}123}-1}4}3/26/2016}After a hefty ramen meal at a restaurant that didn't serve tea, my foodie partner and I were hankering for some tea. We were already stuffed so we just ordered two pots of tea. I'm sort of a purist when it comes to tea so I like how their selection is very simple (i don't have to worry about random filler stuff like licorice, coconut, florals, etc. in my tea that makes the flavor strange to my palate). The first tea we had was the Honey Phoenix (Oolong Tea); this had a very smooth fragrant and naturally sweet taste. The Kangen water that they use to brew the tea is so good and I can definitely taste the difference. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd go out and buy a filter for myself to use at home. The second tea we had was the Keemun Mao Feng (Black Tea). This was even more fragrant and had a stronger and dryer taste to it. I would've preferred adding some honey and milk to this one to balance out the taste. Still good, but I preferred the other one better. I'll definitely be back to try out their other teas and food items. I liked how the environment was so zen--quiet, simple, and comforting like how what you would expect from a Japanese teahouse.
Anne P.}Manhattan, NY}63}8}11}-1}5}3/21/2016}My group of 3 came by here after dinner and we were put on the wait list of about 40 mins. It seemed worth it because there was a line down the stairs and we were hoping for cute seating near the entrance. We ended up being seated there by chance and loved the ambience! We ordered the homemade Mochi and ice cream sandwich and the 3 teas that we each ordered came with a pot for each of us so we could share and pour for ourselves. There was this one fancy tea that my friend ordered (called Tieguanyin) and the waiter also showed us how to pour it (it was so complicated, fun to watch but we ended up just pouring it like normal people). There was some serious partying going on at a bar nearby, which is to be expected as it was a Friday night, so we could literally feel the bass of the music shaking our seats, haha. But it was ok because this place had relaxing music to (sort of) cover it up. Also, their bathroom is super clean and has a bidet if you're into that stuff...
Eggyolk H.}Corona, NY}31}99}109}-1}1}3/16/2016}I have been waiting to try this place for the longest time and thus will be my first and last time here. 4 Star for decors it gives you an away from the city setting 1 star for service - They made us wait when there were seat available. tea was not hot enough and no hot water refill. 3 star for taste - had better2 star for price - not worth itTips don't order the tea, You can make better at home. Try the desert if thats what you crave. Don't come unless you happen to be in the area.
X F.}Irvine, CA}0}18}2}-1}5}3/14/2016}Authentic, delicious, nice decoration & friendly staff. The only downside is that this spot is not big so there could be a long wait.
Michelle L.}Quincy, MA}131}38}11}-1}5}3/14/2016}My friend and I tried the Chef's Dessert Sampler, which included small versions of the black sesame creme brulee, green tea roll cake, tea-flavored ice cream with a sweet sesame brittle, chocolate cookies, and a sakura dessert. Everything is presented beautifully in Japanese pottery and with bamboo-themed accessories. All of which were delicious with the tea. The prices are on the higher end, so it's nice place to treat yourself once in awhile. My Japanese friend said everything tasted pretty authentic and traditional. Everything tastes wonderful, and the service was nice, but the space was a bit small. I would definitely come again.
Kenneth Y.}New York, NY}342}97}172}-1}4}3/12/2016}A really nice place : 4.5/5 stars. The space is really nicely decorated, and the service is good. The price is just a little bit extravagant. [FOOD]Unagi Kabayaki (Lunch Special): This was really good. The eel was cooked nicely, and the sauce wasn't too strong. The rice was very nice too. The sides were pretty small and not too great. We also got the additional mini dessert for $3 extra. It was a green tea pudding, but the consistency was more like that of mousse. It was light and had a nice subtle green tea taste. The tea was good too; it was like a matcha/jasmine mixture.Dessert Sampler: To be honest, I think it would have been better to get a single dessert than the sampler. It's not that the mini desserts were bad, it's just that they weren't really much my preference. It included two cookies (matcha and chocolate), green tea cake, green tea ice cream with a sesame cookie, sticky rice ball with red bean filling, and sesame creme brulee. The cookies were okay, nothing special. The cake was a little dry for me, but my friend liked t. The ice cream was my favorite; it only had a slight green tea taste and was very refreshing. The rice ball was good too, but for me it's not a unique dessert. The creme brulee tasted only of sesame, which isn't bad, but I really like the custard flavor. It was nice to taste all these desserts though.[OVERALL]There's also a HUGE selection of teas. I'd love to come back to try the other desserts and various teas. It's a shame they're so expensive.
Trinh And Laurie L.}Brooklyn, NY}46}127}216}-1}3}3/12/2016}As a tea parlor the place is wonderful, but as a restaurant this could be better. There are only few limited options in the menu for dinner. The selection desserts from the chef for $20 is a great deal to enjoy some great treats. Would definitely recommend the place for a tea time and desserts.
Winnie M.}New York, NY}288}19}191}-1}4}3/11/2016}Super cute dessert place with lots of different teas and desserts. It is associated with soba-ya across the street. I ordered the black sesame creme brûlée and it was delicious! If you like black sesame this is the dessert for you because the sesame taste is STRONG. It came with a sesame cracker garnish on top & I was not a fan. It was burnt and tasted like burnt popcorn kernel. Other than that, the staff is friendly and the presentation of this place is very relaxing and put together.
Fiona D.}New York, NY}170}131}313}-1}5}3/4/2016}I LOVE CHA-AN so much! It has such a homey feel to it. I admit the place is very small and cramped, but I never mind waiting for a spot to open up. Cha-an has both desserts and savory foods but everyone comes here just for the desserts, I mean at least I do. The desserts can be quite pricey (starting price is around $8), especially for the size of most of these, but BOY ARE THEY DELICIOUS! I have made it a goal to sample every single dessert they have here, and so far I've tried two of their mochi desserts, both of their parfaits, and the black sesame ice cream.I have to say that my all time favorite dessert is the green tea parfait. It is a flavorful pack bite with every spoon, not only that they have different texture of ingredients mixed in the parfait itself which makes it very interesting. Most of their desserts involve matcha flavored things, but if you're not a fan of that, you should definitely try the black sesame ice cream (which is my second favorite!) I also love trying their teas. Most of the teas are very affordable. They range from $6 to $10 for a pot of tea; most of the time, you can share the pot of tea with at least 3 people. Their teas are so fragrant and unique, nothing that you can get at your local tea store. Also they are very attentive on how they make their teas, making sure that the water is at the perfect temperature and the leaves are seeped for a specific amount of time. My favorite tea when I go there is the mint lavender (I might have the name wrong but I think that's what it's called). It not only smells good but it tastes delicious after you chow down your dessert as well. Definitely a palette cleanser hehe. The staff here is generally nice. They're usually very busy at Cha-an so they won't take the time out to ask you how you're doing and if you're enjoying your food, but they try their best. pretty much all of them are friendly and I've never had a problem with customer service after countless times of coming here. So if you're around the St. Marks area, make sure to hit up Cha-an!! It's a perfect place for a date, a girl's get-together  or any other occasion!
Tiffany C.}Toronto, Canada}6}5}8}-1}5}3/2/2016}Gourmet trip with my BFF in NYC!! Omg this place is AMAZING!! Very authentic Japanese style desserts I'll definitely come back for more!
Alice L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}191}905}-1}4}2/29/2016}Located on E9th, this was a hidden gem. I came for their desserts after my dinner. They are affiliated with soba-ya.This is a tea house so they have all sorts of tea flavors. They also have savory food ranging from toasts to smoked salmon dishes. Their sweet desserts are pretty good here. The ambiance is casual. The lighting is dim and with subtle decorations.My friends and I ordered the Black sesame creme brulee, the ice Cream Sandwich, Green tea parfait and a cold matcha drink. Aside from the black sesame creme brulee, everything was green. The presentation for each dessert was done nicely. It was clean and looked appetizing. I had the green tea parfait. it came with these plain white mochi. It wasn't to my liking. It was extremely bland. Other than that, it was quite good. The green tea flavorful was definitely there throughout the entire dish. The black sesame creme brulee and ice cream sandwich came with this black sesame garnish on top. It was not to any of our liking. It tasted heavily burnt and bitter.
Joey R.}Brooklyn, NY}91}118}523}18}4}2/29/2016}Been here a few times with my friends and it's a great place to go for a little dessert. Had the salmon toast, that was my favorite. The first time I went I had the icecream set. It was good however the portion was alittle small. But overall a cute neat place to go for dessert!
Alyssa D.}New Milford, NJ}149}127}414}18}5}2/27/2016}This place is a hidden gem. It's a cute little cozy cafe that is perfect for a date!Came here for dessert only and everything looked delicious so I got the dessert sampler. For $20 I would say it's pretty decently priced. Everything tasted delicious ! Very tasty desserts and I am the queen. I would definitely come back to try their meals since our neighbors got sets and they looks beautifully delicious. Most definitely will be back
Yannie H.}New York, NY}13}106}68}18}4}2/24/2016}Desserts are delicious and pricey but it's worth it. It's cash only so remember to bring cash! The flan and the sesame creme brûlée is my favorite
Andrea K.}Manhattan, NY}45}7}0}-1}1}2/21/2016}Do not believe the hours that they have publicized on the site.   The workers and management do not care about the customers as we tried to rationalize with them.   If we arrive specifically to have desert here,  from the ues at 11:25pm and your own website says that you are to serve until midnight,  you are to honor that.  Don't look me in the eye and tell me that the kitchen decided the close earlier and that no manager is available.   Spend your money at an establishment that cares about your business.
L. Hook V.}Stamford, CT}2}70}94}-1}3}2/20/2016}While Cha An is more than just desserts this post is just about the teas and dessert.  Located on the 2nd floor in the Noho/East Village (?) area, Cha An is moderate in size, good spacing between tables and comfortable. This isn't your normal dessert place but rather a quite serious tea house with a modest selection of good to very good desserts.  Our group got three teas (all diverse and excellent) and 4 different desserts (ranging from good, to very good).  The sampler had the green tea roll cake (goodish, nothing better) black sesame brûlée (good), two small cookies (nothing special), an odd red been paste inside an almost mochi type wrapper (jury out on this, wife disliked while I actually found it interesting and tasty, in an odd way) and an ice cream (I think sesame) with a sesame crisp (ice cream good, crisp stupendous).  A chocolate soufflé with raspberry coulis was very good but a tad too well done.  The black sesame creme brûlée and a green tea Matcha that I thought was very good.  Service was ok once we ordered (took a while to order) and pleasant.  All in all a good spot for well executed Asian desserts, just not a place we will run back to.  I guess it wasn't our cup of tea...
Jenny K.}Manhattan, NY}0}98}57}-1}4}2/20/2016}Their tea is amazing. I got the Scarlet something tea which was exactly what I needed on a cold evening. I had their black sesame creme brulee before too which was delicious. I'd definitely go back! The service is alright.. They suck at estimating the parties so they often ask people to move to make room for a bigger party which is annoying. It used to be cash only but now they also take card which is nice. There's always a wait though so be prepared!
Wen Q.}Manhattan, NY}78}10}5}-1}4}2/19/2016}Deserts are superb!     A little loud for tea.. Pumpkin Pudding was my favourite.
Yiwen Z.}Honolulu, HI}160}224}604}18}3}2/17/2016}first I have to say this is a nice place for dessert and date!!!!  then why I gave it three star is because it's not a good place for tea and enjoying tea or have a zen moment or reading! which is what I had in mind when I saw this place and the interior decor.it is very crowded, and full of people chatting. I'm a bit disappointed cause it looks like such a good tea house, yet in reality it's more like spot dessert bar...     but after all the desserts are nice.
Morgan J.}Washington, DC}437}24}16}-1}5}2/14/2016}Came here the day before Valentines Day with my wife for her birthday and had two hot matcha lattes, the salmon toast, Creme brûlée and a soba beer. Everything was quite good and light on the stomach. It was really packed that day, but they let me sit at the bar. If you've never been here before, the place is small, but having travelled to Japan several time before, it definitely fits the lack of space motif. The cooks and servers are Japanese so you can't beat the authenticity there. They have about 20 different kinds of tea, but matcha is the popular way to go. You can show off that piece of Japanese knowledge to your friends when you take them here.
Alon X.}Austin, TX}5}305}7}-1}2}2/13/2016}Got the jasmine flower tea which expands in the pot. This place is way overpriced.I didn't enjoy anything from the sampler desert platter. And those are the most popular.  I won't be back. Also 40 min wait for this??!
Riku O.}Bronx, NY}0}19}0}-1}4}2/11/2016}Authentic Japanese food and sweets. It'd be even better if the price was just a little cheaper because the food portion isn't really enough, but overall, great place to get Japanese food in the city!
Andrea C.}New York, NY}165}113}208}18}4}2/9/2016}I really liked this place! The wait was horrible on a Friday night at 9:30pm..We had to wait 35-40 minutes for a table. The desserts were amazing though. We ordered the Black Sesame Créme Brulée, Ice Cream Sandwich, and the Green Tea Parfait. My favorite was the parfait. You can taste the raw bitterness of matcha in the GT ice cream. The ice cream sandwich had two layers of green tea rice crackers but it was hard to break it apart. I literally had to slam my fork down to break it. The brûlée was delicious and fluffy and I loved the taste.
Winnie N.}Brooklyn, NY}1}31}1}-1}4}2/8/2016}A hearty and warm meal during the winter time can truly lift the soul! Their dinner sets have a good variety of salty, sour and sweet side dishes (radishes, house veggies, anchovies). My party of four each ordered dinner sets and we enjoyed the rice porridge meals the most.Service was attentive and pleasant. A nice and quiet place, good for conversations without screaming at the person sitting next to you. Overall, enjoyable and will be coming back.
Sophia S.}Cambridge, MA}0}6}2}-1}4}2/6/2016}The decor of this place is so beautiful! It's designed to look like a Japanese garden/house. My friend and I split their tuna tataki lunch which was pretty good. Nothing super special, but well made and tasted good. We also split two desserts -- the ice cream sandwich and the seasonal flan. I believe the flan was red bean flavored? But it was incredibly creamy and delicious! The ice cream sandwich was also very creative and beautiful. It comes with two match rice crackers, matcha whipped cream, and ice cream! It was delicious and my favorite between the two! An adorable place I would definitely come back to!
Amy L.}Brooklyn, NY}31}177}232}18}4}2/5/2016}Been dying to come here for month after browsing through all the cute Yelp photos of the food and ambience. Finally got the chance to after eating across the street at soba ya tonight (haha). From what I hear, the line is usually long here and sometimes even extends up the stairs, but at 7:30pm on a Friday night this place wasn't too packed. Came here in a party of 3 and was seated around 7 minutes upon arrival. The seating is so atmospheric and cozy; the culture really resonates throughout the restaurant. I thought Cha-An mostly served tea and pastries, but I was excited to see all the different dessert options they had. Green tea seems to be a special entity here, so if you're a green tea/matcha lover like I am, this is your spot! I didn't order anything from the many different types of matcha drinks, but I know what I'll be doing the next time I come here, hehe. I got the hojicha anmitsu, which was a small bowl of green tea jelly, green tea ice cream, red bean, some sweet yellow thing I don't recall, and some dough balls. I was surprised at how different green tea jelly tasted from what I had expected; it was far more bitter than I liked, but only left me wanting more. The green tea ice cream was indescribable; it's rare for me to find "authentic" green tea ice cream, and I think I found it here tonight. It was sweet and extra creamy, with a strong yet delicious after- taste. The dough balls reminded me of the ones my mother makes during the Chinese holidays, which added to the combination of deliciousness and nostalgia. My friends ordered the 3-set mochi: black sesame, green tea, and red bean, and a black sesame creme brûlée. I didn't have much of either dessert, but one bite was enough to satisfy my curiosity. Somehow the desserts just seem to carry a strong flavor and the chefs get to your taste buds just right.Would love to come back and try the salmon toast. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a small restaurant to just chat, drink tea, and eat fine dessert with friends :)
Caroline J.}Los Angeles, CA}243}90}595}-1}5}2/5/2016}If you love matcha then you must come to have dessert here. Everything on the menu is so delicious. We went around 9pm at night and don't need to wait. Love the matcha latte. Haven't try the main dishes yet but will try next time when I'm in NYC.
June H.}New York, NY}104}64}922}18}5}2/1/2016}I am being a huge fan of Cha-An !! Especially their desserts are soooo good.Black sesame crime brûlée is my favorite. Chestnut pudding is also has unique flavor. Mochi with green tea ice cream is a bit normal. And try their green tea latte ! I just love them. Wish I could live near this cute japanese style restaurant.
Vicky L.}Seattle, WA}10}498}8}-1}4}1/28/2016}The tuna tataki was a little bit salty, which I find rare in Japanese restaurant. But the sesame ice cream with brûlée is absolutely AMAZING! It was so strong and different from any sesame ice cream I ever have had.
Misschi I.}New York, NY}29}8}1}-1}4}1/25/2016}Always love traditional Japanese cuisines and matcha dessert is a must-try whenever I see them.  Been to Cha-an few times bringing different friends each time. So far I didn't disappoint anyone with my recommendation. Everyone left with satisfaction and wanted to come back for more! I like all the dishes I have tried so far. Although some of the matcha dessert drinks are a bit too sweet for me but at least still have strong match flavor where I enjoyed.They don't take reservation so sometimes it's a bit of pain to wait as it is always crowded, otherwise I will probably go every week!
Stacey B.}Bakersfield, CA}0}12}0}-1}1}1/24/2016}The waiter is not very accommodating.  Wanted to put an extra chair to my table he started yelling at us for no reason.  First time being here but definitely not coming back.
Samuel M.}Manhattan, NY}64}404}44}-1}4}1/23/2016}The perfect lunch. They serve you the exact amount of nutrients that you need. The location is charming, an East Village second floor in a street with other cool Japanese restaurants like Robataya.    The menu is simple, you choose one of the trays. A small portion of chicken, rice, salmon, soup and carb included. Hearty food.  It is Japanese tea house with fine quality teas.   The space is small, the customers are girls in the majority. The girl next to us was speaking very loud. Obnoxious.     Cozy and authentic, with yummy bread. It's strange in a Japanese to have bread. The bar is pretty. Lovely.
Becka C.}Houston, TX}396}161}234}-1}4}1/21/2016}This is a great spot for a girls night or date night! Super cute atmosphere and very friendly servers. My friends and I ordered the dessert sampler, green tea parfait and black sesame creme brulee. Everything was delicious and not overly sweet. My personal favorite of the night was the black seseame creme brulee! The black sesame flavor was really prevalent and I loved that. The dessert sampler was good, but nothing was that memorable. Same for the green tea parfait, but I still enjoyed everything we got.
Laura Y.}New York, NY}6}76}17}-1}4}1/19/2016}This place has got a banging toilet. Those Japanese toilets are truly a fine piece of engineering and design. Oh..and the food was good too!My friend and I had the smoked salmon toast as well as the chef's dessert platter. Both were very flavorful, fresh and beautifully presented. The star of the show was the sesame creme brulee. I'm a sucker for seasame so this was right up my alley. I only wish that I could've had a whole bowl of it. Yum!
Alice H.}Kearny, NJ}0}1}3}-1}3}1/17/2016}Decoration of the store is amazingly beautiful! However, the desert wasn't that good.
Snoopy C.}Torrance, CA}3}139}39}-1}4}1/15/2016}Cute Japanese dessert snack place. I have been there about three times now. Everything I tried had been really good and tasty. Desserts are not too sweet.
Victoria X.}New York, NY}507}539}344}18}3}1/14/2016}If it is crowded, you can leave your name and wander st.marks until your table is ready; they will call you when its ready. The interior of the restaurant is very traditional and small, so I definitely would not recommend coming here with a group of more than 4 people, especially during prime hours (where they've stated that if it is super busy they can put a time limit on your dining experience). I finally got a chance to try this place after having it bookmarked for so long and here is my take on it:1. The tea is good, they will refill the pot with water whenever you need a refill but flagging down a waitress and having the pot returned to you takes a while. 2. The salmon toast was good, but not amazing. It reminds me a savory version of the ever popular honey bread you can get in most Korean cafes. 3. The trio mochi (black sesame, green tea, earl grey chocolate) was good at most. The black sesame is definitely my favorite, followed by green tea. The earl grey chocolate was just too sweet for my liking.
James W.}Los Angeles, CA}2691}1908}8141}-1}4}1/14/2016}I randomly found this place because we were dining nearby and wanted emergency dessert. As it was a cold day outside, a tea house sounded perfect. I almost went into the lounge next door, but look for the staircase next to it that takes you to the second floor. Upstairs, there is a tastefully decorated Japanese enclave with a little sushi bar area and a bunch of intimate tables. I think it's a hidden gem, but based on the number of reviews for this place, maybe not?In any case, they have an extensive tea menu, which includes less traditional items like green tea latte and such. However, they also have an extensive food menu with a great dessert selection that are pretty unique.1. Hot matcha latte with red bean: Loved that this came in a bowl. Be cultured and don't ask for a spoon. Pick up the bowl and drink. The red beans at the bottom...maybe ask for the spoon after all. Who knows. In any case, it was a sweet drink, but not too sweet. I liked that it was a hot drink on a cold day!2. Mochi mochi: It's a little mound of 3 different types of mochi of varying flavors. There was a sesame one, but I honestly couldn't tell you what the other flavors were. It all tasted pretty organic-y. I wasn't a fan of one of them.3. Chef's dessert platter: You have to try this because it includes the black sesame creme brulee. I thought it was good, but the flavors are really hit-you-over-the-head. There was also an ice cream one, and a bunch of other small plates that I couldn't exactly figure out the contents. In any case, it was all pretty good, but some with flavors that are unique and you may not enjoy as much.Overall, very cute place for tea and dessert. Many things are good, a few things may be weird to the taste. Give it a try!
Victoria M.}New York, NY}2}88}74}-1}3}1/12/2016}The black sesame crème brûlée is very creative and the filling is really smooth, but honestly the black sesame flavor for crème brûlée is a little strange for me. My partner likes it. The mochis are alright. The chocolate flavor is weird though, for it has a hint of tea flavor--strange mixture. The price is a little high, 21 for only two desserts before tips.The decoration is very Japanese and the environment really good. But the waitress is a little picky and asked us to take the water bottle off the table (we were just putting the bottle on the table and did not even touch it). And another waitress even accidentally took my phone away in the menu.Overall speaking, will not come back as the desserts, the price and the service combined is not attractive.
Alek K.}Washington, DC}0}13}0}-1}4}1/9/2016}Came here because of the reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed. At 2 pm on a Saturday the place was full and stayed that way when we left an hour later, but only a 5 minute wait.The decor is very cozy and in great taste - rustic Japanese style.The food is simple, but savory and very well presented. The deserts are very elegant and tasty.Definitely deserves its rating.
Helen S.}Cleveland, OH}382}323}1500}18}5}1/8/2016}The next time you come, don't be surprised if you find me crouching behind a bamboo screen cradling a cup of tea and nibbling other people's scraps. I would live here, truly I would. When our trio arrived, all the tables were taken but we were offered seats at the tea "bar" if we felt comfortable sitting there. Why not? And so we found ourselves with front row seating to a most interesting show of tea craft and muted Japanese banter between the employees. All the staff were incredibly hospitable, but service was a bit slow since it was a holiday weekend. However, we found it a refreshing place to slow down and relax within the bustling city.We ordered several snacks and three teas to share, and the sharing part would definitely have been easier at a booth or real table. The Honey Phoenix Oolong Tea was our favorite - a tasty oolong with a delicate sweetness to it. The White Peony was a little lacking, and boy oh boy was that cup of Matcha strong! The first two teas came in teapots while the Matcha arrived in a wide ceramic bowl with a side of red beans and mochi. There's a few different variations of their Iced Green Tea Drink - we got the Premium one, which came with a scoop of green tea ice cream and red bean. A safe choice for those who don't want to get too crazy with their refreshments. Seaweed and Tofu salad arrived with two good-sized pieces of very soft tofu. Simple and tasty, but I would only get it if you feel like you owe your gut some vegetables. We didn't know what to expect from the Chestnut Flan, their seasonal flavor. We had no regrets - the flan is more pudding-like than cake-like, but the mellow, roasty chestnut flavor really shone through. The infamous Black Sesame Crème Brûlée met and exceeded our already high expectations. You get all sorts of textures in a bite - crunchy, crispy, creamy, crumbly, custardy - and all the flavors really work in harmony. Be glad this seems to be one of the permanent items on the menu. I have another confession: I have a bathroom crush on Cha-An's toilette. The sliding screen door to the women's restroom blends almost seamlessly with the rest of the decor, and this is few times I've ever referred to a bathroom as cozy. "Zen" might be too cliché of a term to use, but it could have been designed for a zen-themed spa room. The giant Japanese smart-toilet somehow jives with the earthy vibes, calming lighting, and potted plant in the corner. It is possible to find privacy and comfort in public, people.
Irene G.}New Hyde Park, NY}22}182}139}18}5}1/7/2016}I love this place. The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday night. It's located upstairs and the location gets you away from the busy city. It is a small place but it was cozy and you didn't feel like you were ease dropping on other people's conversation. I had the jasmine green tea and the green tea parfait. the tea comes in a pot shareable for two. the parfait was amazing. You can definitely taste the green tea in the ice cream. The food menu looked good too. Something I want to try out
Kristy M.}New York, NY}3}8}8}-1}5}1/6/2016}Exactly like the photos in the menu. Other than the process being insanely high for small amounts, I think it was a good experience. My friends and I ordered the Sampler plate and Mochi Mochi! Very asian flavored which I love. The Mochi Mochi was definitely my favorite. All the flavored there agreed with my taste buds. It was different and unexpected. I enjoyed my experience. Not sure I would come again due to the prices but otherwise, it was a great experience.
Karen C.}New York, NY}1}6}0}-1}4}1/4/2016}I love going to Cha An and I always recommend this to my out of town friends when they come to NYC for a visit.  Cha An reminds me of the Japanese green tea houses in Kyoto.Their salmon toast is very yummy and great for a light lunch or snack.  Other food and desserts are so unique and not to be found in other places.  I am bummed that they no longer sell their delicious macarons or the shortbread.
S. M.}Manhattan, NY}1}27}0}-1}3}1/4/2016}The dessert sampler alone gets 5 stars from me. The tea is also very good. Unfortunately, the rest of the menu doesn't meet the same standard. The thick egg toast was too heavy, the yukimi zenzai was too sweet, and the kayu was way overpriced.
Zishan C.}Plainsboro Township, NJ}0}34}50}-1}5}1/4/2016}Great dessert and delicate appetizers. The waiter was nice and patient. I strongly recommend the black sesame ice cream and seasonal flan
Nobel V.}Nutley, NJ}929}311}1301}18}4}1/4/2016}Once you find this place, go up the flight of stairs, sit down, and relax with some tea and desserts.  With the ambiance inside, it can create an intimate atmosphere so this is a nice place to bring a date.  Cha-An provides a nice variety of teas to choose from depending on how you are feeling and your preference.  If you are actually not feeling for tea, they also have a nice menu of desserts.  One of my favorite desserts here is the Black Sesame Créme Brulée.  If you are a fan of black sesame flavor, you'll enjoy this. It is even topped with sesame ice cream and a sesame cookie.  It is sesame overload!  I would also enjoy getting the Matcha Latte here as they add red bean in it for a nice touch.  One thing I remember having here was Cherry Blossom Flan, which was their seasonal flan at the time.  It was definitely very interesting and for some reason I could not pinpoint the taste.  It tasted plain, but yet, it was not bad to have.  Like I said, I was confused by my tastebads with this flan haha.Just as a note, they do have a limited menu of food here, but I have never eaten a meal here so I cannot access the food.  Maybe I'll come back to try the food sometime!
W L.}Manhattan, NY}1}69}6}-1}5}1/1/2016}I love Cha-An. It has such a special place in my heart... This place is so cozy and friendly that I often feel very comfortable having a meal here by myself. I've been a loyal customer since 2012. If you know how to appreciate a healthy Japanese meal that focuses on the food's natural flavors, then this place is totally worth trying! Don't come here if you are someone who likes to add BBQ sauce/soy sauce/vinegar to your food. They also have a variety of teas. Their dessert is always on point. Always.
Reviewer R.}Mineola, NY}2}49}8}-1}4}12/31/2015}The sesame creme brulee and chocolate souffle is delicious! I mostly get the dessert sampler and everything in it tastes yum! The grilled salmon toast is just as great.
Yangyang W.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}2}-1}4}12/30/2015}Nice matcha! Good place to enjoy afternoon tea! The Japanese dessert plate is very delicious! Love the rice inside that plate
Albert W.}Brooklyn, NY}193}921}535}18}4}12/30/2015}Fancy, delicious tea and dessert here.  Great Service.Each teapot is unique though somewhat annoying to have it refilled after just one cup as that's all it holds.  Also a bummer the men's room isn't as nice as the women's (with a fancy bidet).
Kimberly L.}San Francisco, CA}766}819}782}18}4}12/29/2015}The sesame creme brûlée is amazing!  I came here during the week and was happily surprised with how delicious the dessert was.  I also tried the green tea matcha.  The inside is nice/intimate and feels like you are in Asia.  The service was great and it's a nice spot to grab a sweet dessert after dinner.  It makes a nice quiet date spot too.  East 9th street offers a taste of Japan and Cha-An should not be missed.
Maggie T.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}30}98}9}-1}4}12/28/2015}We thought it was more of a restaurant, but they have more desserts. Everything was really good and we loved the decor. I love the hut inside the restaurant- I definitely felt transported! I didn't see many big tables, but did see a large group there, so I guess that if tables are free they can accommodate groups. I would love to go again!
Mimi Y.}Walnut, CA}1}24}42}-1}4}12/25/2015}The ambience is great! Desserts are okay, too sweet for me. The presentation of the desserts are nice. It's a great place to hang out after dinner, chit chat with friends!
Beryl N.}Springfield, VA}91}329}682}18}3}12/23/2015}Cute interior and suitable only for small groups since the restaurant is tiny. Enjoyed the variety of tea options. Pricey and portions are small. It's a very typical Japanese restaurant where they put more emphasis on dainty but beautiful presentation. Most people go for their desserts and teas. We ordered the unagi (eel) don, tekka (tuna) don, and a dessert sampler. Both the eel and tuna lunch was good but there's only 4 small pieces of fish in each dish. The dessert sampler is seasonal so you might not get the same desserts from my photo. Cozy place for a date night.
Ling Z.}Templetown, Philadelphia, PA}65}6}13}-1}4}12/19/2015}A nice place for a Jan style afternoon tea. Place is small but beautiful inside. Have a list of tea collection and dessert option.
Marie H.}Rochester, MN}225}111}380}-1}3}12/18/2015}I would probably give this place 4-stars for the food and service, but have to knock off a star for the price. I did love the interior decor (very traditional, even had some Japanese room dividers) and service was great. We all got the kago set so we could try everything - I really enjoyed the salmon salad and eel; the miso soup, seaweed/tofu salad, and desserts were decent but not amazing. Barely touched the rice. I think the 3 side dishes vary daily though so I might have enjoyed them more on a different day. Also I probably would have still been hungry had I not had a super late lunch.  All in all, not worth it for the $24+tax. Still a cute place to check out but be prepared to spend quite a bit (or don't get the kago set lol).
Desmond F.}New York, NY}57}91}54}-1}3}12/13/2015}The desserts and tea here are great (try the dessert sampler if it's your first time!), but the food is so-so and ridiculously overpriced. I dropped $24+tax on their Kago Set (other people have posted photos), which had good rice and miso soup, but nothing else was particularly tasty.The restaurant can also get a bit stuffy sometimes but it only happened once out of three visits, not sure if it's a regular thing. Service is consistently inattentive.
Wei T.}New York, NY}15}84}37}-1}4}12/9/2015}Really nice place!love almost everything here, especially the black sesame cream brûlée!  I'll come back again and again and again.....
Ron H.}Manhattan, NY}206}335}200}-1}3}12/8/2015}My Japanese friends came to visit, and I had always wanted to eat here, so I brought them here. We came about 40 minutes before closing, so I figured that'd be enough time for some tea and snacks. Yeah....maybe not. The service was a bit pushy. They notified us that they were closing soon, with a bit of an implied, if you don't think you're gonna eat fast, then maybe you should come back some other time. OK, that makes sense, restaurant staff work hard and want to go home like everyone else. But my friends pointed out that they mentioned it a lot throughout the service. The food was decent, but overall, I could live without a repeat visit.
Jung Joo K.}Great Neck, NY}454}101}263}18}5}12/8/2015}Be aware that some of the desserts you see in the photos on Yelp are not always available here at Cha-An. My friend and I wanted to try the matcha roll cake but it either wasn't in this season's menu or an out. Nonetheless, I had a great experience here. I had the matcha ice cream sandwich, smoked salmon toast and sesame creme brûlée. Each of them had a simple, balanced, and delicious taste. They weren't too sweet as desserts, or too savory as a snack. It was a little difficult to eat the ice cream sandwich--the matcha biscuits gave us quite a workout trying to break off each bite. I guess that made each bite all the more satisfying.. The wait can be a while. However, you're able to put your name and number on the list, take a stroll and return to the restaurant.
Stacy L.}New York, NY}40}90}24}-1}1}12/6/2015}Stopped by for dinner, and to start, service was not good, very slow! Couldn't flag down a waiter to get water. The menu selection is terrible, only 2 sets at $22 and $24 which is completely overpriced since its just porridge or rice, with a few small side dishes. Not authentic feeling or tasting at all. We also ordered the egg salad toast and the smoked salmon toast, $14 each. They were just okay, not my cup of tea. Only the dessert with the set was the highlight of the meal, pumpkin pudding. Set came with some sort of squash, chicken pieces, 2 slice of smoked salmon in salad, miso soup, and tofu with seaweed. Fail. Saw they had a lunch set meal of tuna tataki don and some other dish at $15 and that looked decent. Cha-an is best for just a snack or dessert meal, not dinner. Might as well have gone to Ootoya to get real Japanese homestyle cooking for less than $37 total.
Cana C.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}3}12/5/2015}Dessert is good.However, its tea is not as good as cha-an claimed to be. I've ordered a cup of white tea, Yinzhen, but it is brewed in a totally wrong way! They brew the tea by the traditional method. However, Yinzhen is a kind of tea that require a different way of brewing...the traditional method will only ruin the visual enjoyment of the tea...
Alex Y.}Alhambra, CA}105}43}16}-1}5}12/4/2015}A great place to hang out and catch up! I ordered the genmaicha as we just came from lunch. Friends ordered dessert which were excellent! A little slow on adding hot water but friendly staff. The wait is quite a bit but just walk around the area.
Jeannie K.}Houston, TX}218}515}427}18}3}12/1/2015}You feel like you've walked into a teahouse in some anime.  It's a place you'd take your parents for a leisurely conversation after dinner - cozy, classy. The desserts themselves were presented beautifully but for me lacked on the flavors.
Winnie L.}Brooklyn, NY}193}111}258}-1}5}11/29/2015}This place is amazing. I love the ambiance and the food is delicious. Tea is $5 if it's not part of your meal and I think it's worth it. It comes in a pot and it's good for two people. Their green tea is really rich, exactly how I like it. I don't remember what I ordered but I just remember it was really good. I wish I could try the other stuff on the menu but I never went back. Definitely would go back though and try the salmon toast and all the other good stuff. I would definitely recommend this place.
Kelly H.}FLUSHING, NY}106}10}18}-1}3}11/29/2015}Came here on a Saturday night for some after dinner dessert. Waited around 40 min for a table for three since the place is relatively small. We ordered the green tea parfait, handmade mochi (green tea, black sesame, and earl grey chocolate), and the black sesame creme brule. The desserts were delicious but nothing mind blowing, which I was expecting from the hype and price. Green tea parfait was yummy but nothing special. I would advise against getting the earl  grey chocolate mochi unless you're a fan of earl grey. It tasted a bit perfume-yy. The black sesame mochi was the most flavorful, in a good way. I did like the black sesame creme brule. It was light and delicious. The place is adorable for small groups. I would come back here to try the chef dessert sample plater.
Kate B.}Lawrenceville, GA}0}34}13}-1}4}11/28/2015}I had some tea with desserts here and was pleasantly surprised by how good their black sesame creme brulee was. My friend had the ice cream sandwich, which was a good choice also. The presentation is quite nice as well. Next time I come I'd like to try their other food menus.
Irene C.}Back Bay, Boston, MA}1}6}2}-1}1}11/25/2015}The food was ok. But the service is really bad. I already order the hot tea. I just want hot water when she refill the tea. But she does not give me hot water. And my lunch set comes with dessert, she ask me the dessert is choose between pudding and cake. And I just wondering which one to choose. Then she just left. And she chooses pudding for me......I have no idea with this server. Worst service in New York City
Nish S.}Birmingham, MI}145}161}2057}18}5}11/15/2015}I was walking down the street quite disappointed ftr trying the first dessert spot, and i came across this lil place. It reminded me of japan- the real japan! Was like being back in Kyoto. Wooden construction, simple, quite and clean. MUST CHECK OUT THE Rest rooms! We went for tge chef selection- heavenly!! Absolute heaven! Nice balance of sweet and sour. There were cookies, caramel brulee, brownie, sesame icecream- to name some. And matcha tra latte- must try!! In love!!!!!
Jean Claire G.}Queens, NY}760}408}1940}18}3}11/14/2015}Excited to try this place since I saw some of my friends posting pictures and it looks really good so finally find time to try it. Get here around 10pm & waited for 30 minutes for us to get seated. We ordered teas & 4 types of desserts, the hojicha anmitsu with (green tea ice cream, red bean, tea jelly & rice balls), seasonal flan, chesnut flavor & black sesame ice cream brule. We got smoked salmon too. Desserts & teas taste alright. Its not impressive & its pretty pricey. This place is good to try but not like a place to come back everytime.
Jenny T.}Brooklyn, NY}409}83}201}18}5}11/14/2015}Authentic, high quality, and delicious food!I ordered the Cha-An Set B for $24 which included one soup, two side dishes, tofu and seaweed salad, tea-smoked salmon, 15 grain rice, and a dessert.Although the portions were small, the amount was satisfying enough. Each bowl was full of rich flavors and textures.
George L.}Bronx, NY}178}96}144}-1}4}11/11/2015}A solid dessert spot which is right across from Soba-Ya. The sign can be easily missed but once you go upstairs to the actual place. The decor is very traditional in terms of it looking exactly like a Japanese tea house. Got seated quickly considering I came here on a Tuesday night and was I blown away by the variety of desserts they offered. I ended up settling on the Hojicha Anmitsu which was amazing while my girl got the Black Sesame Crème Brûlée.The Hojicha Anmitsu comes with a few mini mochies, green tea ice cream, red bean, chestnuts, and a foundation of hojicha jelly. The dessert was amazing as it added a variety of flavors that compliment each other extremely well. The dessert changed as I continue to eat it from a very subtle sweetness to an overwhelming one as the dessert dwindle down. I can say that it definitely took me on a journey. I completely devoured it in no time and sadly wish I had more considering it cost $9 for a small cup of it. The Black Sesame Crème Brûlée was topped with this solidify toasted black sesame piece of sugar. The Crème Brûlée was delicious but since it was not made from various components, it felt a bit lacking. However, the black sesame crusted sugar added a nice texture to it.This place is amazing for tea and japanese dessert lovers considering how hidden it is. I am already planning my next trip back.
Gui K.}Mountain View, CA}66}32}0}-1}5}11/8/2015}I had house made mochi and genmaicha tea. The mochi had flavors like green tea, chocolate and peanut, I think. It was pretty tasty. For the tea, they serve a cup and a teapot, which can be refilled.The atmosphere is good. Very cozy and the staff communicate in Japanese among themselves.It's on the pricier side, but nothing crazy.
Barry A.}Cherry Hill, NJ}6}85}40}-1}2}11/7/2015}Overpriced and overrated. The desserts are expensive and not very tasty, paling in comparison to the more delectable Spot Dessert next street over. The matcha powder is tasteless chalk unlike Lady M or Spot. Tea isn't that good as well and the prices here reflects the market they're trying to appeal to but not the quality of ingredients. You're paying strictly for the venue style and appearance of the place. Would not recommend this phoney-wannabe upscale tea dessert joint for anyone except wannabe rich posers flexing their nonexistent wealth.
Nicholas W.}Grosse Pointe, MI}602}119}56}-1}5}11/4/2015}Walked into here half-expecting something like Spot Dessert Bar (it's basically right behind Spot) - beautiful food that's tasty but not quite tasty enough to merit the price. Cha An's desserts still carry a premium price, but it's actually consummate with the taste. It's definitely worth it if you manage to snag one of the few tables in this little teahouse. The black sesame creme brulee is definitely one of their highlights. It's rare that you find a good black sesame dessert but they've pulled it off. It's sweet without being overpowering, leaving a nice crisp, cold taste in your mouth. Haven't had anything like it in a long time. Homemade mochi are also a highlight - it's really hard to find good green tea-flavored desserts and they nailed it (as you'd hope at a teahouse). They have plenty of other things on the menu but the emphasis is on the dessert. Lots of people instagramming their food accordingly - it is very beautiful. I'll definitely return!
Anna K.}Chicago, IL}1716}199}619}18}5}11/3/2015}I walked in here with a pal on a Sunday night and got lucky -- another party hadn't all arrived yet, so we got a table immediately! I ordered the Kago meal, which came with rice, 3 side dishes, a miso soup, and a dessert. It was all seriously delicious! I also ordered a Honey Phoenix Tea and some sort of green tea (I do not remember exactly what kind, sorry!). But it was all very satisfying. For dessert, we got some green tea pudding and a pound cake-like treat, and some chocolate, green tea, and sesame mochi. Mochi isn't my favorite, but that's a personal thing. They still were beautifully crafted and the food was great!It was a littttle pricey for my liking, but the food was quality, so I'll keep it at 5 Stars. Go here for a fancy night out!
DaYoung L.}Demarest, NJ}19}44}0}-1}4}11/1/2015}amazing desserts, minus one star because service tends to get so slow!
Jeff B.}San Francisco, CA}18}180}249}18}5}10/30/2015}For dessert, tried the Mochi Mochi and the Mango Pudding. Both good. Also got the "B" set dinner and the smoked salmon toast. Those were good too but next time I'll come back for some more dessert and tea.
Xi Y.}New York, NY}60}44}5}-1}5}10/26/2015}Their ice cream sandwich was the best! Loved every bite of it. The sesame cookie at the top was crispy and tasty, and I loved the chewiness of the two layers of wafer with the smooth ice cream in between.My friend didn't quite care for it, but profoundly enjoyed her green tea mochi and jelly with black syrup though.Their main dishes looked very appetizing as well. If we hadn't already had dinner, we would like to eat there. Maybe someday in the future.
Stephanie Q.}Boston, MA}491}1502}1294}18}4}10/25/2015}I came here at 12 noon on the dot for brunch on Sunday, because I was worried that it was going to be crowded. Thankfully, there wasn't much of a line and I got a table immediately.You can either choose to go to with the prie fixe sets, or with the lunch specials- uangi don or tekka don. The lunch specials include hot tea (genmaicha) unlike the prie fixe, so I went with that. They are $15 by the way. The tekka done was delicious, nice pieces of tuna on top of a bed of multigrain rice. The rice was SO GOOD. It also came with 2 side dishes, one was pickles and the other was okara. For desert, we shared the desert sampler. It came with pound cake (good), black sesame creme bruelee (good), some sort of ice cream which was AMAZING, special mochi with red bean inside. I say the mochi is special because it looked like actual grains of rice around red bean. I don't like red bean in general but I am sure it was good.They also have delicious looking toasts for brunch with salmon, and all sorts of toppings. This place is highly recommended.
Monica C.}New York, NY}22}78}415}-1}3}10/25/2015}The concept of a Japanese Tea House with a variety of desserts, teas, and savory dishes is appealing.  We ordered the Unagi Kabayaki with GenMai tea, the Smoked Salmon Toast with Chrysanthemum tea, and the Green Tea Parfait.  The food was fairly tasty with delicate flavors. But, there was much too much rice and bread with very little fish.  The tiny side dish that came with the Unagi set seemed to be made of tofu, but the waitress could not identify what she was serving and described it as mashed spinach which it definitely was not.  The tea was aromatic.  However, it appears that the quality has declined as the Chrysanthemum tea had a large blooming flower inside in the past, but there were no flower or leaves at all this time.The Green Tea Parfait dessert was interesting. The very top of the parfait glass was composed of a few chewy round white sticky rice mocha balls and one scoop of green tea ice cream with whipped green cream.  That was enjoyable, but the entire glass itself was filled with just rice crispies (yes, the cheap breakfast cereal). I expected that there would be at least a little bit of fruit or more ice cream instead of a glass full of rice crispies for $11.The concept of the Tea House was better than the actual execution.  As expected, everything was beautifully presented.  However, looks can be deceiving.  Substance was lacking and overpriced.
K T.}Philadelphia, PA}7}50}3}-1}2}10/24/2015}Desserts: 3/5Service: 0/5We came on a Friday night for a party of 5 and was told to come back 45 minutes later even though there were opened tables sitting there. We came back when we were texted to come back and sat at the SAME table that had been vacant there when we first entered. Wanting to sample a variety of desserts, we ordered a bunch to share. So, we had the cherry blossom flan, lychee ice cream, green tea ice cream, some other tea ice cream, 2 sesame creme brulee, green tea mochi, and sesame mochi. The trio of ice cream was the highlight. The sesame creme brulee and mochi were overwhelmingly sweet. The flan was ok. It was a bit bland and really nothing special. The service was beyond terrible. I never had my water refilled without asking. I had to constantly flagged down a waiter just to ask for my water to be refilled. No one came by and asked if everything was okay at all.
Rita Y.}Baltimore, MD}603}280}845}-1}3}10/23/2015}After seeing all those beautiful photos of desserts, I had to try out Cha-An while in East Village. I came here with my bf on a Tuesday night so there was no wait at all. But even though the place wasn't packed - the service was so disappointingly slow. You have to ask for water, you have to stare at the waiters with daggers in your eyes until they come over. What are they even doing?? We tried the Sesame Creme Brulee and got a pot of Dragon Well Tea. The teapot holds enough for 3-4 cups of tea which isn't too much. The Sesame Creme Brulee was really well presented and tasted great. Although the Sesame Ice Cream on top was the winner of the dessert. The creme brulee was really smooth and a custard texture. It was surprisingly lukewarm .. like it had been sitting out instead of in the fridge. The tuile on top also has bits of sesame seeds and taste fantastic as well.
Jessica M.}Vancouver, Canada}63}187}3214}-1}4}10/22/2015}Food: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Price: 3.5/5The teahouse is rather small with not many tables, so if you come at a bad time, you may find yourself waiting in line for a table. The four of us ordered a drink each; both iced and hot versions of their teas are available, and lattes as well. Their green teas are the most popular choice, but they also have oolong, black, white tea and much more.Cha-An Teahouse not only has desserts but a superb lunch menu! Donburis and prix fixe are also worth visiting for if you love Japanese food. They're well prepared and very appealing to all of your tastebuds! I'm definitely coming back for a full meal (lunch and dessert) next time I'm in the city. I decided to try their black sesame creme brûlée, my friend ordered their green tea parfait, and we decided to also share the Mochi Mochi. Though I don't have pictures of our drinks, each one of them was well prepared though I thought it was a tad bit expensive for the amount of tea we received. The iced hojicha  were my favourite!The desserts were absolutely delicious! Visuals on all of them were so pretty...that it's a shame if you don't take a picture of them in my opinion. Very instagram-worthy :D. It tasted even better than it looks! My favourite was the Mochi Mochi, where the combination of rice cake (mochi), red bean, and ice cream were spot on. I especially liked the black sesame creme brûlée because I had never tried anything like it before. If you're a lover of black sesame, I definitely recommend you try it! The parfait was pretty and delicious in my opinion, but my favourite was Mochi Mochi... because the texture of mochi was amazing. It's definitely not like the mochi you get at fro-yo stores, nor was it similar to the Korean version where it's sticky and glutinous. This is something you need to try for yourself!Anyway, the teahouse was full of people when we got up to leave. I'm definitely going to come back for their lunch prix fixe and I hope you get to try their desserts too. The teahouse is in a great neighbourhood with so much to do nearby. Hope I get to do an updated post on the teahouse one day with more in-depth photos!
Aggie N.}New York, NY}112}154}129}-1}5}10/19/2015}I have never had their actual meal but their tea and dessert.. o man! Theres many dessert spots in east village and this is def the top 3. Out of the rest, this place has the best ambiance which is great for dates! the rest of the dessert spots (ie spot dessert) are more college style/group setting
Steven S.}Philadelphia, PA}0}3}0}-1}3}10/19/2015}I Went there before my dinner party to drink Japanese Tea at their tea bar.  I was unhappy they were charging upwards of $7 for less than 2 grams of very low quality tea (like Yamamotoyama) which can be purchased two doors down at the Sunrise Mart from $5.99-$7.99 @ 250g.  I complained to the barista and he happily added more grams to a new teapot without charging extra.  Unfortunately the leaf was poor quality and by just adding more low quality tea is not going to bring the taste of Japanese sencha to NYC. But his service felt sincere.The food was OK but, not as delicious as food in Japan and hyper expensive compared to food in Japan.  The service was great, you can talk to the staff in english OR Japanese which is very rare! The best part of Cha An was their atmosphere, which I assume we're paying top price for.The desert was great and I think most people come here for their desert and probably not their tea.  One last thing - There's a Japanese toilet in the women's restroom which is fun to use if you've ever wondered how some toilets are fashioned in Japan.  The men's restroom had a western toilet.I was searching for an authentic Japanese tea house in NYC which can serve delicious Japanese tea.  After having tea at Cha An, I am still searching.
Angela H.}Richmond, Canada}1}6}6}-1}5}10/18/2015}This is a really authentic Japanese place! The whole room is decorated in such way that reminds me of the traditional tea shops in Japan. The desserts and food simply taste japanese! Everyone that works here seems to be japanese as well! Everything that is brought to the table is an art piece, delicate and beautiful. The ingredients are fresh and good qualities. It is a great place to sit down and have tea with sweets, although I much prefer the chinese black and green tea. The only downside is that the portions are really really small! Don't come here and expect a full meal without burning lots of money! Here is really to taste and appreciate the food. Also, compared with the typical japanese desserts, it is much sweeter here. At least sweeter than what I would like ( I am someone who doesn't like too much sweetness). Otherwise, highly recommend!!!
Emily C.}San Francisco, CA}184}625}135}18}4}10/17/2015}I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's such a cute date (or 'catch up with the girls') spot. Small and quaint, dim lighting, and the interior is like a Japanese tea house. In love before I even ordered and looked at the menu.I only saw reviews for desserts (mostly) but they do have actual food options. I didn't have any of it but it looked pretty good (donburi, toasts..)The desserts range from probably, $9-16 or so? It's SO worth it. (Not to mention you get really good pictures (and likes!) out of it too.)We shared:Black sesame creme brulee - it looked small but this is definitely good for 2 people to share. I don't even know how to explain it. It was creamy subtle black sesame heaven. It had a thin brulee crust on top, black sesame pudding for most of the middle layer, and then a more gritty and concentrated black sesame paste on the bottom. SO. GOOD. If you are a fan of black sesame, you muuuuuuuuuuust.Green tea iced cream sandwich (with green tea krispies). OK. I don't know how they did it. This was def. the best green tea ice cream I've had.. I'm really picky with this because I feel like the flavor usually is not concentrated enough or the texture is just off. But this was just perfect. And the green tea krispies were just the right amount of crisp and didn't overwhelm the ice cream flavor.YES. WILL DEF COME AGAIN.
Sarah Ilene K.}Manhattan, NY}3}9}0}-1}5}10/17/2015}I have been an ardent supporter of Cha An since discovering it almost ten years ago. A couple years back, they stopped serving their scones, soy milk quiche, and a few other things that I found heavenly. It was a sad time. Their staff has also changed somewhat in the last year. Wherein their old staff would easily make small modifications with their sets based on my aversion to shellfish, some of their new people are less accommodating. Still, I find it delicious, warm, and marvelous that they never try to expedite you and turn your table.
Danting H.}Jersey City, NJ}12}3}3}-1}2}10/17/2015}The food is ok. Not much selection. The place is small and delicate but the service is SUPER SLOW. We cannot get a simple water refill for half an hour. After several call, we have to get up and search for the water and refill it ourselves. The waiter or waitress do not collect our plates long after we finished and even after several calls, still no one came. We ordered dessert along with the main course so they know there are follow up order coming up but still nobody cares. The wasn't a busy day nor rush hours. There are 4 or 5 waiters/waitress but everybody is just wondering around without doing anything. I'm so confuse about their service and had a very unpleasant experience there. I wouldn't recommend coming here. There food is ok but with this kind of service, it's not worthwhile .
Anh N.}Fresh Meadows, NY}248}174}225}-1}3}10/15/2015}The good news...they take cards! I got the tuna tataki and my friend got the unagi for the donburi lunch specials. They were good, but not anything amazing.  There were roughly 4 pieces of tuna over loads of rice. I like rice but for $15 they can be a tad bit more generous with protein imo. Ambience was nice and cozy and service was pretty good. It took a while to get my tea refilled though. Dessert green tea whipped cream between 2 pastries was decent but not something I'd go out of my way for. It's a nice place worth trying but I wasn't wow'd. Perhaps next time, I'll come strictly for dessert.
Jacklyn C.}Brooklyn, NY}25}18}38}-1}4}10/14/2015}I am a frequent visitor of Cha-An and bring new people here all the time. It's a cute little Japanese teahouse that also serves late lunch and set meals, but I come here mostly for the tea and black sesame creme brulee. You can get unlimited refills of hot water for a pot of tea (priced around $6) to share. The desserts are well presented and not too sweet. The bonus is the Japanese toilet in the ladies' room. I could spend all day in there...Warning: It does get crowded on nights and weekends with limited waiting area, so come early!
Karen Mercy P.}Piscataway Township, NJ}119}13}132}-1}1}10/10/2015}You guys need a better system on receiving your guests.  We waited in the staircase for a solid 40 minutes and you declined to take our names while waiting. You sat a larger group who came in later without reservation.
Muke W.}Bloomington, IN}2}7}1}-1}5}10/9/2015}Their Delicate fresh food with good traditional Japanese tea and dessert always made my day.
Ha Eun K.}Princeton, NJ}211}9}4}-1}5}10/6/2015}I've heard people rave about this place, so I've tried to go a few times, but yesterday was the first day I actually made it there.Time:  2Pm on a weekday is perhaps the best choice because there was no line, and it was quiet; a good place to have some tea and catch up with a friend over amazing dessert. What I like about the dessert is that it's unique, and I love black sesame, red beans and green tea so that helps a lot too. Price : high, but worth it, at least for the black sesame creme brule. SO GOOD.  Price was not so worth it for the raspberry butter toast ; it wasn't anything special, just literally toast with raspberry jam and whipped cream (I think it was whipped cream). But great to fill you up!
Crystal W.}Simi Valley, CA}51}187}18}-1}5}10/2/2015}I am a black sesame fiend. I love black sesame everything. So when I found out that this place serves a black sesame creme brûlée (a top fav dessert of mine), black sesame ice cream, AND a black sesame wafer... All in one single dessert, I just knew I had to get this. I actually had dessert earlier that day, so I was really contemplating on whether or not I needed a second one. But seeing as how this was my last day in town, I didn't want to miss my chance & regret it later. Best decision ever!! I absolutely LOVED the intense black sesame flavor in it. The ice cream had the most flavor especially & was nice & creamy. The custard part was also thick & creamy. Everything was done very well & it was well worth the extra calories consumed that day. Definitely glad my self-control took a backseat that day haha
Tammie K.}New York, NY}279}157}133}18}3}10/1/2015}My experience at Cha-An was mediocre at best, which is unfortunate considering all the other glowing Yelp reviews. I came here with my friend Sunday during lunch time and was seated right away. The decor here is nice and I really did feel as if I had been transported to a small Japanese teahouse. The main issue here was the slow and poor service. After we were seated, my friend and I were basically neglected for close to 20 minutes. No water to drink, no server to speak with, nothing. After finally flagging down a server, she took our orders and scurried off (not bothering to offer any helpful suggestions despite our questions). We overlooked that and excitedly looked forward to our food. However, that ended up being another 30-40 minute wait. Servers were not friendly at all when we tried to follow-up. Considering the price and authentic "tea house" vibe I was getting, I was hoping for more attentive service.The items we ordered:1) Matcha green tea latte (both hot as well as the one with the ice cream + red bean)Yum! Definitely tasted the matcha and really loved how it wasn't too sweet. The hot one was served in a bowl and had red beans on the bottom.2) Tuna tataki lunch setI had actually ordered the unagi bowl, but was given this instead. I'm not complaining cause this was a pretty interesting dish. Tuna was slightly seared, tasty, and went well with the rice. The seven grain rice they use was seasoned and had a lot of texture to it, which I enjoyed since I love anything chewy. 3) Tea smoked salmon toastMy friend and I were a bit underwhelmed by this. The smoked salmon itself was tasty, but there was just too much bread. It got a little too messy to cut through everything and so we just deconstructed the entire toast. Basically tea smoked salmon salad + thick piece of toast.4) Black sesame creme brûléeYES!!! I enjoy eating creme brûlée in general and absolutely loved this Japanese take on it. Very creamy, with the perfect amount of sesame flavor. Also appreciated how it wasn't too sweet. 5) ParfaitMy friend ordered this and I tried a bite of it. It's an interesting dessert with a lot of different textures and flavors going on. Green tea ice cream, mochi, and red bean rest on top of a bed of hard, roasted rice crisps (which was a bit bitter). I wasn't a big fan, but my friend who had tried similar parfaits in Japan claims that the one here at Cha'An was pretty authentic. Overall,(+) Desserts live up to the hype and worth a try (-) Extremely slow and nonexistent service(-) Can probably find better options for lower prices
Brutally H.}Boston, MA}50}115}0}-1}4}9/24/2015}My companion liked the 7 grain porridge. Black sesame creme brûlée, matcha latte, and sesame ice cream were good.  Cookies, cake with raspberry sauce, salmon, tofu switch mushroom, and fermented fish were ok.
Raymond H.}Los Angeles, CA}258}83}8}-1}5}9/21/2015}Great spot to grab dessert and tea. Black sesame creme brûlée is a must try!!!Opted to try the matcha green tea. Very small portion for what they give you but rich taste and it is good. Also tried the soufflé and ice cream sandwich which are also very good choices. Cute spot but small so expect a slight wait
Justine Y.}Manhattan, NY}5}81}2}-1}4}9/18/2015}Very tiny, fairly authentic Japanese teahouse in the heart of the East Village.Went for the iced matcha and was happy with it - and I've sampled my faire share of Tokyo teahouses before. It's tough to find great matcha, and it's harder still to pay upwards of $10 for it, but I'd do it any day here at Cha-An.The presentation is great, too, although I wasn't a huge fan of the sesame crème brulee. It was pretty watery and just wasn't what I had imagined it to ideally be? Like, it had the consistency of vanilla pudding tasting of sesame...Lots of skinny Asian hipsters with your occasional whackadoo otaku but it's such a relaxing place and I, for one, instantly feel more self-conscious when I'm at Cha-An where everything is refined and elegant. And I personally count the Baccarat bar as one of my favorites!Solid choice to while away a few hours or if you've got a weird gap of time in between appointments/mtgs.
Tracy W.}New York, NY}338}52}39}18}5}9/13/2015}Came here for desserts after dinner because Spot Dessert Bar had too long of a wait. And I'm so glad we did! This place is very small and easy to miss if you're not looking for it. The atmosphere was intimate and minimalistic and reminded me very much of the restaurants that I've visited in Tokyo.I shared a $20 dessert sampler with my bf because we couldn't decide what to get. Also got a pot of chrysanthemum tea for $6. Dessert sampler came with a black sesame creme brulee and ice cream, lychee ice cream with a brownie and strawberries, some home made cookies, and mochi. All were fantastic tasting although the portions were definitely on the smaller side. My favorite was the lychee ice cream. It was fresh and very true to lychee flavor. This place is great for dates because of the intimate and cozy vibe & it's fairly quiet so you can actually have a conversation without yelling. Definitely coming back to this place to try their dinner options!
Khai Yeap S.}Sunset Park, NY}1}3}2}-1}4}9/11/2015}Dessert and tea house. Had the dessert sampler set. Creme brûlée was good. Black sesame ice cream is good too but not too special.
Blair W.}Norfolk, VA}4}49}128}-1}3}9/8/2015}I love this little tea place in terms of ambiance but the food is really not those I expected... The famous black sesame cream brulee was so-so, their matcha latte is just okay.. They are not cheap and they only take cash.. I think I deserve more quality Japanese desserts regarding these facts.. And I wish they had some proper air conditioning..
Aki K.}Myrtle Beach, SC}0}60}856}-1}4}9/8/2015}Came here for desserts. The drinks were on the spot. Desserts are pretty good. Would recommend the black sesame and flan. The green tea parfait was a little disappointing. It was below expectation. The green beans were stuck at the bottom so it was difficult to eat.  Service was great. Staff is super friendly and did not rush the customers.
Melissa G.}New York, NY}19}192}88}18}4}9/7/2015}4 stars thanks to the black sesame creme brulee. Get this and tea and you will be set! I love the crunchy black sesame candy on top combined with the smooth ice cream and luscious creme brulee. The black sesame flavor comes out nicely in the ice cream and creme brulee. Close to a perfect dessert. 3 stars for the other food. 2 stars for service. We, as well as others around us, waited a long time for our food. We also had to ask for them to clear our dishes before dessert. Overall, I felt a bit ignored. Still, I'd come back for the black sesame creme brulee. It's dream-able.
Millie H.}Hoboken, NJ}210}235}8}-1}5}9/7/2015}The BEST Japanese dessert/snack/tea place in new. Your city. If you don't know what you want, get the chef's pick (a super sampler) I like the salmon with fish roes :)
Alice W.}Fairfax, VA}486}721}2088}18}3}9/7/2015}Intimate and cozy Japanese tea and dessert place. It's small and seats just about 20 people so during busy hours, you may have to wait for awhile. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for two; luckily, St. Mark's has plenty of other things to see and do so we walked around and before long, they were texting us. The decor is traditional Japanese with wooden floors, bamboo dividers, rice paper lamps, even their restroom has a Japanese toilet.We came here for desserts. They accept credit cards now but it's a $16 minimum. We chose the chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce ($9) and the black sesame crème brûlée ($9), as well as a pot of Dragon Well green tea ($7). Tea was good. Very smooth and traditional Chinese longjing tea. The leaves were steeped in a kyusu teapot (versus in a Yixing clay teapot which is the traditional practice for achieving a finer Longjing taste profile but we'll overlook this). Honestly, the tea was the best part of our meal. The desserts were fine. Chocolate soufflé was rich like chocolate soufflés are. I preferred the black sesame crème brûlée; the black sesame in particular was very creamy and the highlight of the dish. Not too sweet, not super rich. The quintessence of Japanese desserts. Much prefer Cha-An over nearby Spot Dessert Bar. Like I mentioned earlier, credit cards are now accepted, including AMEX, but minimum is $16.
Yuki Z.}Evanston, IL}238}81}143}-1}5}9/6/2015}Legit Japanese place. I only got the dessert sampler but they are really good! The ambiance is pretty nice, feeling Japanese. The restaurant is relatively small, so you prob have to wait during peak hours, but when we went there it was not bad at all! The dessert sampler came with 5 different desserts in bite size. I love the Mochi one especially. It is really well made! A negative part is that the service is pretty slow. The waiters are really taking their times..we waited for 10 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes to get the check..we were not that in a hurry that night so it was acceptable but still..
Suzy Y.}Manhattan, NY}1}26}10}-1}3}9/2/2015}Got the green tea parfait (but they did have green tea ice cream so substitute it with Hoji ice cream). I liked that this dessert was not overly sweet. However, the bottom portion of the parfait wasn't as good since it was just rice krispies and whip cream.
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}4}8/31/2015}Cha-An is a cozy little Japanese tea and dessert place.The appetizers are a hit or miss. The teas are definitely overpriced, but the desserts are well worth it. The green tea parfait and the black sesame creme brulee are amazing.
Sue S.}Manhattan, NY}4}57}4}-1}2}8/30/2015}Overpriced tea and desserts, very sweet items, have been a couple times because friends from out of town often seem to have this on their list of places to go
Jay K.}New York, NY}6}12}1}-1}5}8/28/2015}I went out with the roommates and had the toast and the kago set. The salmon was on point.
Mel T.}Manhattan, NY}6}39}0}-1}4}8/28/2015}Small space but lovely service. I can see how this place would have a long wait but it was easy seating on a sunday afternoon. I had their iced matcha drink which was ok. It wasn't overly sweet which I like, however, I like my matcha to have more of an earthy taste than the one I had. Perhaps a warm matcha latte here would taste better? The food is good and the black sesame ice cream with the creme brulee was a delightful mix of textures. I would come back and try the other desserts and drinks.
Bella J.}Bellevue, WA}0}7}1}-1}5}8/25/2015}The ice cream is simply delicious! The lychee has little jellies in it and a little bit of food goes a long way. Greatly priced for the quality of food!
Anny S.}New York, NY}141}139}725}-1}4}8/24/2015}MATCHA DRINK WITH ICE CREAM AND RED BEAN 4.5/5- This drink is just soooo refreshing and yummy. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, nor is it overpowered by the matcha flavor. It is light and milky. I recommend getting the ice cream and red beans combination. It's predominately vanilla ice cream with swirls of green tea ice cream and the red bean has a great fresh bean texture that doesn't taste like it was previously frozen. TEA-SMOKED SALMON OVER TOAST 4/5 - This is a perfect dish to start. The toast has a nice crunch and the salmon was fresh with a nice sauce drizzled on top with some mesclun mixed leaves. I wish the toast was not as thick as there were only 4 salmon pieces, and it was not heavy so I think the thickness of the bread was too much. Nonetheless, tasty.TUNA TATAKI 4/5- Tuna cooked medium rare and perfection over some wild rice. Super simple dish but very tasty. Could not finish all the rice because I wanted to save room for dessert!BLACK SEASAME ICE CREAM & CREME BRULEE 4/5 - If you were going to have any dessert, you must get this! Creamy, sweet, and delightful. Share this dessert with another person and get another dessert on their menu.SERVICE - 5/5 I came here Sunday early evening, so the place was not packed. The service was phenomenal. The waiter was very attentive and checked up on us frequently. It was a pleasant experience to eat here!
Sherry L.}San Francisco, CA}844}1085}716}18}4}8/23/2015}Try to get here at an off-peak time so you can avoid the wait.The place is small, but tables are spaced out enough so that you don't feel crowded. If you get lucky (like we did), you might get to use the private room, which looks kind of like a little shack that sits in a corner of the restaurant. There's no door, and the walls are thin, but it offers a bit of privacy!The black sesame creme brûlée is always a huge hit, and I agree, it is a very unique take on the classic French dessert. However, I do think that it is quite pricey for what you are getting. The presentation is cute, sure, but your eyes can only eat so much.Don't order the mochi!! Especially if you are a huge mochi fan or have had the privilege of trying homemade mochi.  Cha An's mochi is nothing special, and the few that came in my friend's order looked..and tasted kind of stale.My matcha latte was pretty yummy! It was served with a scoop of green tea ice cream and some red bean. The red bean got a little sweet towards the end, but overall, I really enjoyed my latte.  My only gripe is with the pricing of the menu items. It's a great place to take friends or family from out of town if you are trying to impress them. Otherwise, I'm almost 100% positive you can get similar desserts at a lower price elsewhere!
Amanda L.}Brooklyn, NY}57}110}129}-1}4}8/22/2015}Really solid Japanese tea room by St. Marks with good food. I came here with two friends for a late lunch -- Cha An, why do you open at 2pm on Thursdays?!?!?!? We had heard many good things about this place and wanted to see if it was worth the hype.We ordered:- raspberry butter toast ($10) plus a scoop of green tea ice cream (+$3): the bread is amazing. It's slightly crunchy on the outside with a soft inside that is so, so buttery. The butter flavor is actually so prominent that it balances out the raspberry sauce. However, my friend did complain that the sauce was too sweet, especially since it's a big slice of toast. I would recommend sharing this amongst friends to have it in moderation so it isn't too sweet.- tea smoked salmon toast ($13): this is one of the most popular dishes there and we could definitely see why. It's a tangy salad and yummy salmon served on top of a thick slice of toast. What more could you want? More salmon, that's what. My friend mentioned that there was little salmon for the amount of bread and salad there was. She also said that she couldn't really taste the tea in the fish. - tuna tataki donburi lunch special ($13): this lunch set comes with the daily side dish and pickled veggies and genmai tea. The sear on the tuna was just right and it had a good amount of heat and acidity that kept me wanting more. The seven grain rice that it comes with is also really good and goes so much better with the tuna than white rice would have. My side dish was noodles that kind of tasted like a cold, Japanese version of japchae. It's a cute place to catch up with friends or go on a date. The staff is really friendly and attentive, though we didn't get glasses of water until we asked (perhaps because she didn't know if we were gonna order tea, which we did not). The food was good, but definitely pricey for the portions that they gave. $13 for raspberry toast? The tuna tataki was the only thing we ordered that would've sufficed as a meal because the other two were more like snacks. I would recommend this place, but come once to try the desserts and toasts but come again for the reasonably priced lunch specials.
Wai Yan Z.}New London, CT}1}25}23}-1}5}8/20/2015}This place is worth for waiting! The smoke salmon thick toast is amazing!!!! Must try!!! The dessert collection is good, too! But I think only the sesame ice-cream is outstanding! Really strong sesame flavour!! Yum.. The one that has green tea ice-cream with chestnut, red bean, mochi, jelly and brown sugar (I forget the name of it) is a bit too sweet for me. I would probably try something else next time instead of this. :)
Cree P.}Jamaica, NY}125}121}291}18}4}8/14/2015}Came here with some of my friends one night and we had a pretty good time. It's a small spot kinda of secretly hidden because it's upstairs. The interior of the tea house is so nice and my friends and I were lucky enough to get their secluded room, which was nice because we got to have some privacy. Plus it also felt as if we were having a very important meeting and discussing things over tea.The desserts were so good and not too sweet, which is one thing I love about Asian desserts. The quality of the desserts was amazing! The only downside to this place is they have nearly a 20% gratuity and they only take cash. Of course we all had cards, except for my one friend, if it weren't for him who knows what would have happened. I'd come back here, only if I had some spare cash to spend because this place is a little on the pricey side, especially with that gratuity slapped on, but it is worth it.
Alexander W.}Manhattan, NY}559}606}1165}18}4}8/13/2015}Cha-An must be banking from the black sesame creme brulee.. Cha-ching! The dessert had a uniqueness that was unbeknownst to my taste buds. The melding of the texture and flavor dazzled and hypnotized my senses.
Maggie L.}New York, NY}280}72}153}-1}4}8/11/2015}Slow service - took at least 20 minutes to take our order. We asked for water and got it 10 minutes later. But the waiter did apologized, so I wouldn't hold this on him too much. He seemed like a new worker. Food - loved the combo a, made me feel cozy and warm. It was made with simple ingredients but the taste was very good and it felt like home.Dessert - the brownie/ sorbet and flan were amazing, delicious and subtle. Love it love it love it.
Annie Z.}San Francisco, CA}13}23}19}-1}5}8/2/2015}Have since moved to the west coast but this is possibly the ONLY restaurant in New York that could make me consider moving back :) First came here two or three years ago when a friend brought me. Tried out their desserts and fell in love. Then I discovered they had these amazing hot matcha lattes served in pretty ceramic bowls with azuki (red bean) inside! Have been totally obsessed since and sometimes go there twice in one week just for that. One of the most delicious matcha lattes ever. Their traditional hot matcha (the more bitter type) served with a side of mochi and azuki is also very authentic. Their food (they have these lunch and dinner sets) is very healthy, delicious, and authentic too. Love the rice and the porridge. And there was once they had this really delicious pork dish. The service is also amazing - staff is polite and attentive. Some also speak Japanese!
Jason D.}New York, NY}85}2}0}-1}5}7/31/2015}Great atmosphere, amazing tea! You receive multiple steeps, which is nice, and the desserts are fantastic!
Riri C.}Manhattan, NY}0}69}0}-1}3}7/28/2015}Love the tea and desserts, they are a wonderful fusion of East and West with things like sesame ice cream over a creme brulee. However the service here is really frustrating. The food will take forever, the seating and ordering will take forever and the check will take forever. I can't tell if they are understaffed or something. One star off for the mediocre service, and one off because prices are on the higher side.
Ying L.}New York, NY}207}53}178}-1}4}7/27/2015}This is a tiny place that is easily passed over if you're just walking down the street, luckily for me the first time I came here I was trying green tea flavored desserts in the city and Cha-An came up.Walk past a small door, ascend up the creaky wooden stairs and wait to be seated. The staff seems to double as both waiters and chefs so service may take a while. I recommend going early evening, their lunch menu lasts until 6pm and is absolutely worth it.The atmosphere of this place is expressively Japanese. Wooden, bamboo settings with a right corner is slightly fenced off should your party wish for more privacy. But I don't recommend bringing a party of more than four people here, since wait times could take a while for the staff to combine tables.Cha-An does tea and dessert best. However, I opted for the mini dessert with the lunch special because I was a bit more hungry. The Tuna Tataki was delicately flavored and absolutely delicious. I've never had tuna in such a way so it was quite an experience. Unfortunately, the mini dessert I choose (Green Tea Pudding) was unavailable, but this wasn't communicated to me until very late so I took points off for that. However, since I was with several friends, we decide to try the dessert sampler. Totally worth it for a decent sized party. I highly recommend their creme brûlée and black sesame ice cream, those two dishes were absolutely the stars of the show. Yuzu ice cream with fresh fruit was a close second. The red bean mochi was not exactly appealing to me but I highly suggest trying it for those who have adventurous palettes.In all, I would return here on a quiet day with the rain slightly drizzlingly outside, maybe bring a book.
Peter P.}Flushing, NY}58}4}3}-1}1}7/25/2015}Not sure why they gave us plastic cups ... drinks were over priced for the taste and quality.... would not come back ...
Bill S.}Long Island, NY}600}2264}4053}18}4}7/25/2015}Cha-an... Chain of fools.. Oh, not in the mood for a dance break? Well, too bad! Lets talk about this place in the East Village. I'm with my food posse and they don't know anything about Cha-An.We walk up the stairs and are faced with a curtain. There is a small bench and hardly any standing room. I know my brother in law, he's gonna dig this place.After about 30 minutes of waiting, we are finally seated. Cha-An is a small chill spot. They have great teas as well as desserts. I know what I want, I saw pictures on Yelp and I'm on a mission. Also, there is a no sharing or tasting rule in effect. I don't want any forks or spoons near my dessert. I don't want to share and I don't need to taste yours thankyouverymuch.The dessert list shows something of a milk shake, its a Macha Tea Latte and it comes in three levels:Basic - Macha tea LatteIntermediate - Mache tea Latte topped with ice creamFull blown - Mache tea Latte topped with ice cream and some other red bean thingy.My brother in law and I opt for the Mache tea Latte topped with ice cream. My sister in law orders a dessert sampler and my wife orders Homemade Mochi which comes three per order and had one of each flavor: green tea, black sesame and earl grey chocolate. I ask my wife: Are you sure, this is what you want? Mochi has a sticky outer coating. Its not like Tartufo. Nope, its what I want. (I am so not sharing my dish)I ordered the famous Black Sesame Creme Brûlée. The Macha tea Lattes come out. My sister in law takes a Biiiiig swig and says eww! Macha tea has a distinct flavor. I thought it would be more creamier/sweeter with the ice cream topping/latte, it was ok. This drink isn't sweet like the Stand4 (man I loved that place) Toasted Marshmallow shake. Its more of a subtle flavor, not too sweet but enough to satisfy.My wife Homemade Mochi comes out and she makes a face. The outside is sticky. Yeah... I'm ready to move to another table when my dessert comes out.Black Sesame Creme Brûlée is everything they say it is and then some. This dessert is complex with flavors. The sesame along with the actual "creme" is not the typical Creme Brûlée dessert with caramelized sugar. The dessert is topped with with a crispy sesame piece that's similar to the caramelized sugar.This is a great dessert place if you're looking for something different. This is not Paris Baguette. Cha-An is a speciality tea house that offers great desserts. I have to point out this is a cash only establishment.
Sophia X.}Manhattan, NY}330}55}65}-1}5}7/22/2015}Probably my favorite restaurant/dessert bar in the city. There tea smoked salmon toast is to die for! Note it's the tea smoked one not the grilled salmon one. Once I got the grilled salmon by accident and I was so sad in disappointment :((Tea smoked salmon toast is a very crispy chunk of toast topped with salad and large slices of smoked salmon belly drizzled with this delicious mustard sauce! I've eaten this around 10 times and still crave for this every once in a while!If you like matcha then also go to this place! Aside from actual matcha, they also have matcha latte, parfait, creme brûlée and many more options!This place is furnished like a japanese tea house, and there are a few dividers to ensure privacy. The wait is usually less than 5 minutes if there even is one. Service is really good too.Just remember it's cash only! Can be a little frustrating to realize after the meal haha.
Patcharaorn T.}Manhattan, NY}112}39}378}-1}5}7/22/2015}This is perfect for lunch, dinner, afternoon tea and everything in between. I enjoy match and the sesame ice cream because I love intense flavor. The restaurant is on the second floor and it was small. However it worth the wait and I highly recommend this place
林濬}Newport Beach, CA}45}1}0}-1}1}7/21/2015}The food and the services are sucks. I forgot my phone and when I went back to ask them to return my phone, they asked to add more tips! That's ridiculous! What's difference between robbery?
Andy L.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}0}-1}3}7/21/2015}A nice and delicate place.Went here at night with my date and the experience was excellent (I was on a date so whatever I do, even just sitting around in silence, is perfect) ---BUT the service killed itWhen I first got there, it was full and there was a couple that came in with us (they were one step ahead of us though) and the four of us stood there for like a good 5 minutes before someone even got to us to tell us to wait. Like yo you can just greet us and say "please wait" or something but nah let's pace up and down like you're busy or something (although they just chilling there carrying nothing) and without even looking at us "wait"... dafaq?The food was good (forgot what we had though because my date too cute and I can't get my eyes off her)To conclude: food was good but service was #$@%Oh last remark, the green tea matcha drink was GREAT!!
Vivian M.}West Haven, CT}0}26}417}-1}3}7/21/2015}Good service, creative desserts and traditional Japanese food. Love the setting and location of the store. However desserts are little overpriced. Nice place for lunch and afternoon break.
Zizi L.}Los Angeles, CA}472}51}5}-1}3}7/19/2015}Everything about tea! Great place! Nice desert and environment. Suitable for hanging out with friends while enjoying the company of tea.A bit over price tho.
Emily T.}Towaco, NJ}3}32}0}-1}4}7/15/2015}Despite very slow service and a pricey menu, the food was absolutely delicious along with their Saki and tea. Tea smoked salmon def a recommendation. Nice ambience too.
Priscilla O.}San Francisco, CA}14}52}21}-1}5}7/15/2015}Matcha and an intimate setting...what more you ask for? Their seasonal desserts are interesting and tasty. He had the black sesame creme brûlée  and I had the cherry blossom flan.
Lauren T.}New York, NY}469}149}620}-1}3}7/14/2015}Wait time was not bad, only around 30 minutes on a week night. Can come for savory or just dessert, or both. Would recommend the black sesame creme brûlée and the green tea parfait. Decadent. Note: This place has a $15 credit card minimum.
Tiffany E.}Hong Kong}520}345}1029}-1}3}7/14/2015}Although this place's tea sets and desserts had a nice concept, my bf and I just thought this place was okay. He ordered the Tea Set B while I got the Smoked Salmon Toast and Black Sesame Creme Brulee. My food was fine, I actually really liked it although I felt that the toast could've had more salmon considering the price ($13). Mustard sauce was aN interesting addition to this dish that I liked :) My bf didn't really like his set and said that the food was just okay. My favorite part was the creme brûlée actually! It's really unique and the taste isn't heavy. The sesame ice cream on top is also something I've never had before so 5 stars for that. Sadly, this place still didn't do it for me. The waitress also whisked my creme brûlée away from us before we even finished!!!! If you come here, I recommend sticking with the desserts or snacks and not the tea sets.
LIYA B.}New York, NY}360}64}96}-1}4}7/13/2015}For presentation and for authenticity I give this place a 5/5 stars. The bathroom even had sliding doors. For taste I would say, def a lack of sweetness. Not for the sweet tooth fanatic. But you should know, Asian sweets are not meant to be very sweet. It's not your traditional mochi that you get at your sushi places, this is like the real deal raw dough. I guess I'm not used to it. I would say it's different. Cool place to try if you're looking to try something unique and different.
Jie S.}New York, NY}63}18}6}-1}1}7/13/2015}This place used to be good, but they are really bad at service now. Why cash only? It's not like your food is cheap. And it takes more than an hour for food to come. Every table who came and sit after us got their food before our table. They just forgot what to serve us. I think customers have a choice to decide how much tip to give. We were disappointed so we gave little tip, and the waitress, who knew that we waited for an hour for the food, ran after us and ask for more tip. After we explained how terrible out dinning experience was, the waitress acted really rude and left.Japanese restaurants are famous for good service, but you guys don't serve your customers and just want the money. Never come back again.
Jonathan K.}Walnut, CA}3}15}13}-1}5}7/10/2015}Just ate here for a dinner/late night snack with my girlfriend, and it was perfect! The service was on point, the salmon toast was delicious and was good in every single way and the green tea parfait was unique and aesthetically beautiful! I enjoyed the cute scenery in the restaurant and would definitely go here again when I'm in New York ^^
Sam L.}Montgomery City, MO}0}2}0}-1}1}7/5/2015}Food is very decent and delicate. That's why so many people like here. However, the restaurant is extremely arrogant. Three of us came in for a dessert treat. Two of us were not hungry or felt like eating much. So I ordered a 24 dollars set and a green tea drink to share. The waitress told us that each customer has to order one stuff that over 6 dollars and said you guys only ordered two things. What is that?? We are not here just to use your restroom or get your air-con, we are your customers. Plz show some respect! Arrogant place. Never gonna come again.
A N.}Washington, DC}7}15}0}-1}5}7/4/2015}Why haven't I review this place yet after all these years? We try to go here every single time we're in NY because I just love it so much! The dessert is the best thing here, go elsewhere for dinner and come here for dessert (but make sure you have some room left in your tummy for this!) Really awesome matcha green tea, the flavor was strong but not too strong and not too watered down like other places. The brulee is another favorite of mine...I just want to eat everything when I come here...
Sam C.}Manhattan, NY}506}52}27}-1}4}7/4/2015Updatedreview}Definitely a new favorite dessert spot! The black sesame ice cream has definitely become one of my favorite ice creams in the area, and the sampler is a perfect end-of-date dessert.
Sumito A.}Manhattan, NY}299}418}1032}-1}2}7/4/2015}Get to the Chase:Pros:1) Desserts and tea, that's Cha-An's forte2) If you're getting a meal then opt for an iced sencha grean tea, otherwise order the delicious classic matcha latte 3) Black sesame brulee was out of this world! Best savory dish was the tofu with sesame sauce4) Great presentationCons:1) Dirty silverware where you can see oily fingerprints and smudges all over the cups and glasses isn't something you want to eat out of (see one of my photos)2) Brought desserts with the appetizers, chopsticks for soup and forks for ice cream...are we supposed to eat the creme brulee with the pike mackerel?? I love a challenge, but this is ridic3) Neither the menu nor did our waiter tell us that the set meal already included the pike mackerel...so we ended up ordering double portions of the same dish, which wasn't even that good...uh thanks for the heads up4) Small place with sometimes up to an hour wait on weekendsOverall, I don't know why there is always a line for this place. Cha-an is a quaint small venue that serves a great variety of teas for a minimum price of $7 which is on the high end, with a hit or miss on some of the desserts. Although it tries to do a bit of everything, it isn't a restaurant but a so-so dessert shop. Stick with Chikalicious if you have a sweet tooth craving.
Linh Q.}Philadelphia, PA}64}31}162}-1}2}7/3/2015}Our first time visiting this place. The place is small. We got seated in this tea room in the back which made us left isolated from the rest of the people. After we got seated shortly the server came to take our order and we waited about 10 minutes for our dessert to arrive. Pros: the dessert were great granted it was a bit on the pricey side for dessert. We ordered the dessert sampler and chocolate soufflé. My favorite was the black sesame creme brûlée from the dessert sampler. I must say for that price the portion was a bit small. Con: We did not get any water at all and the server never came to check on us after bringing us the dessert. We never even got our check. We had to walk up to them to ask for a check. Is it suppose to be that way? Although we had no service whatsoever my husband still tip them 18%. If it wasn't for the poor service we received this place would sure get 4 stars from me rather than 2. For 2 dessert we walked out paying close to $40 which in my opinion is a bit expensive especially the service we received. I hope they care enough to read this review and perhaps improve on that part as service is a very important factor when it comes to dining out.
Xander X.}Flushing, NY}0}1}1}-1}1}7/3/2015}$6 minimum to sit with our friendsalso we werent served water also smells like doodoi
Ami R.}Brooklyn, NY}0}22}0}-1}1}7/2/2015}This is probably my fourth time at cha an.  The first three experiences were with various friends and it has always been enjoyable, the food and of course the tea innovative and well-executed.My most recent visit was mostly negative and that was due to the customer service.There menus say cash only, so I asked the waiter in the beginning of the meal where the nearest ATM was and he pointed across the street.So I ordered and enjoyed my set meal.After I finished dessert, I asked for the check and told the waiter that I was going across the street for the ATM.He asked to hold on to my ID, which I found offensive and just pointed to my iphone 6 i left on the table.Something about his question did not feel right to me.When I got back I asked to see the manager and a women in chef whites came over.I asked her if this was policy to hold IDs of patrons who are going across the street to an ATM the staff suggests.She replied that they now accept credit cards.You think one of the waiters who I mentioned ATM to would have told me?It would have saved me a 2$ ATM fee as well as the offense and shame I felt when they asked for my ID when I was literally visible by a window.As I said, poor customer service, strange profiling (who knows what made him ask for ID).I will not be back as it was not as peaceful as I was hoping for.
Carmen W.}Brooklyn, NY}214}274}220}18}3}7/1/2015}I've come here a handful of times the past two years, and I'd have to admit that it's a love-hate relationship. They have their good days, where all their desserts are perfect and their off days where their chocolate souffle (is undercooked). On their good days, their staff will tell us about their special water and be super friendly. On their off days, their staff won't let us share dessert and kick us out if we dont each order something...The environment here is extremely befitting of their concept, but I hope this place has more of their "good days"!
Chao L.}Brooklyn, NY}401}117}1}-1}4}6/22/2015}Another place i would stop by to fill in my sweet tooth. Their black sesame creme brulee is superrrrrr delicious!!! Cant wait to come back here and try different stuff, although the wait time can be longggggggggggg at times!
Anchisa P.}Boston, MA}202}97}82}-1}4}6/21/2015}Great Japanese dessert. Would recommend the jasmine tea ice cream - so good! Other desserts (black sesame creme brulee, zenzai) were pretty good but slightly too sweet. So-so service.
Susanna L.}Brooklyn, NY}130}218}97}18}4}6/12/2015}Came here with a group of three people looking for a little bite to eat. Seating was fast on a Saturday night. We ordered the dessert sampler and the smoke salmon French toast. ... All I can say is smoked salmon French toast!!! The toast was so delicious and crunchy. The salmon so fresh and tasty. Don't get me started with the mustardy sauce that went with the toast, I wish I could buy a jar!!! The dessert sampler was also very tasty. Consisted of 5 mini desserts great for sharing. Common denominator for all 5 was black sesame, which I wouldn't care for on other days. But it was actually pretty good. Crime brûlée was spot on.The menu consisted of other desserts that were mouthwatering, I'll just have to come back to try the rest.. And of course the smoked salmon French toast of course ;)
Cici C.}New York, NY}15}20}4}-1}2}6/9/2015}Do not come here for the food. It's overpriced and tasteless. The EGG SALAD TOAST made me feel nauseous after taking a few bites. The pork with taro appetizer was bland. The pork was poorly trimmed. I felt like I was eating mostly FAT. On the bright side, I came here for the dessert before because the dessert looked appealing and actually tasted really good. Stick to the DESSERT and TEA only.
Mengze Z.}New York, NY}44}98}145}-1}4}6/9/2015}Love their mocha smoothie drinks with red bean ! Delicate Japanese food! Food is in small portion, location is hard to find.
Geekar L.}Brooklyn, NY}96}326}1256}18}4}6/8/2015}My friends and I decided to come here for dessert after dinner on a Saturday night. It's a single door and walk up to the second floor. We waited about 30 mins. for seats, but only because we chose not to sit at the bar. Pretty cozy spot with a good selection of teas. We ordered the black sesame creme brûlée and mochi to share. I just want to say that I love black sesame to begin with, but I loved the creme brûlée. Flavorful black sesame and a nice consistency. The mochi was pretty good as well; I liked that it wasn't overly sweet, not even the earl grey chocolate one! We decided to get one of each flavor and my friends and I each liked a different flavor. We ordered tea as well, chrysanthemum, jasmine and flower craft tea. They all tasted as expected and went well with our desserts. I would love to come back to check out other menu items!
Joyce Q.}Brooklyn, NY}7}18}21}-1}4}6/7/2015}CASH ONLYYOut of all the tea houses I have been to in NYC, Cha-an probably has the best ambiance. It's a great place to bring a date (although I brought a friend) because the decor and lighting really adds to the quiescent experience and for the most part, the people around you are also trying to have that experience as well.My friend and I came in right when it opened, at noon, and were able to choose a seat that was away from the other tables. Our waiter was very kind and I have no complaints about the service.Because I came with a girlfriend, we decided to skip appetizers since we assumed there would be too much food. For drinks, my friend had the Lavender Mint Tea, which she enjoyed and I had the Iced Matcha Green Tea, which I had high hopes for, but didn't taste very good to me. My friend had the Cha-an Set B, which she said was interesting but she did not enjoy the potatoes. I ordered the Tea Smoked Salmon Toast, which I really loved!! The dish was very light even though it is served on a piece of toast. At first, I wasn't happy with my choice because it was difficult to eat since the crust of the toast was very hard and things just got very messy. But, because the salmon was so delicious, I can overlook that! My friend's Set B came with dessert with two options that we were not given and did not know about until we heard another waiter explain the set combo to a different customer. We were given a green tea gelatinous dessert, which I do not know the name of, that had dark colored syrup on top. It was an interesting dish but we were not satisfied. So, we ended up ordering the Black Sesame Creme Brulee because it was highly recommended. I was never a fan of black sesame and was skeptical about ordering it, but this dessert totally exceeded my expectations! It is a must-try!!
Shirley L.}Brooklyn, NY}143}230}738}18}2}6/6/2015}I was really excited to come here but the food and dessert was just so-so. The appetizers was not very appealing. The price of the food and dessert was so expensive and did not taste very good, probably will not come again :/.
Jieting C.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}0}5}5}-1}2}6/6/2015}The waiters here are the worst among all the Japanese restaurants, and that is A LOT! We went in at 4pm, it is not rush hour. 10 minutes after we sat down, still nobody came to ask for order. We waved 4 times to get somebody came over. After the order I would like to add some tea. Tadda! Again, we waved and waved to get somebody threw the menu down and went away. And of course, after we finished our dinner, nobody even bother to pay attention after 15 freaking minutes, while there are people lining up to get a table. What I could not believe is that they turned my tip back, leaving a note in my bill asking for 18% or 20%. I usually tip more than 20, but this time, sorry but no way I'm tipping you that much after all that waiting.The food is fine. Not exciting but not disappointing. PLEASE find some better servers. I'm not returning to this place again.
Ami P.}Los Angeles, CA}344}695}1768}-1}4}6/3/2015}Ugh the food here is so so so good. But man... The service in the beginning was so awful and the woman was in such a sassy mood and it definitely affected us but then our server changed mid way and he was extremely kind and attentive. We tried:1) 6 sample appetizer ($13)2) lunch special number one ($13)3) lunch special number two ($13)4) dessert sampler ($20)5) matcha smoothie ($7) All were so good and flavorful and the three of us were happily full :) it's a good place that you should definitely go to, but I don't think I need to go again~
Elizabeth Z.}Port Washington, NY}5}3}7}-1}1}6/2/2015}The food was good, but I'm very disappointed about their service. The bill is a little bit over $40, so we gave them $60 because we do not have the exact change. Then we waited very long time for the change, when I finally asked the waitress why we did not get our change back, the waitress showed me a surprised look, and said to me "oh so you expect your change?". I'm really shocked at her face expression, as if we are the rude ones to ask for changes. We always get our changes back first and then leave our tips, and even if your service is very decent(which is not), I still don't get why do you think you deserve a 50% tip. Not coming back.
Sharon M.}Brooklyn, NY}71}75}219}-1}2}6/2/2015}Extremely over price and you will not be full. The plates are around $28 each with extremely small proportion. The place is very small. The service is alright. The dessert is average. The one I order look like its pancake with red beans inside and with a scoop of ice cream. It wasn't really anything surprising.
Amy T.}Oakland Gardens, NY}35}33}1}-1}4}5/31/2015}Went here and bought the Chef's dessert special, matcha special, honey oolong tea, and a final dessert with sweet pancakes, red bean paste, strawberries, and red bean ice cream. The service was very quick but it didn't feel as if we were being rushed out. The set up and presentation of the orders was pretty. There was a black sesame theme for the dessert special with it in the cookies, ice cream, and creme brule. That was the best and most worthwhile aspect of the experience. There is an extensive list of teas that I would love to try, but at a much higher cost than I could afford to come frequently. Cha An is a place for special, imagined desserts but it's not worth the price (especially for our last dessert order).
Isabella M.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}5/26/2015}I went there today with my friend and  I don't know her name but it's a woman who works there. SHE HAS A SHORT HAIR AND SHE WEARS GLASSES. DOES anyone know HER ?  when I first went upstairs she said they were not ready so i went down and waited. Another employee a guy came down and he changed theSign to the open sign and he told me it was open and I may go in. So I went upstairs again and she was super rude. She seemed annoyed. She was like i said we are not ready yet. We have to prepare. I asked her very politely if it is okay to sit on the bench and wait. Because it was over 2pm which is the opening hour. Without saying sorry and without any smiles, she said no, you have to go outside and wait.Seriously, she was super rude! I came down and asked the guy if it was not open yet. He was baffled and told me that he would go up and check with her. After 30 seconds, he came down and he said we may go up.But 30 seconds ago, she said they were notReady and now they were ready? Was she trying to make a joke or something? I don't find that funny at all. I THINK THAT GIRL HAD TO BE FIRED.  Or you really have to educate your employees how to treat their customers!My friend and I were very very upset. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I was just super upset today because cha an is my favorite place. And she ruined my day!TERRIBLE.
Kwen Y.}Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY}0}23}4}-1}1}5/23/2015}me and my friend went there last night and it was packed. we tried to have them take our names down so we can come back. and their staffs kept going back and forth; they passed by, saw us standing there but just pretended we dont exist. one of you can at least greet us first and tell us to wait a moment yo!!! I went there only once before and had good impression but after what happened last night, i am not going back again!
Henry S.}Walnut, CA}158}2}0}-1}1}5/22/2015}I don't usually write reviews but I just have to for this one.  Service is very poor.  The waiter first gave us the menu and never came to us. I had to walk to the counter to ask to order food, for every single water refill, for reminder to serve dessert, and for check.  When ordering food, they don't remind their customers that it's a cash-only restaurant. (It's a basic thing to do if your restaurant is expensive and cash-only.) So, after lunch I had to walk several blocks away to get cash from ATM while they withheld my ID as ransom.  The food is extremely tiny but quite expensive.  Do yourself a favor and do NOT come to this restaurant.
Chae Won L.}San Diego, CA}1}1}1}-1}5}5/21/2015}Staffs are so friendly and kind! The dishes tasted fantastic too. A bit pricey but definitely worth it:D You can taste real Japanese food here!
Love R.}Philadelphia, PA}223}11}5}-1}5}5/13/2015}My second most favorite dessert place in NYC. The dinner meals are simple and very very delicate. The restaurant looks like an authentic tiny fancy Japanese coffee shop. And the desserts are soooo delicious and pretty. I don't have a favorite dish there because everything tastes equally amazing!
Hnde E.}Manhattan, NY}50}28}0}-1}4}5/6/2015}I have been to Cha-An a couple fo times for tea and desert, and everytime I left satisfied. like the atmosphere of this place, and the presentations of their deserts. However, there is always a wait of at least half an hour..
Jacky Y.}Woodside, NY}31}72}40}-1}4}5/5/2015}This is my second time coming to Cha-An. My friend didn't want the typical cake/bread type of desserts that were offered at Spot and ChikaLicious Dessert Bar (plus the wait time look like more than an hour) we decided to go here. Plus she wanted a more "Asian" dessert. Not going to lie, the wait time for this place was like 30 minutes as well (It's Friday night, so of course it's going to be busy). Food: I ordered the Oolong tea (I forget which one) and my friend ordered Chamomile because she didn't want any caffeine in her system at night. We ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and something anmitsu. The anmitsu was a red bean soup kind of thing and it had cut up cold mochi so it's like a mixture of hot and cold which is pretty good. The black sesame creme brulee was excellent as well.For the tea, they come up with this elaborate way of serving the tea. They pour the hot water in the pot with the tea leaves then pour that onto another cup and so forth. I probably don't have enough appreciation for tea but the things they did might as well be sorcery and I wouldn't care. I just wanted my tea...Decor: The place is very clean but a little tight. I feel like they could've done more to utilize their space but it's still nice. The service was alright, nothing to complain about really. Final thoughts: I think this is a nice place in the east village to have a nice conversation after a meal. There is a good amount of desserts options available and it's not a quiet place where people will be overhearing your conversation. Quite the opposite, it is pretty noisy/loud during Friday nights.
Kina L.}Atlanta, GA}70}330}472}18}4}5/2/2015}We stopped by after dinner for dessert. I honestly don't remember the name of the first dessert but it was essentially mochi suspended in red bean pudding. It was fantastic but pricey at almost $10. We also ordered the green tea latte with green tea ice cream topping. Cha An was a very initimte tea house and I would love to return for dinner.
Harriet J.}Richmond, Canada}123}14}2}-1}2}5/1/2015}They are incredibly over priced. Don't understand what the fuzz is about. The smoked salmon toast is good. The tea is alright. The good ends there. The service is horrible. There was a good employee but after he seated us we didn't see him again. The rest of the time they really tried hard to make us uncomfortable with their service to get us out of the store asap so they could take in more customers? The food and dessert are generally not so good seriously. The portion is extremely small and incredibly expensive for the service+food+environment. For two people i paid 130 plus tips for some dessert on my first trip here and second trip 110 for some tea and toast. Conclusion: NOPE
Stacy L.}Brooklyn, NY}3}7}17}-1}4}4/30/2015}I am obsessed with tea houses, tea lounges, tea anything. This little Japanese tea house located on the second floor fits the bill. It has a nice intimate atmosphere with dim lighting which makes it perfect to sip on tea with friends. We ordered the Matcha Tea Latte both hot and cold. The hot one comes in a bowl and you drink it with a soup so it kind of felt like a matcha tea latte soup. The iced one is very good as well and this comes in a normal glass cup. The desserts at this place is probably second to none. My favorite was probably the Black Sesame Crème Brule. Super tasty and great for sharing as well.
Dana C.}Edison, NJ}10}25}9}-1}5}4/27/2015}This is definitely one of my favorite tea houses in NYC. I love the Japanese decor, wide variety of teas, tasty desserts, and great service. It's a great place to catch up with friends because it's not too loud, you can order just a tea and not feel guilty, and sit for hours and hours - and no one will try to make you hurry up to pay and leave. I love that.I highly recommend the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. I definitely prefer this over regular Creme Brulee that can be too sweet somtimes.Also, don't forget this place is CASH ONLY!
Yuexin Z.}Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, NY}6}5}4}-1}4}4/25/2015}It is amazing!! Best dessert restaurant in NYC because I am really not into the cake with TONS of sugar. The dessert here is awesome but not too sweet at all!
A C.}Brooklyn, NY}1}103}26}-1}5}4/25/2015}Came here with a friend for a late lunch on Friday around 4PM. It was fairly busy but we got seats quickly.I ordered a tuna tataki which was tuna over rice with pickled vegetables an some lotus roots as a mini side dish. It may not seem like much but it was very filling. Food was delicious as well, it was flavorful and not bland at all. I also ordered a chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce and it wasn't something I enjoyed. It's not that it tasted bad but it was very sweet and too sweet for me. If you like chocolate and very sweet desserts, then it would be something you would enjoy. My friend ordered the black sesame creme brûlée which was a lot better IMO. One thing to note is the service. They're extremely attentive and they're very very nice. They don't rush you or hover over you. They also repeatedly come back to refill your cups of tea even when we could've just poured it ourselves. I would definitely come back again to try their other menu items. It can be a bit pricey, it was around 56$ for two people.
Scarlett Q.}Austin, TX}265}222}169}18}4}4/20/2015}Super busy, super crowded, super popular. The building is tiny; typical Japanese tea place. You get the idea: such a place in New York City, there is always a line.I've heard much about this place before I visited. Maybe that's why I had a pretty high expectation, and no wonder the reality crashed it after my visit. It's still a nice, with good Macha and dessert. But it's not that amazing. Just average.
Julia Z.}Raleigh, NC}43}205}704}18}3}4/19/2015}This place is so overrated. First thing first, just get the information out there: cash only, no reservations+tiny space=wait at the hallway even in the odd hour of the day. The service is okay, they cramped a bunch of small tables very close to each other so the waiters were quite busy, which means you will wait for your desserts/food. We ended up cancel one of our dessert and got the check, because we waited for a long time, and everything else ordered was finished. Back to the tiny space--I understand they want to make the maximum profit by seating as many tables as possible, but that means there's no privacy and it is not good for date, because all the tables are so close together: there was a first date couple siting next to us and they were hitting it off, good for them--but they start to get loud and personal and I really don't want to hear the details of their conversation...this is just not the quiet relaxing tea place I thought it would be, which is disappointing because I did enjoy the food and drink.
Jenna Leigh E.}Brooklyn, NY}4}59}0}-1}4}4/18/2015Updatedreview}Update #2....okay, service is getting better. Less like waiting for Godot, more like waiting for the Trans-Siberian Railroad to pull into the station. And the orders are coming out correctly, though you still might wait a long time between visits from your server. Still, the food is still first-rate. I'm hanging in there.
Cindy L.}New York, NY}119}333}728}-1}3}4/12/2015}You can come here for dinner or just dessert and both seems like great options.I came here for dessert on a Sunday evening and this place was packed. The entrance is way too small to accompany all the people coming in. Some people left after seeing the huge buildup at the top of the stairs.Service: Service was okay. I understand that it is packed but it would be nice if you just serve us water from the beginning instead of having us ask you for it.My friend got the sample platter which came with three desserts and I ordered a black sesame creme brulee. I was infatuated with the dessert but you will need water to wash it down afterward. Same goes for the other desserts. This place is a bit pricey but their desserts are good so it is definitely worth coming here at least once to give it a try.
Phillia Z.}New York, NY}0}19}3}-1}5}4/12/2015}The seasame brûlée is amazing！real home made taste! So are their homemade mochi. Incredible combination of black tea and chocolate!
Tina C.}Cambridge, MA}4}2}8}-1}4}4/12/2015}I enjoyed an excellent meal here at Cha-An -- I opted for their bigger dinner set. They will not seat you until your whole party arrives because the space is so small and popular. Service is very gracious though our server did not understand much English. They were very accommodating with my shellfish allergy however, and the dish that replaced the shrimp was actually my favourite: smoked mackerel! The thing I really like about Cha-An is how delicate yet simple and wholesome the whole meal was -- no pretentious gimmicks at five star restaurants, just good, clean food in small portions that is delicately yet perfectly prepared, with just the right amount of seasoning. What most surprised me was the fried tofu -- I normally hate fried foods because of how heavy and greasy they are, but they somehow made this so light and silky smooth it was absolutely impossible to not finish the whole plate (granted there were only 2 pieces). I don't normally eat rice, but the rice here is cooked very well, a bit sticky, wonderfully chewy and flavourful, a tiny bit of sweetness, much better than your average white rice.Cha-An is known for dessert, but unfortunately that wasn't the highlight for me this time -- from the set menu choices I went for a green tea mousse, while my friend had a deconstructed brownie cake in a glass with almond slivers and some sort of raspberry compote on the bottom and a dab of raspberry ice cream on top. My mousse was fine (not a big fan of mousse in general though), and my friend says her dessert was good. Next time I'll have to try that black sesame everyone keeps raving about though, I suspect I'll love that much more.Overall, Cha-An is an excellent choice for a light, clean, simple dinner that is very well made and well balanced. I would definitely came here again.
Kevin C.}New York, NY}1495}745}1694}18}3}4/10/2015}The ambiance of the restaurant is very tradtional and makes me feel like i'm in japan. Friendly service but a bit tiny space. Definitely come here for the desserts. As they have a great thick toast black sesame with red bean dessert and a mochi icecream parfait. It does have rice crispies on the bottom. I rated it 3 stars as it is a bit pricey. Green tea was expensive for a drink.
Steph V.}Los Altos, CA}122}345}37}18}2}4/9/2015}This is a very small teahouse in the East Village that if you don't look for, you could miss it. In addition to an extensive and impressive tea selection, they have both savory and sweet things here. My sister and I came here on a late Saturday night, and we put our name down for a 40 minute wait. That is pretty ridiculous, but it's a really tiny place upstairs, so expect to wait a while. My sister ordered the black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream. She enjoyed it. The presentation was really lovely. I ordered the red bean toast (this place seems like they are known for their toast since there are both sweet and savory toast options). I thought it was okay...the red bean was good, but I thought the toast was too buttery. I did like that it wasn't too sweet, though. Again, it was a lovely presentation.Overall, I would come back here maybe to have a savory meal or to drink tea. It's definitely a little on the pricier end at $9-11 for each dessert.
Vivian N.}New York, NY}1}16}251}-1}5}4/8/2015}Desserts are so good.....Black Seasame Creme Brulee is must, rich black seasame flavor creme brulee with a layer of crispy  caramel with smooth ice-cream, texture complemented well.Jasmine Tea ice cream.... better than expected because it is  fresh, light flavor.
Rhea R.}Manhattan, NY}23}15}39}-1}4}4/8/2015}Love the desserts here. I ordered the eel lunch special, the texture of the eel and the favor of the spice go so well together. Definitely coming back to try out other things.
Khalid A.}North Miami, FL}0}46}5}-1}5}4/7/2015}Wow a real gem tucked away - simple but tasty food, kind service. A real taste of Japan.
Al L.}New York, NY}0}86}69}-1}3}4/5/2015}Great atmosphere. Well crafted tea and desserts. Group for quiet hang out. A bit pricey. Enjoyable once-and-a-while experience.
Wenn P.}New York, NY}1}18}9}-1}4}4/5/2015}Black sesame mochi is the bomb diggity. Didn't have a tea but my companions said it was good.
Lynda N.}San Jose, CA}70}10}0}-1}4}4/4/2015}Wow, first I got to say, the pricing for each of the items on their menu are expensive!After visiting Japan, I was craving for Japan's unique and beautiful parfaits for a long time. Knowing that I'll be visiting Manhattan for two days, I decided to research up a restaurant or place that sells Japanese parfaits, and I found Cha-An! The images of the Berry Parfait and the Green Tea Parfait on Yelp and on Cha-An's website made me super excited to stop by, even if the price was expensive.When I finally got to Cha-An, the set up of the place was small and crowded, but it was beautiful and had the feel of a Japanese tea house. When I finally got to order my Green Tea Parfait, it was delicious (and the set up of the parfait was beautiful), but it didn't meet my expectation of the parfaits I bought in Japan (which were around $6-$10). Still, I enjoyed eating my parfait, from the Green Tea ice cream on top, to the mochi balls on the side, to the crunchy cereal on the bottom. おいしいだよ！My cousin, on the other hand, got the Sesame Creme Brulee, and he didn't enjoy it as much as he wanted it (he said his mistake was choosing a sesame flavor to begin with).I probably would not go to Cha-An too often because of the price, but it's a great place to try out once in a while :)
Averill G.}New York, NY}134}20}0}-1}5}4/4/2015}I really enjoyed Cha-An. It'll seem a little pricey for the amount of food that you get but the quality and fresh ingredients make it all worth it. Plus I actually found myself surprisingly full after the meal. Probably because rotating through all the small dishes made me eat slower than I usually do haha. I think I got a pretty authentic Japanese meal experience - simple, clean, and satisfying. The decor is accurately described in many of the other reviews. A cozy second floor walkup, there isn't too much seating but has the feel of a calming mid-sized tea/coffee shop. It's a great place to sit, have a quite chat, and nibble away at some tasty treats. They should have a set menu with pre-selected paired items if you're unsure of what goes well together. I went for lunch last summer (it's been a while haha) and thought it was great!
Ray C.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}0}12}18}-1}5}3/30/2015}This is the second time I come. Last time I tried the tasting menu is wasn't very that good. This time I order a la charte dessert
Rhea S.}San Diego, CA}182}151}391}18}5}3/29/2015}I like this place a lot, and I'm mad I never knew about this spot. Thanks to my friend who chose this place for us to have tea. I was craving a Matcha Latte and Cha An is the definite place for it. The place itself is located on the second floor and when you step in, I felt like I was in Japan all over again. The ambiance, decor and people were very welcoming. I especially loved the decor which was adorn with bamboo. The table we sat at was adorable, it was a booth that was like a little hut made by bamboo.
David C.}West Melbourne, FL}0}78}40}-1}3}3/24/2015}Bit overpriced, but the selection of teas is phenomenal, and the deserts are good too. I would recommend to go for tea and desert, but not for dinner. make it an after dinner place. also the decor and atmousphere is relaxing, artsy and quaint. However take away a star for the small dining room and long wait for a table.Overall, if i wanted a place for a gourmet meal, this is not it. but if I just want a small place to hang out and relax with tea and finger deserts, and I was in the area, I might suggest.
Christine V.}Mesa, AZ}261}305}132}-1}3}3/23/2015}East Village has some solid dessert places around, and Cha An is one of them.I came here on a Saturday night after dinner and had to wait around 40 minutes for a seat here. The ambiance of the place is lovely and really resembled a serene Japanese tea room, which is great considering Cha An serves both tea and food. Their menu is not huge, but they do offer dinner sets that lets you try a little bit of everything from their menu including side dishes, an entree, and a dessert. I ended up ordering the black sesame creme brulee, which also came with black sesame ice cream. Their black sesame flavor was good, but it does get overwhelming after a while since there is a lot of black sesame flavor that came with both the creme brulee and ice cream. Black sesame lovers would love it though. While I did enjoy it, I do think the desserts are fairly overpriced at around $9-$10 for each dessert. Overall, it is a fancy dessert place, and they offer unique blends of Asian desserts that I have not seen elsewhere.
Juan L.}New York, NY}56}22}0}-1}4}3/22/2015}They have a wide variety of teas. They're served with some type of special water, but I forget what. If you're looking for an extraordinary tea experience, this is your place. I would also recommend the mochi balls for dessert.
Jamie Y.}Bay Area}168}331}8}-1}5}3/18/2015}I had dinner + dessert with 2 of my girlfriends here and I absolutely enjoyed every course I had, including the tea!This is a quaint and romantic little place, perfect for dates and some much-needed girl time. I love the portions of the little dinner sets - great variety of sides, with your main staple. The flavors of from the pickled vegetables to the grilled fish came together harmoniously. Very authentic and wonderfully balanced.Now to the desserts! I absolutely love Asian flavors, especially when it's fused with different textures and cultural styles. Take for example, the black sesame creme brulee! I've had green tea creme brulee, but never black sesame! The creme brulee had several layers that added a sophisticated taste including the crunch of the sesame crisp on top and the ice cream.The passionfruit pudding was amazing as well - tarty, not overly sweet, and was perfect in richness. Desserts that complement a balanced dinner without overwhelming my taste buds is the best I can ask for!
Xiaojuan L.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}3/15/2015}The service is so bad. At beginning, the waiter lead us to a small room which separate from main area. Then, we have been waiting for long time and no one comes. Almost Every time we need service and Waiters never come, so we have to stand up and go out to looking for somebody.We felt inconvenient. So we gave them 10% tips. A waitress asked us why and we told her this, however she said"never come back"to us.
Thomas C.}San Francisco, CA}54}651}189}18}5}3/14/2015}This place has an amazing selection of Japanese desserts. Their menu doesn't picture their best dessert of all: Hojicha Anmitsu. It contains firm jelly, vanilla/matcha ice cream, red beans, brown sugar and special Mochi. The dessert by itself can get a little sweet -- the really nice thing here is that they have a large selection of teas as well. The Sencha green tea is very earthy and went very well with the dessert. We had to ask the waitress to fill the tiny tea pot several times though since it only pours two cups. Ask them to not add the brown sugar if you don't want the dessert to be that sweet.
Wenting T.}Manhattan, NY}2}14}0}-1}5}3/12/2015}The chocolate souffle and black sesame creme brulee... oh my. It's been a month seen I went, and the warm, creamy deliciousness still lingers on my tongue. Must have. And tea is a perfect compliment to the dessert.
Dianne N.}Scranton, PA}16}46}36}-1}4}3/12/2015}Tried their green tea. Very aromatic and original which I like and appreciate very much. Would love to try their dessert next time! Staffs are friendly and welcoming.
Sonny T.}Brooklyn, NY}2}57}3}-1}5}3/11/2015}Wonderful place and perfect relaxing place to just sip on a tea and enjoy the moment with friends or bring a special someone.
Kathryn M.}New York, NY}18}29}5}-1}5}3/11/2015}DELICIOUS tea and the smoked salmon toast was amazing. Fantastic ambiance and tea refills.
Jack C.}Richmond, CA}62}24}12}-1}5}3/10/2015}Nice tea nice dessert. Didn't try their savory foods. Simple and great place for an after-dinner relaxer.
Timothy O.}Manhattan, NY}236}54}3}-1}5}3/8/2015}If you like Japanese tea,  you must try cha-an!  The atmosphere is authentic and the tea is perfect to Japanese style.  A great selection of teas,  prepared just as you find in Japan.  Staff demonstrates traditional Japanese hospitality.  CASH ONLY.
Lils Y.}Manhattan, NY}191}231}175}-1}4}3/7/2015}Love Cha-An's unique blend of desserts and the relaxed/calming feel to the restaurant.Had the:- Raspberry butter toast- which was whipped creamy with the perfect amount of jam and the best blend of sweet toast. If you are a dessert lover like me and want an excuse to count dessert at dinner, this is IT.- Everyone gets the black sesame creme brulee ice cream, which meant I had to try it out too. Not a huge sesame gal, but somehow this works. I liked it, but yet I wouldn't get this again because I don't love sesame (unless it's oil). In the moment, it worked. My friends loved it though.- Service was extremely friendly, polite but forgetful. Did not have to wait more than 30 min for a seat for 3 on weekend afternoon. I would def. come back.
Ros W.}Manhattan, NY}36}11}224}-1}5}3/5/2015}one of my all time favorite places to go to in the city. authentic Japanese desserts and tea as long as "light" dinners. lovely little place in Astor place and one where you'll fall in love the first time you try it!red bean toast is amazing if you're up for a bigger dessert. If you're there with a group of friends try the dessert sampler. all of their tea is great. my fave is the iced matcha that comes with a spoonful of azuki beans  perfect match!cash only tho and they are a wee bit pricey so remember to get enough cash beforehand.
Jackie M.}Chicago, IL}232}344}1117}-1}5}3/3/2015}I came here in a cold winter late night for dessert. Its located in the 2nd floor and the interior design is more of a rustic Japanese tea room. Very cute and cozy. I ordered the ssesame creme brulee which also comes with sesame ice cream. I loooove it and i love sesame!! It's the ultimate combo. The parfait looks pretty and it was good. The other homemade ice cream was jasmine ice cream. We ordered two chrysanthalum tea, but knowing that it comes in a generous teapot. FYI , one order is enough for 3 people to sip the tea. The tea was light and refreshing. The flavor was light, but it was there. I read the menu and the tea is brewed by some special water. Interesting...
Matthias S.}Manhattan, NY}19}7}1}-1}5}3/3/2015}Cha-An (I am no linguist but I think it means meditation,contemplation) is a Japanese-style teahouse in the East Village. The place is small and on Monday evening when I went, it wasn't too busy. We were two, got seated promptly, and embarked on a culinary journey over two hours. The teas were smooth, as supposedly Cha-An even improved the famous New York's finest tap water as they claim to filter and purify it. I had the Honey Phoenix Oolong Tea, which comes in a ceramic kettle. All that was missing was Cheshire Cat to sit down with us and grin ear to ear. At first my tea didn't taste much of anything but after a few more sips it started to grow and dawn on me that the flavors are very subtle. A very smooth, quiet experience, a escape from the loud and in-your face exposures of NY. You need to be patient to drink that tea. For a little bite, we had the Tea-Smoked Salmon Toast, the size of a small brick and plenty to share for two. The savory dressing, salmon and leaves, were a balanced combination enough to string us over to the Dessert Chef's Sampler. That comes in fives dishes and the Yukimi Zenzai was our favorite especially the red bean porridge. Just writing about this makes my mouth salivate again. Sorry for the drools. If I were a dessert in my next life, I want to be reborn as a Cha-An dessert. Om...
Cecilia L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}10}0}-1}4}3/2/2015}Went here with a friend. The place is small but zen, pretty crowded. We had waited for 15 mins on the stairs. The green parfait tastes good. I like green tea or matcha favor. It is definitely a good place for tea time and for chatting with friends.
Di P.}Philadelphia, PA}289}432}129}-1}4}3/2/2015}DESSERT REVIEW!Green tea jelly??? black syrup??? red been porridge?? black sesame creme brulee?? Yeah. if you haven't had these flavors before I can see why you'd stick to tea and maybe mochi cuz you've at least had that once before. But being half Filipino I had no problem diving in and then having my less adventurous friends try what I had. Honestly, all the desserts were SO GOOD. My favorite was the Hojicha Anmitsu with the green tea jelly and sweet black syrup. It also had green tea ice cream in it and mochi. The jelly itself was really subtle and the syrup was a great counter balance. We had mixed reviews about the teas--some of my friends felt like their teas were really weak. My tea was delicious although the most I've paid for tea-- Honey Phoenix. SO tasty. No sugar needed. There was a wait as this place is really popular, but I'm glad I waited! Enjoyable!
Alexandra K.}Brooklyn, NY}18}7}7}-1}4}3/1/2015}Good place to have quick tea and try Chinese desserts and snacks. As per price, it is affordable. Tasty tea variations. I recommend to try lemon-verbena tea.
Yi C.}New York, NY}2}5}11}-1}4}3/1/2015}I love the matcha drink. The mochi is super hard and totally not chewy at all... And the waiting time is supper long, even at 10pm
Hui C.}Manhattan, NY}324}249}114}18}4}2/28/2015}Super cute place, tasty desserts. Overpriced but the ambience and food make up for it. Also open until 12am! Would recommend the chocolate souffle; lemon verbena tea smelled kind of like bathroom cleaner, so maybe not
Steven J.}New York, NY}6}180}0}-1}2}2/26/2015Updatedreview}No reservations = no thanks. Who wants to wait an hour in the cold for tea! This place is less of a tea house, like Boise or The Russian Tea Room, and more like a really boring Izakaya.
Johnson W.}Brooklyn, NY}83}29}7}-1}1}2/24/2015}This review goes back to Saturday Feb 21st around 3:30pm. My friend and I decided to try out Yakiniku West but found out the place didn't open yet. Derp, stupid us didn't check before going there. So I told her to go look to see if Cha-An is open since she has been wanting to go there for their cute desserts and set lunches. When we got there, there was no waitress/waiter around to greet/ seat us. So we waited a while and then the WAITRESS said "we are full" and walked away. I'm here thinking...uh well are you going to tell me how long the wait is or least take down how many people I have and tell us to wait. I GUESS NOT. From the look of it the place looks tiny, unless there is a back side to it, place was dark, not sure if they were too cheap to turn on lights or trying to pull some dim light romantic theme. Also it did not look like there was a place for customers to stand and wait for a free table. OH WAIT, I never even had a chance to wait so I'm not sure if people wait on the stairs or some area. In conclusion, thank you rude waitress for turning away customers. I am glad because I saved my money for some place better. Not to mention they charge an arm and leg for their food...yeah I can get a whole box of mochi at the Chinese supermarket instead.
Koty W.}Newark, NJ}131}64}108}18}4}2/23/2015}Cha-An is a quaint little Japanese tea house located in the East Village. It is known for its dessert and unique setting in Manhattan. In addition to dessert, Cha-An has small meals, teas, and a short list of sake and beer.We came 40 minutes before closing and the staff there informed us we would only have 40 minutes to dine and if that would be ok. We gladly obliged and took our seats. This was a Sunday night, so the teahouse was almost fully sat, but there was no wait for a table. From other reviews it seems that this place gets pretty busy, but I guess no one comes here right before closing.Because we just ate dinner before this, we only wanted to get dessert and tea. I ordered the Yukimi Zenzai, which is a mochi ice cream with sweet red beans. My companion kept it simple with the homemade jasmine tea and green tea ice cream. She also put in an order for a pot of tea. I was not present during ordering so I can't say how well the staff took our order, but I can vouch for the very neat bathrooms they had.The pot of tea came first with two cups, which were filled by our waiter. The pot of tea literally only had enough boiling water for only two cups, so after we finished our first cup of tea, we asked for more boiling water. If might be wise to get separate orders of tea if you want multiple cups.Shortly after the tea arrived, both our desserts came too! I was very impressed with the delivery of both these desserts. They were simple, but very aesthetically pleasing. Also, both dishes had a brown leaf on them, which was an elegant touch. I really enjoyed my dessert. The red beans were very sweet, much different from Chinese style red bean desserts. Also, it was warm, which gave a nice contrast to the coldness of the mochi ice cream. The mochi ice cream was not store-bought (hopefully), unlike many other Japanese restaurants that may serve mochi ice cream. I only had a small bite of the green tea and jasmine tea ice cream, but I was pretty satisfied with the taste. Not the best, but definitely different from the usual American ice cream. I would have to say the flavoring is less sweet and the texture was less creamy. Before I forget, I should add that I was not a fan of the little cookie they put on top.I believe most the workers here were Japanese, and they seemed very courteous. No attitudes were given to us even though we came close to closing. Our waiter even smiled a couple of times! I would have to say the menu is pretty expensive, but I wouldn't mind coming again! The ambiance is very simple, but it feels intimate. Maybe because people aren't yelling over each other to have a conversation. Side note: It is cash only, like many establishments in Manhattan (or Asian ones).*BonusThe bathroom has a bidet toilet for the female side.
Jane K.}Los Angeles, CA}153}91}37}-1}5}2/19/2015}love this place this place is so zen.and the tea does taste better. i need to come back and try their meals because i only came for tea and dessert.it is a tad bit expensive but their desserts are so good. like.. "shut up and take my money" good. i recommend their butter brick toast with raspberry. their whipped cream is really heavy, which i love. don't get it with ice cream, its too much.
Evelyn W.}Manhattan, NY}362}237}363}-1}5}2/18/2015}E-Scale: 9/10This place is fantastic. It's cash only and small, but it is totally worth it. Everything is authentic and I love going for lunch because of the little meal sets. The food is seasoned perfectly and the desserts are so so so good. One of my favorite places when I go down to the Astor Place area. If you go at off-peak hours it won't be as crowded.
Sophia T.}New York, NY}1}16}0}-1}5}2/16/2015}i love this place.. it feels like tokyo! the matcha latte is amazing.. the  desserts are really great . it is a perfect hideaway date night place. yummy!
Veena K.}Atlanta, GA}164}56}41}-1}3}2/9/2015}This place seems very authentic, but be warned it is very expensive and cash only. I went with a group so we each tried different teas and desserts. Beware, some of the the green teas are really really strong. The most interesting desserts were probably the sesame seed ice cream (lots of really cool textures going on there) and the toast, which was my favorite. You can tell a lot of thought went into crafting the deserts and this is definitely a high class foodie sort of place. Others in my group ordered food which looked delicious, but again pretty expensive. Again, everything was really authentic (according to the friends I was with who visit Japan regularly) but the high price bumps this down to 3 stars for me.
Jessica C.}Jersey City, NJ}8}10}3}-1}4}2/7/2015}This is one of my favorite places in the east village! The ambience is cozy and charming, but it gets crowded fast if you go during peak times. The tea varieties are well-presented and properly steeped and the staff are very polite. Other than the tea, it's great for small bites (try their salmon toast, the bread is soft and delicious) and dessert. They have cold sake and beer, but only 2 or 3 options..not very good ones..better stick to tea and dessert. Try their flan! The flavors change seasonally, but I can definitely vouch for the chestnut. It's a light dessert with just the right amount of sweetness and texture. The chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce is also good, but no where near the flan. I've also had the ice cream sandwich, but didn't care for the flavor of the outside sandwich bit..it tasted like a stale mini-pancake. This place is cash only, which I sometimes forget and end up having to cross the street to an ATM. Great place for tea and a chat with a friend..not a big group.
Crystal A.}Brooklyn, NY}170}161}508}-1}2}1/28/2015}Only exciting thing truly was the bathroom. The bathroom has Japanese toilets that have the capability of spraying and washing your bottom.From reading the Yelp reviews I had high expectations. Simply disappointed by the quickly made and poor quality food. Tasted like food I would expect to buy from a bowling alley not a Japanese tea house.
Allene T.}Manhattan, NY}2117}1285}2910}18}4}1/27/2015}If you'd rather spend a chill night with a girlfriend and chit chat over dessert and tea rather than go out to a loud, packed bar, Cha-An is your place.  As a dessert place, it's definitely somewhere you should save some room for during your dinner (I prefer Cha-An as a night place - have never been here during the day).I've been to Cha-An several times already and I have yet to be disappointed.  It's creative and delicious desserts always have me coming back for more.  It's not on the cheap end, thats for sure - most desserts range from $8 to $10.  On a busy evening (weekends), expect a possible wait.  It's dangerous because if there are no tables, you may be in for a decent wait since people are just hanging out, sipping on teas, and eating yummy desserts.If it's your first time and you're with at least one other person, I would suggest ordering the chef's sampler: it comes with five different "flights" of their most popular desserts.  It's usually come with red bean + mochi ice cream, tea cookies (matcha and chocolate) + black sesame creme brûlée, some sort of ice cream, and a seasonal dessert.They also have a wide selection of tea which you can order by the pot - ranges around $6 to $8 each.  I think you can also take loose leaf to go as well.  Refills are free and apparently they use "special" water... you can read about it in the menu.Great place for tea time and desserts with girlfriends!
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}4}1/25/2015}I like tea a little bit, I like small cramped quarters that remind me of Japanese pragmatism a lot, and I love any kind of dessert that will make the girls at the table next to me take a million photos to achieve that perfect Instagram photo. By the way, why is that? I'm usually fiending to take the first bite, shark-like, and I always think it takes massive amounts of patience to find the right angle and then the right filter/lighting/shading, so that when you're done and hit "Post," the ice cream in the photo doesn't look anything like the ice cream in front of you. Is it the next weight loss fad, where you take so many pictures until the ice cream melts or your dining partner eats it all? These girls might be on to something revolutionary. Deluxe matcha was fantastic - combine matcha, green tea ice cream, and the daintiest scoop of red bean paste. Mochi was just okay for almost $3 a pop. I know you're supposed to cut it up into slivers and then savor it with your tea like a civilized human being amidst a vigorous discussion on Nietzsche, but I just plopped it in my mouth while ruminating over how Kim K's butt broke the internet. Didn't get to try any of the savory dishes or the beloved toasts but they seemed kind of small for the price.  Cash-only. Their small cups for the cash are too big for any credit card to fit, a gentle but totally passive-aggressive reminder that this ain't the time and place for plastic. Look up for the sign.
Isabella Y.}New York, NY}6}6}1}-1}5}1/20/2015}Beautiful Asian teahouse decoration. Delicious & creative food. Exquisite deserts. Great place to meet up with a friends.
Cherry C.}Brooklyn, NY}87}49}43}-1}5}1/20/2015}This is a nice place for chatting and high tea. I went there on a Tuesday afternoon so it was not crowded at all. We ordered the salmon toast and the pork and taro appetizer. They provide lots of green teas, black, oolong, white, etc. The place is quiet and peaceful. Good for relaxing and warming oneself in cold weather.
Daisy L.}Brooklyn, NY}13}2}0}-1}4}1/18/2015}I've been here a couple of times with friends, and I love it! The place has a calming atmosphere and is a good place to catch up with a friend. I usually come here for dessert and tea after dinner. They have a pretty good selection of teas, it is served in a small pot but they refill the pot for you a couple of times. Last time I came here my friend and I ordered the sampler. We really enjoyed the black sesame ice cream and the black sesame creme brûlée. I didn't really enjoy the mochi with red bean, i thought it was too sweet.
Vic Q.}New York, NY}5}18}2}-1}4}1/17/2015}Great dessert. The black sesame creme brulee and mochi are both really good. A long wait though, and a little pricy for a "cash-only" place. Won't be able to afford very often. Will try their meals next time.
Ju L.}New York, NY}6}67}123}-1}4}1/17/2015}Very relaxing place with fantastic food and tea. I feel like their tea is not as fresh as it once was... but it is overall a great place. I go back often to get some genmaicha or try new teas. All of their dishes are great. Especially the smoked salmon toast.
Edward Y.}Manhattan, NY}554}11}102}-1}5}1/17/2015}Cha-An is one of those date spots that want to bring people to time and time again. It's slightly hidden, being on the second floor which adds to its charm and ambience. Once you get up the wooden stairs, you arrive at a cozy tea room, decorated simply and traditionally. They have a wide arrange of menu items with maybe around 50 types of tea! For food, they have bento boxes, and they're known for their smoked salmon toast. However, I usually come here for the dessert. The chocolate soufflé and black sesame crème brûlée are both impressive examples of well executed desserts. Not overly sweet, these desserts that are normally found at more expensive high end restaurants, have become more accessible thanks to Cha-An. The only downside of this place in my opinion is that it is cash only, but really that is just me being lazy and nit-picky.
Sophie C.}New York, NY}87}46}4}-1}5}1/12/2015}Great place to meet up with a friend. Tea's always satisfying. The meal sets are nice too, though some of the items may be acquired taste (picked items, lotus root etc). I personally like the rice the best - a nice mix of different kinds with unique texture and flavor that pairs nicely with tea - especially grain-y teas.Sometimes it's rather busy, and they won't seat you til everyone's there, so plan accordingly.
Aelita P.}Philadelphia, PA}306}279}551}18}3}1/12/2015}Atmosphere: Between the tatami matts, the TOTO in the bathroom, and the Japanese waiters/waitresses I felt like I was back in Japan. I really liked the atmosphere, and would probably go back for that alone.Tea/Dessert: We ordered green tea (I can't remember what kind) and it was very good albeit overpriced (I can buy green tea leaves for much much cheaper). We also got the black sesame creme brulee and the green tea parfait. The parfait was okay- mochi and green tea and black sesame cookie were good, but at the top it was just whipped cream and the bottom was just rice krispies and red bean. I guess I shouldn't have expected more, usually parfaits have similar ingredients, I just wasn't impressed/was a bit annoyed that it was so expensive given what was inside. The sesame creme brulee was really interesting, but a bit too sweet for my taste. I don't regret getting it, but I wouldn't order it again (if you LOVE black sesame and don't mind sugar, you'll like it).
Helen L.}New York, NY}129}130}34}-1}3}1/12/2015}Came here for dessert after dinner. It was between Cha-An or Spot, and Cha-An had a shorter wait. We didn't try anything other than the deluxe sampler and 4 different teas. The sampler was really small for what it cost and it definitely didn't blow my mind. The teas were alright, but also overpriced for basically one cup of tea that they kept adding hot water to. This wasn't a bad experience, but I wouldn't say it's a place I'd come back again and again to. It's overpriced and in NYC, you can find way better tea and desserts elsewhere.
Dio T.}Bronx, NY}0}4}1}-1}2}1/11/2015}I was originally going to give this place 1 star but the tea and food are too good and you should definitely check this place out but be warned! The space is beautiful, but our waiter was extremely rude! She expected a tip higher than 15%, which would be fine, if she deserved it. She also had the audacity to point out our tip wasn't sufficient. Now, i am a true believer in merit where it is deserved but it wasn't like she did anything out of the ordinary and my 10% met the standard. If you're in the area by all means check it out but I strongly  suggest the place across the street, better food and dessert by far!
Mike S.}Trenton, NJ}227}16}0}-1}2}1/11/2015}This place is overpriced for their teeny portion sizes and uncomfortable atmosphere.  A cup of Jasmine green tea is $6 (server brought an empty teapot along with my filled cup and then offered half an hour later to refill the teapot - why not just bring it out with hot water in the first place?).  Our party ordered stuffed mochi, a red bean and mochi tray, and a jelly and ice cream dessert.  All of the portions were drastically tiny.  Ice cream scoops were considerably smaller than ping pong balls but the desserts were well over $10.  Matcha and vanilla ice cream are not exactly gourmet so they could stand to give a bit more.  Below the restaurant is a club, and the floor of the restaurant shakes because of the loud music below.  What could be a relaxing place to have some snacks and tea becomes obnoxious as you watch your table bounce across the room.  As for the taste?  Fine.  Nothing to write home about but not bad.  You'd probably be just as satisfied getting dessert and tea at an Asian fusion restaurant for half the price.
Ben W.}New York, NY}516}773}435}18}5}1/11/2015}Tea time is my new favorite meal.Because of the rain last weekend, none of my friends wanted to go out. Fortunately, one of my friends was in East Village already and I suggested checking out Cha An. It had been on my list for a long time already and I figured what better day than today to drink a nice hot cup of tea.The wait was about 20 minutes and the host called me when our table was ready. The menu is fairly expansive, as they serve multiple entrees, types of desserts, and a pageful of tea. We had all already eaten dinner, so we settled on the chef's sampler dessert platter, an order of mochi, and two pots of teas.The platter was unbelievably beautiful. It had such balance and the presentation of each individual dessert created a masterpiece of sweets. Starting with my favorite, the black bean ice cream was heavenly. The initial black sesame flavor was very strong and it was followed by the creamiest cooling sensation. Three small scoops was nowhere near enough. The cookie on top was so crunchy and helped compound that black sesame flavor. The yukimi zenzai  was also quite tasty. The combination of the hot, pasty red bean and cold, chewy mochi ice cream created a nice contrast. The maple leaf garnish on top was also such a simple and creative touch.The creme brûlée was made really well, although the consensus was that the sesame flavor could've been stranger, especially when it shared the same plate as the ice cream. The tea cookies were very buttery and fell apart nicely. However the green tea flavor didn't really come out. The sponge cake was at the bottom of my list. It was perfectly light and paired well with the yuzu glaze, but it just paled in comparison to everything else on the platter.The mochi were a delight as well, although they were on the pricier end. The chocolate earl grey was hands down the best of the three.Service was impeccable. We only ordered two pots of tea for four people, but it was more than enough. The server kept coming back and refilling our cups. Despite only using one batch of tea per pot, the flavors were still there by our fourth round.This was a great alternative to drinking and dancing on a Saturday night. We talked for a long time and enjoyed some of the best tea and dessert service I've ever had. If you've never been, you must go. It's a cute little shop that deserves your business. Cha An is definitely on my list of favorites now.
kaaaathy c.}College Point, NY}383}34}215}-1}3}1/11/2015}My friend and I ordered the mochi ice cream in red bean porridge and the black sesame creme brûlée. They were really delicious! Unfortunately, I was disappointed at the quality of their service. They took awhile to take our orders and it was difficult waving down for a waiter.
Ben L.}Manhattan, NY}181}128}16}-1}1}1/6/2015}$8 for a cup of tea that tasted like nothing. NOT ABOUT THAT LIFE. Also, super uptight atmosphere. No thanks.
Rumi F.}New York, NY}224}273}67}18}5}1/5/2015}Guys I think I'm in love.... okay fine, maybe the warm, fuzzy feeling I have for the place is from the endless pots of beautiful genmai tea that warmed my core... or maybe its actually from their delicious Sunday lunch set I got to enjoy!(okay I'll stop being cheesy now)Stopped by with the BF on a drizzly Sunday afternoon- it was 2pm and really full. Go up the stairs and you enter a sweet Japanese-y tea house, filled with little tables (they even have a larger booth like structure in the back of the room)They have great set lunches that are different depending on the day. Since we went on a Sunday, the lunch set was a Soboro (ground chicken) rice bowl. The set is simple- savory soboro over mixed grain rice with edamae, shiso and egg, some pickled cucumber and pickled lotus root with mushrooms. However, it hit just the spot and still felt really healthy. The tea is made with great care and high quality ingredients- the lunch set comes with really nice genmai tea (with teapot refills!)We finished off with the mini dessert (an extra $3 to your $13 lunch set)- a citrus pound cake and passionfruit pudding. Perfect end to the meal.Cash only and you will wait! But definitely worth the experience. I'll be back to try other lunch sets!
Lizzy S.}Taipei, Taiwan}20}79}264}-1}1}1/4/2015}Normally, Japanese restaurants are famous for their nice service and good desserts. However, the service is terrible herem The waiters are so arrogant. The desserts are not worthy at all. Seven dollars for a small pot of mocha latte? Crazy! I am so regret of steping in. Warm suggestion: don't step in!
Sarah Z.}Brooklyn, NY}18}72}71}-1}3}1/2/2015}Came here for dessert after dinner. Pretty expensive for just dessert. It costed more than my dinner. It's a small place upstairs; if you blink, you just might miss it. I got the sampler which came with the sesame creme brûlée, and three other desserts. The creme brûlée was probably my favorite though. Nothing special, in my opinion. Actually, pretty disappointing after wanting to come here for a while.Also got the parfait. That was okay too. They also have a small food menu selection. Don't think I'd come back though.
Princess Lindsay P.}Manhattan, NY}18}72}15}-1}5}12/27/2014}This is the cutest desert place ever. Everything is as good small size. Pretty shareable. Very well made deserts. Great atmosphere. The wait is okay.
Shirley C.}Manhattan, NY}158}94}14}-1}3}12/27/2014}3.5 stars, IMO. Cha An has an excellent selection of teas and desserts with intricate flavors (not to mention a super cool Japanese toilet). There are some "rules" of the teahouse that I'm not a fan of -1)  $6 minimum per guest (which is easy to reach because everything on the menu is $6 at the minimum, even for 1 cup of tea) and 2)  guests who order tea are only allowed to sit for 1 hour before kicking you out. I mean, I know you are a relatively small place with a lot of patrons, but it tickles me the wrong way when paying customers are kicked out. Our server noticed we only ordered tea and brought the dessert menu to us after 1 hour and asked if we were ordering desserts and if not, we had to GTFO. This "rule" didn't make a very good impression on my friend who was visting from D.C. I've been here multiple times to try their desserts and I'm a fan of the black sesame creme brulee and earl grey tea. Paying $12 for a cup of matcha sounds a little too $$$ for me. Even though my cup of matcha cost more than a $9 dessert, they still kicked us out. It just makes me want to go back, order a $8 dessert and sit for 2 hours.. So yes, Cha An is just A-Ok to me.
C K.}Bellerose, NY}0}4}15}-1}4}12/24/2014}Had the lunch special with desert.  Friendly service and the place is very clean.
nina b.}Manhattan, NY}35}80}46}-1}5}12/24/2014}This is a very tradition tea house. The serve traditional Japanese food, so if your looking for something Americanized it's not here. I love the dessert and and the wide variety of Japanese teas that fill up an entire book. This is a hole in the wall place. But if ur ever missing japan it's a great place to call ur own.
Yang C.}Jersey City, NJ}9}14}0}-1}4}12/23/2014}Ordered Cha-an Set B with homemade tofu, tea smoked salmon, 15 grain rice, combination of vegetables, a daily side fish. Had chef's dessert assortment for dessert. Very healthy but portion is small.
Kevin J.}Manhattan, NY}653}244}1045}-1}4}12/22/2014}Cha-An is a cozy hidden tea and desserts shop near Union Square. It has a really intimate environment and a wide selection of teas, desserts, and savory snacks. However, real emphasis on the diversities of teas, their list just goes on and on. I'm a fan of Green tea, so whenever I have the chance to try a new type of green tea, I'm down. They even give you your own small teapot whenever you order the tea, and I'm assuming you can ask them to refill the hot water within the pot as well. I've tried two of their food selections before. On one occasion, we had the tea-smoked salmon toast which was absolutely sumptuous. The smoked salmon was so tender, and the toast was a kind of Japanese style, with crispy baked golden exterior and a fluffy white interior. Honestly, the snack was to die for. On the second occasion, we ordered a dessert called black sesame creme brulee. It was super rich, and very unique. I've only known of Black sesame to be used frequently in Asian cooking, particularly in asian desserts and sweet snacks. This was a very interesting twist and I definitely enjoyed it. The dessert and chip on the top blend together quite nicely. If you're looking for a quiet place to chat, drink tea and have some desserts with a friend, I'd definitely recommend Cha-An!
Pauline L.}Staten Island, NY}196}55}132}-1}4}12/21/2014}Walked in on a Sunday night and the wait was around 20 min .Black sesame creme brule - MY FAVE,  loved the consistency !!! Definitely recommend ,,Deluxe green tea matcha- not that sweet so it compliments the desserts wellGreen tea parfait- loved the glutinous mochi balls but the rest of the parfait was mediocre Definitely will come back to try their tea !
Roger H.}Jamaica, NY}429}199}695}18}3}12/21/2014}decor was nice and tried to emulate a japanese tea house. The food was okay, was not anything special, i ordered the salmon toast and the desert sampler. The salmon toast although a pretty unique idea, was pretty bland and consisted mostly of bread. The best thing about this establishment was the deserts and their use of traditional asian ingredients such as sesame, taro, red bean, matcha, infused with clearly very western deserts. If you enjoy a fusion desert themed restaurant that really is incredible cutesy and gimmicky, this might be a place for you to try. Nothing really blew me away, everything was decent at best here
Nathaniel L.}Flushing, Queens, NY}74}80}178}-1}4}12/21/2014}Cha-an is one of my favorite places to get dessert in St. Marks.  It's like entering into a whole different realm.  The decor is really zen and relaxing.  Was kind of sad that this time I went to Cha-an, they had changed their menu and the green tea roll with amasake ice cream was taken off.  That was one of my favorites.  So this time, I went for the mochi set and the seasonal flan.  For the mochi, you have a choice of earl grey chocolate, black sesame, or matcha.  You can mix and match.  The earl grey chocolate was awesome--very chocolaty with a slight infusion of earl grey flavor.  The matcha had strong matcha flavor too, but wasn't quite as smooth as the chocolate mochi.  The mochi skin on one or two of them was a bit tough, so it probably wasn't made fresh.  I've had better mochi, but Cha-An isn't too bad either.  The seasonal flan this time just seemed to have been a plain flan with red bean paste on the side.  Like always, the flan is silky, jiggly, and a little sweet.  Paired with the red bean paste and it's quite sensational.Waiters are friendly and all but sometimes it tastes a bit long to get their attention.P.S-CASH ONLY.
Jon L.}Houston, TX}262}159}464}18}5}12/17/2014}I love cha-an!The ambiance is so peaceful and calming. The waiters are experts in the teas and will guide you to the tea that will best fit how you are feeling. The green teas taste fresh and almost have a grassy nature taste to them. Sipping on their green tea was like sitting in a green valley under blue skies. But the real must have here is the sesame creme brûlée. Seriously one bite changed my life. The caramel had a crunch before the soft silky cream. I've never had something so good. Eat slowly so it doesn't go away! The last bite is the saddest.
Robert M.}Manhattan, NY}9}8}47}-1}5}12/14/2014}Owned and operated by 100% Japanese. I have been coming here on occasion for over 10 years and it has always been high quality. Located right in the middle of Japan town, near the Astor place station, so it's very convenient.
Carmen L.}Daly City, CA}38}11}4}-1}1}12/12/2014}Review purely on the service. So my friends and I came here around 8pm on a Friday night and requested a table for 6. We did notice that the restaurant was slightly small and had concerns for our relatively large party. The hostess told us 45 minutes and that they will call when our table was ready. We walked around East Village for about 20 minutes and decided to just wait in the mini staircase/waiting area. Around the 45 minute mark, I checked in with the host and he said that the table was not ready yet and estimated another 20 minutes, which was understandable. As we proceed to wait, we saw latter smaller parties enter and were promptly seatly. Again, this was understandable. About an hour and a half into our wait, we were not given any updates of our status, more latter parties were seated, and the parties that were seated before were nearing the end of THEIR meals. When I checked in with the host he told me he did not know how much longer and walked away mid conversation while I was trying to explain our frustration of waiting almost 2 hours with no hope of getting a table soon and how latter parties were already finished with their dining experience while we still dont know when we would get our table. We promptly left after the host walked away.We were very understanding of the circumstances. If you can't seat 6 in a small establishment, then tell us. We are reasonable beings. Do NOT give us false hope of a table and just disregard us for about 1.5 hours. Needless to say, this is the worse restaurant service I have ever recieved. The food would have to be life changing delicious for me to even consider giving this establishment a 2nd chance.
Anna J.}Elmhurst, NY}155}80}153}-1}4}12/11/2014}I was here 2 months ago.  It was a place I wanted to check out for a while and it was part of my deal with my date. We decided to take each other to places we have been to and the other person has not gone to but has always wanted to go. It was his turn first. We decided to meet 6-ish on a weekday.  I decided to arrive a little early and found the place just fine. I  was surprised how unnoticeable it was from the outside. Once my date arrived,  we went up the stairs. It wasn't big but it was just right for an intimate dinner. The place had a warm and peaceful atmosphere. The moment we reached the top of the stairs we were welcomed by a nice lady who seated us right away.  The place was surprisingly quite empty.As I flipped through the menu,  I had already decided what I wanted to order. My date suggested we get Hojicha tea if I was in the mood for some tea. I'm always down for some tea so we ordered it. The tea had a roasted flavor to it. It was different from the teas I ever had. As for the food,  I think I  ended up picking our food which he didn't mind at all. (10 being the best) Red Bean Butter Toast with Jasmine Tea - 7/10Plating was nice. It was quite sweet and the Jasmine tea was a nice light blend. Quite filling alone. Black Sesame Creame Brulee- 6/10Plating beautifully done. You really have to like Black Sesame to order this.  I think,  my date liked it more than me.  Creame Brulee part was okay. Maybe I had high hopes on this one due to the yelp comments. Green tea parfait- 8/10This is the dessert to order.  I think all the ingredients in this was a nice blend. Sweet level was just right. Would I come here again? Maybe.  I think if you come here for desserts and tea you'll be satisfied. Are there better places to go then here... Most likely.
Flavia A.}Santa Monica, CA}299}299}286}18}5}12/10/2014}This is me gushing about Cha-An. :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-DWhat a delightful little place! The interior is decorated like what I imagine a Japanese tea house would look like. Lots of dark wood and screens. The servers are from Japan and very helpful and friendly. We had an AMAZING dessert to share: mochi drizzled in sweet red beans, topped with a japanese sweet and a maple leaf. It was utterly perfection. We also each ordered a pot of tea. And they have lemon verbena...rare for me to find!So, I'm in love. I'm going back. And I'm telling everyone I know about it.
Ruobin W.}Stony Brook, NY}237}801}128}18}5}12/8/2014}The mochi was good, the filling was alright. That was really the only disappointing part of the snack experience. I think it's worth the price if you just remember how good it all tastes and that you can get free refills on the tea. I got the Uji kabusecha and it was a great green tea. Grassy and delicious. However, the most amazing thing was the black sesame creme brulee. I don't think anything will top this dessert  in any japanese tea house.
S Y.}Manhattan, NY}2}15}0}-1}4}12/7/2014}Love this little place.  I'm transported back to Japan whenever I come here.  I love their daily specials and their deserts are divine, not too sweet and seasonal.  They have odd hours though.
Jenny L.}Washington Township, NJ}9}85}211}-1}5}12/7/2014}This bus my new favorite place for dessert!  Love the mochi ice cream with red bean and the bean soup is perfectly lightly sweetened.  The black bean ice cream is also great as it has a bold sesame flavor one would expect when eating this dessert.  The atmosphere is cosy but nevertheless small. The staff is also very friend.  My advise is if u have a large party, try to see if can reserve a seat
James T.}Brooklyn, NY}728}152}3}-1}5}12/6/2014}Walk into Cha-an and allow your senses to give way to a better state of being. The peaceful atmosphere will calm your nerves, the scent of freshly baked scones will waft over you and tease your palate, and one of their many exotic teas will complete the journey and warm your soul. If you don't appreciate the drama, here's something more droll: Cash-money only playas.
Khadija T.}Winter Park, FL}0}5}0}-1}5}12/1/2014}Love this place! The black sesame creme brulee is to die for, I loved the salmon toast as well, and the staff is friendly.
Sandra S.}Brooklyn, NY}178}495}269}18}5}11/30/2014}Itadakimasu! Gochisousama deshita!Whenever my sister & I have a bit of a Japan withdrawal (wanting to visit there again but can't at the moment) & a sweet tooth, we come to Cha-An. It is definitely one of our favorite dessert places to go to. Desserts here are very light but full of flavor. We always leave content and very satisfied (w/o feeling full or disgusted with ourselves).Cha-An is more well known for their desserts (they also serve foods but imo they are not worth it). I have only eaten desserts here, so my review will be based on all the desserts and tea I have consumed. My first time at Cha-An was 2 years ago. I ordered the chef's 3 course dessert set (seasonal), but I do not remember anything memorable about it. The only thing I remembered was the sakura flan and black sesame creme brulee we ordered in addition to the dessert set, which left us with an urge to come back to Cha-An again. And till this day, we always order the flan and creme brulee.Their flans are seasonal (tried sakura, and currently the flavor is chestnut). It is the most tastiest and softiest flan I have ever eaten. Everytime I eat it, I feel like I am dancing on cloud nine. I would rank their flan as #1 to try out of all the desserts.The black sesame creme brulee is also something worth trying, and imo is Cha-An's 2nd best dessert (if I had to rank it).Their Green Tea Ice Cream Parfait is also very delicious, light, and full of flavor. The texture (soft & crunchy) is enjoyable for my palate.Mochi (Black Sesame, Green Tea, and Chocolate) was also wonderful, but not my most favorite. The mochi is very soft, and the inside of the mochi was decadent like chocolate truffles.Regarding tea, I do not think that they were that impressive. The teas were a bit weak & not strong flavored, and definitely not the best I have consumed. The teas I have tried include: flower craft tea, genmaicha (green tea w/ roasted rice), and matcha green tea. Aesthetically, the flower craft tea looks beautiful but it lacked flavor. The genmaicha was also not that flavorful. My Ito-En genmaicha tea packet tastes better than this. The matcha green tea was delicious, and would be the only one I would order again.Portions are small and it is a bit pricey, but the quality really speaks for itself. And, the desserts here are really authentic. Decor is very zen-like and relaxing. Staff are very friendly and courteous. Service is a bit slow, but they never rush you to leave (which is rare in fast paced NYC).  *It gets busy here, but they always inform you how many minutes the wait is and is reliable in calling you back to tell you that the table is ready for you.**Really try that flan & creme brulee! You will not regret!Cash only.
Katrina N.}Irvine, CA}92}395}1990}18}4}11/28/2014}My only reason for coming to this place: Green Tea desserts!!Before going to NY, my green tea crazed mind had already starting drooling when I looked at the Cha-an dessert pictures.  Actually, it wasn't just the GT, but I knew all the other asian desserts, black sesame, would be satisfying, but wouldn't make me sick from all the sweets.  The one reason why I seek out asian dessert places is because of this main reason, that and the fact that they don't use heavy ingredients that make me feel guilty after eating it.  I got the sampler that included -black sesame ice cream 4.0 stars Although it was a little icy, I got strong flavors of black sesame -black sesame cookie and gt cookie 4 stars  Very buttery and again good strong flavors on both.  The cookie crumpled in your mouth and sweet, but not too much -black sesame creme brulee 4.5 starsThis was my favorite over all of the rest.  Delicious creamy creme brulee, but black sesame flavor!  What can be better?-mango mochi w red bean 3.5 stars  The mango mochi was excellent as well as the red bean, 0.5 stars was deducted for the red bean was too sweet -GT pudding. 3.5 starsAgain, strong GT flavor, but... very bland.  I like the texture though.The original sampler didn't have all black sesame and GT. In fact, instead of getting the GT pudding, I was supposed to get something with hot fudge, but I asked for a replacement.  When the desserts arrived, we ate in a methodical way, anything that can't be at room temperature was attacked first.  Although, our plan of attack looked good on paper, we had forgotten that the mango mochi was cold and the red bean hot!  And so the icecream turned into a slight liquid when bitten into.  On the bright side, the mochi was excellent!  Buy Bueno Stamp!!
Caroline C.}Brooklyn, NY}384}310}284}-1}5}11/23/2014}I can't believe it took me years to finally come here! Love everything about Cha-An, from the tea to the unique desserts to the ambience to the full tea room experience.  And yes, you have to get the black sesame creme brulee.  Don't even think twice!
Gavin C.}Brooklyn, NY}89}62}147}-1}1}11/22/2014}Extremely our service for a Japanese restaurant! Girlfriend ordered a pot of hot tea and found there was a string of hair inside the pot~ we brought it up to the waitress and she have us an attitude like "So?" Then walked away without doing anything. I have been to well established Japanese restaurant all around the states and globe, and this is by far the most unacceptable manner for a Japanese restaurant. If you, the owner, sees this message. I sincerely hope that you can retrain your waiting staff. Thank you.
Bo Y.}Chicago, IL}43}170}677}-1}5}11/22/2014}Everything here is so lovely.We tried their salmon toast, not as good as we expected.But the Green Tea Parfait is fantastic!We came around 9pm and was told that we had to wait for about 1 hour. Its one of the most popular places in this area.
Amy T.}Flushing, Queens, NY}131}148}396}-1}3}11/22/2014}This place was so cute, when I got there it was pretty empty, however it got packed really quickly. Honestly, this place is overrated and for what your get, it is extremely pricey! Don't get me wrong, if the food is good, I would not even complained about the price. I had this restaurant bookmarked for so long and when I finally went yesterday, it was disappointing.  This review will be for the dinner experience, I think with lunch, they might have a different menu. So, here we go...Location: It was very hidden, they do have signs outside but it was hard to find. You can take the N or R train to 8st NYU. Don't drive.... parking will be a pain! Service: Really nice, I noticed that one of the waitress kept refilling my friend's teapot which was very nice. When I came in, they sat me immediately while I was waiting for my friend (not that many restaurant allows that).  Food: Very limited sets, actually only two! lol Set B was $24 which was what my friend ordered... it comes with today's soup (miso) and today's dessert (green tea ice cream sandwich or green tea creme brûlée). I didn't want to get the sets because both don't look that amazing and it seem so limited! So, what I did was get the appetizer sampler which was 6 mini dishes and I got a bowl of the 15 gain rice with pickle. How was it? It was okay, the only dish I like was tea roasted salmon... everything else i can get at a Japanese market.  The rice and salmon was yummy! My friend was still hungry after the set... so that kinda tells you a lot. Dessert: Black sesame creme brûlée which was very yummy with great sesame favor, however I think they over did it with the sesame ice cream... Basically, it was a creme brûlée, ice cream on top, and a cracker on top... Just stop please, I just want to enjoy the creme brûlée, you can put the ice cream on the side. The green tea sandwich that comes with the set was okay too. I think my local bakery taste better... Conclusion: Will I come back? No, just once in a life time experience. Will I recommend my friends to come here? Probably just for desserts but not really, I really think their dessert was average !
Ellie H.}Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA}10}61}162}-1}5}11/14/2014}If you are a big fan of matcha and homemade style Japanese food, it is the right place for you! It is a lovely cozy restaurant. I highly recommend the Kato set, which includes basically everything.
Linda H.}San Antonio, TX}137}219}953}18}4}11/12/2014}My friends and I had plans to eat dinner at Momofukus, but little did we know about the wait.  So, here we are..totally not from NYC and wasn't quite sure on where to go.  So, of course...Yelp helped us out.We decided to go to Cha-An because of the great ratings and we're not really sure what we were getting ourselves into.  I knew it was a Japanese restaurant, but I wasn't aware that there were set courses.I was a little hesitant at the beginning with the set menu, but decided to go with the Cha-An Set B.  I was super grateful when the waitress even asked if any of us had any food allergies.  I'm allergic to shellfish and I was very pleased to hear someone asking.When my little tray came out..my first thought was...."THAT'S IT?", but as I started eating my food, I was pleasantly surprised how delicious and filling the meal was.  I LOVED, LOVED the soup that they had that day.I know that this place is famous for their desserts, but we were completely full and couldn't really eat any.  However, next time I'm back in town...I'm heading here for desserts!The staff was really pleasant and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.Oh, they only accept CASH, so make sure to stop by the ATM before you go there.
Rui S.}Brooklyn, NY}5}18}0}-1}5}11/12/2014}adorable little place, great afternoon tea time with girls! Jasmine tea icecream is phenomenal!Sometimes this place could be packed and needs a little wait, but it is definitely worth the waiting. The sampler plate is great for first-timer!**This place is cash only though
Mimi V.}Elk Grove, CA}307}617}811}18}5}11/5/2014}This is such a cutesy place! I wish they had more of these places in Sacramento, Ca, but unfortunately they don't. Anyways, walking into this place, it leads you straight up the stairs into a cute cafe. My bf and I came here to just relax and hang out, so we ordered some tea and the sesame creme brulee. The tea was very soothing and came in a cool tea pot (i forgot what tea i ordered, i just asked them to choose it for me). The sesame creme brulee is a must! It was a sesame pudding on the bottom topped with the toasted sugar on top. To spice things up, they even put a scoop of sesame ice creme with a sesame cracker. It was mouthgasmic! I wanted to try their food, however i was already really full and didn't think i can stuff myself with anymore food. The ambiance of this place makes you really feel like your in Japan. The service was very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place!
Aria H.}Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY}52}21}0}-1}3}10/31/2014}Toasts and green-tea dessert tastes great. But the server kept my friend and I seating outside since we are waiting for one more friend to come. And we are told at the very end that it's cash only. I can't imagine such an expensive restaurant don't accept credit cards.
Dawn L.}Brooklyn, NY}263}136}6}-1}4}10/30/2014}I've been here twice.  The customer service was decent.  The wait staff were attentive but did not take the time to introduce the specials or explain how the menu worked.  The menu is kind of out of the ordinary- only had a lunch menu and two options (2 prix fixe options and a limited a la carte menu).  The dessert menu and drink menu had more options.  The food is definitely good and well presented however, it is a little overpriced for the portion and taste.  The desserts however were amazing.  Will definitely come again.
Sarah K.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}425}265}25}-1}5}10/28/2014}This place is adorable! The decor inside is beautiful - with a tea-house looking set up. The service is polite, although it was a bit absent with how busy it was on a Saturday afternoon. My friend and I ordered a pot of green tea, the black sesame creme brulee (which I could not finish on my own, to my regret), and the green tea jelly dessert. I wish we didn't eat before, so that we could have tried the food (specifically the lox toast!). It is a little pricy, but it is just such a cute place to have tea and dessert.Also, the bathroom has one of those bidet toilets.
J L.}New York, NY}23}142}4}-1}5}10/27/2014}I know this is a tea place but I like their desserts better. The wait can get long and it is cash only. Cozy spot.
Lucie R.}Manhattan, NY}22}24}0}-1}4}10/26/2014}My favorite desserts spot and amazing tea.The mochis are amazing.Lunch items were ok, I rather prefer coming here for the sweets and tea.It's cash only.
Yvette Y.}Atlanta, GA}34}57}2}-1}4}10/25/2014}It's a good place for dessert. I had the chef's sampler, all of  them are good. Price is reasonable. I like this place.
Charles G.}Los Angeles, CA}11}43}2}-1}3}10/20/2014}Really wonderful place. I ordered the B Kago set (which included soup, a meat dish, sashimi salad, grain rice, lotus root, and desert) and also pu-erh tea. Everything served was top notch. It is truly wonderful and represents the best of what the Japanese do so well: subtle flavors, healthy and fresh ingredients. I really liked this place and cannot wait to return. 4 stars.My only real gripe (and why I deducted a star) is that it is a cash-only establishment. It's common knowledge that this is simply the restaurant owners cheaping out of the credit card companies' surcharges. (They are also likely evading taxes.) It is inexcusable and people should start making more noise about it. The customer experience is diminished when they have to worry about having enough cash. I hope Cha-An reevaluates their position and begins accepting plastic.
Yi-Jin Y.}Brooklyn, NY}130}11}34}-1}4}10/19/2014}Only came here for dessert - they had amazing homemade mochi (my favorite was the earl grey chocolate), which comes in a sampler set of 3; also tried the iced matcha latte and hojicha anmitsu (green tea jelly, rice glutinous balls, sweet syrup, grass jelly, green tea ice cream) which started off not that sweet until I realized the sweet syrup was all at the bottom, so try to keep that in mind as you start digging into the ice cream and jelly at the top. Both were great options on their dessert menu and I'd love to go back - the atmosphere is great (perfect for a date); only caveats are that the place is small, on the second floor, and is cash only!
Benjamin H.}Manhattan, NY}3}33}0}-1}5}10/18/2014}Not the best service in the world, that's okay.  Yummy food, creative.  amazing tea.  will be back very soon.
Kevin O.}New York, NY}0}2}1}-1}5}10/17/2014}Dessert was amazing! I got the chef sample and got to try 5 of their desserts. All we're amazing but my favorite has to be the black sesame creme brûlée, with the red bean kochi being a close second.The only downside is that the tea was not strong enough, but that could just be me.
T S.}CA, CA}10}177}2}-1}5}10/13/2014}Instant love . I can't help it..just instant love. Like when u meet that blind date in a restaurant and all the sudden you're like 'where have u been all my life?'Such Japanese perfection. So charming, exquisite, refined (except for the too loud and obnoxious white Americans :) the tea was spectacular, the decor gorgeous and the waitperson kind.  I can't wait to clme back this week and try the smoked salmon and the matcha next!
Ellie H.}Jersey City, NJ}1}62}15}-1}4}10/9/2014}The deserts were great! And we also tried two different kinds of tea there which was also very good. And we liked the environment of the restaurant.
David K.}San Jose, CA}103}166}341}18}4}10/5/2014}Came just for the desserts. I'll upload pictures of what we had. Do more that this place is CASH ONLY. Which is a bummer.
Mel S.}Mountain View, CA}201}316}161}-1}4}10/5/2014}cozy, intimate korean tea house with irresistible sweet treats!
Ruoqi Z.}New York, NY}113}93}95}-1}4}10/2/2014}I always found myself eating at Cha -An when I need to watch my diet and still enjoy a great meal. My friend ordered the set A and I ordered set B and I especially love the five grain rice. Although everything is in small portion, I am pretty full without feeling stuffed. Remember to bring cash because this is cash only. Also, remember to make a reservation if u wanna come during peak hours. Everything on the dessert menu is great but the black sesame creme brûlée is my favorite.
Jenny L.}Brooklyn, NY}214}93}47}-1}3}9/27/2014}We came here with a party of 6 and the wait wasn't so bad. We were seated at the bar though, so maybe that's why.I ordered the green tea parfait and toast to share with my sister. We both agreed that the parfait was good, comes with mochi balls, ice cream, whipped cream, and um, rice crispy on the bottom. The toast was just mediocre. Kind of tasted like the breakfast toast I had this morning fresh from my toasting. Nothing special, but for the prices here it's a big no-no. No I would not order it again, and no you shouldn't charge me so much for a thick slice of carb.I took off another star because the wait time for our food was so ridiculously long. C'mon dude, how long does it take to put two scoops of ice cream together and toast some bread? The other items we ordered were flan (pre-maid, just scoop it out!), tea (boil water?), and another parfait. I really can't imagine why it would like a life time and a half to assemble these items.The only reason why this place got three stars instead of two was because the ambience was great. Even though the food didn't taste amazing, you can taste the quality and I think that's what you are paying for. Other wise, how can they charge such prices for a little hole on the second flood?Bottom line: Come with a sweet tooth, low expectations, and a lot of time.
Seven T.}San Diego, CA}77}724}338}-1}5}9/26/2014Updatedreview}1 star? 2 stars? Yall trippin!!Cha-An has almost gotten Sevens Seven Star Stamp of Approval!Seriously, bring ya lady, 30-40$, and ya sweet tooth and thoroughly enjoy the excellence that is, the Chefs Dessert Sampler and pick out some fine tea to enjoy!Clean spot, good service, and the list goes on! This is for sure a must-hit spot! Cha-An....doin it PROPER!
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}4}9/25/2014}There are very few just "tea" places in manhattan. However, Asians take it mad seriously. Tea is equivalent to coffee in Asia....gets very expensive and there's a whole culture around it. I have to say that this place is on the pricier side...with teas averaging 7-8 dollars per kettle. However, people share the tea and talk for hours in Asia and refill the kettle with hot water so really every cup of yea averages out the price. Ok ok I ll shut up and get to the point. I hadn't eaten here until pretty recently. The food is very light and fresh. Not hearty and heavy, but satisfying in it's own way. There are subtle flavors that even I appreciate...and I usually dismiss what others call "subtle" as bland and tasteless.Anyway. The dessert that came with the summer set wasn't enough for me and I got another one instead. And boy am I glad I did! The black sesame creme brûlée was sooooo good. Omg next time I come back I'm getting that again for sure. Ok so I sort of wrote a novel but if you read this far I just wanted to brag that this was my first review as a yelp elitist. LEET YAYUH. Only foodies will understand what I feel to be a pretty big accomplishment. I pat my own back. That's how we do!
Eve T.}Brooklyn, NY}15}20}1}-1}2}9/23/2014}CASH ONLY AND NO MORE SCONES. We went there to try the Earl Grey scones we've heard so much about, but they've been taken off the menu. :-( Also, the place only takes cash, so we went elsewhere; if they'd still had the scones we would've run to an ATM, but they didn't.
Tracy C.}Long Island City, NY}35}63}8}-1}4}9/23/2014}The desserts are very yummy and pretty! There is a good selection of different kinds of tea! I love having tea and eating dessert like a Japanese tea party! I like the flower blooming and green teas but want to try the other ones too! I also tried the cold matcha red bean drink which was really good! The interior is like a mini Japanese tea place with a well and bamboo everywhere! I recommend this place for dating and hanging out with friends!
Evangeline W.}Manhattan, NY}1}34}0}-1}5}9/22/2014}Until coming here, I had never tried Japanese desserts. Now I'm kind of obsessed. Damn you cha an.
Yuki B.}New York, NY}142}155}15}-1}4}9/22/2014}Hello dear people of Cha An,Thank you for bringing me a time of peace in this chaotic yet glorious city. I wish i could give this location a 5 but i gotta try your food to decide!I went to cha an yesterday after a time of sad experiences. None of the meals i had were good!! So i needed tea to chill my stomach.My girlfriend and i went in and ordered two teas: green tea Dragon Well and Chrysanthemum. Well... I loved it! The chrysan tea had such a delicate taste and the green tea was not really strong, even though i wish i could have tasted it more... But yea, it was pretty good!The atmosphere was great, except for the loud couple next to us who spoke so damn loud!!! People need to learn to speak to  each other not to the whole room.My girlfriend enjoyed it as well. But like she said, we gotta come and eat!
Addison Y.}Los Angeles, CA}347}227}224}18}4}9/22/2014}Came here with couple of friends hoping this will be a great lunch spot.  The food and tea was really good, but I'm a 5'11" over 240 lb man.  The lunch special portion was small, but very delicious.  Due to the small portion, we ordered dessert too.  It was very good. I would definitely recommend coming here after a meal.  Great place for dessert and very refreshing tea.
Jing X.}Brooklyn, NY}237}636}2725}-1}4}9/21/2014}Located on the 2nd floor of a relatively quiet street near Saint Marks, this charming little tea house has the best black sesame creme brûlée!  Service was great and the calm/relaxing atmosphere was perfect for catching up with an old friend. We shared their prefix Set B and also ordered the creme brûlée. Came with a small tofu seaweed salad, soup, 7 grain rice, tea smoked salmon (3 pieces on some greens), 2 side dishes (calamari and tofu skin in mushroom soup), and dessert (brownie bite with raspberry ice cream).  Portion sizes are small, think tapas, but satisfying for two somewhat hungry girls.  Food was very flavorful and yet felt light and healthy.  Definitely coming back!P.S.  they have those awesome Japanese toilets that spray water and wash your bottom.  The control panel, including Flush, is on the right, next to the toilet paper.  I was nervous at first but it's actually quite relaxing!Update: 2nd time here, the service was not that great.  Pretty slow and inattentive.  Docking a star from my original 5-star review.  Their Tuesday lunch special (chili shrimp) was delicious though and only $13 for the set!
Holly C.}New York, NY}502}280}85}-1}4}9/20/2014}Get the sesame creme brulee!! Delicious! You can probably pass on the flan if you like typical Hispanic flan like I do. Their texture was interesting, more loose like a panna cotta. I want to try the mochi and ice cream next time! Their selection of tea is awesome! Also, their food is good. The presentation is very quaint and cute, very typical of traditional Japanese style. I'd come back often if I lived in NYC. The place is smaller though, and sometimes you may have a long wait, but it's worth it!
Judy S.}San Diego, CA}285}1001}1013}18}5}9/17/2014}This place is a hidden gem! One street above St Marks, Cha-An is tucked away upstairs. There's minimal table and bar seating, so beware of the wait time.I came here at the recommendation of a friend to try the Tea-Smoked Salmon on Toast. And boy was it worth it! I have no words. Seriously. Go try it. It's savory, moist, thick. And don't worry, it is substantial. I was worried that the toast would be too heavy but the toast was just as delicious as the salmon! I usually hate raw veggies and never order salads, but my dining companion with whom I was sharing insisted on the tofu and seaweed salad. Surprisingly, it was absolutely delicious without sacrificing texture. Most delicious salads are drenched in oil and sauce to cover up the taste of raw veggies. But this was very clean, minimal oil with delicious dressing that I couldn't put my finger on. And the cherry on top? If you go to the ladies room, there's a bidet!
Jessica O.}Manhattan, NY}11}39}49}-1}4}9/17/2014}Cha an has better food menu than its dessert menu even though it's what they're known for. I've tried their desserts. They're good but not great. Lunch menu here is actually really a good deal and it comes with 7 grain rice and tea. I've been coming back to this place more often to grab lunch with my friend. Also the waitress was always really nice!
Katie R.}Manhattan, NY}8}23}11}-1}5}9/16/2014}My favorite dessert/cafe place in NYC.I am giving this place 5 stars instead of 4, since they have gotten faster with the seating and wait time. The interior is BEAUTIFUL. Traditional Japanese, and not super noisy. THEY ALSO HAVE A DAMN TEA ROOM IN THE PLACE!!!I order matcha all the time--it comes with mochi and anko on the side ^_^ It's just like what is served in traditional chado ceremonies (sweetness balances out the bitterness of the tea).All of the desserts are good, you can literally order anything on the menu and be satisfied. The sakura flan (which was off the menu for the longest time ever, due to its popularity) has a nice, soft flavor to it, and will go with any of the teas. The black sesame creme brulee, matcha parfait, and zenzai are the desserts I usually order, and have never disappointed me. Their mini smoked salmon sandwich served during lunch is also very tasty. Great place to go to after dinner with your friends. Their cookies and green tea truffles are TO DIE FOR. Just don't forget to bring cash, they do not take credit cards.
Jessica X.}Stanford, CA}210}162}39}-1}5}9/10/2014}Came here especially for the dessert and since I couldn't decide what to get, I got the dessert sampler. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!It came with 5 different desserts, a mini sizes, but totally enough to satisfy you and a friend. My favorite was the sesame creme brulee and the mochi red bean dessert. The desserts came out really fast and were devoured pretty fast too haha. Our server was also very kind and made sure we had everything we needed. The place is also super cute and you feel like you're in an actual Japanese tea room! :) I will definitely be coming back with friends.
Katrina L.}Manhattan, NY}175}378}98}-1}4}9/9/2014}This is a lovely place for healthy Japanese food, tea, and dessert.The dinner set looks deceivingly small in portion, but is actually very filling.Set B:- Tea smoked salmon - Comes with three slices of smoked salmon on top a bed a salad with light dressing. Delicious, but did not taste the tea in the description.- Mackerel side - They were nice enough to let me switch out the shrimp side that came with Set A for this one (due to friend's allergies and my personal dislike of mayo). Very glad they let me switch because it was delicious.- Miso soup - In addition to the typical tofu and scallions, comes with button mushrooms and some sort of green bean.- Tofu side - Three pieces of lightly fried firm tofu soaked in sauce. It was good, but I would have preferred soft/silken tofu since the texture was like that of a sponge.- Dessert - a friend and I both ordered Set B but we had to share dessert, which came in an uneven amount. We got 3 pieces of green tea mochi on top of a pool of honey. The presentation was nice, the mochi was good, but did not need the honey especially since they didn't pair well together. The other dessert was an almond cookie sandwich served in a wine glass. It was awkward to eat, as it was hard to pick the cookies out of the glass. It wasn't anything special - just two almond cookies, cream and little chunks strawberry with powdered sugar.The desserts in the Set were unimpressive. The food was good, but for dessert I would stick with other options in the menu, such as the sesame creme brulee (which is amazing).
Dennis C.}Los Angeles, CA}195}245}275}-1}4}9/6/2014}I really liked the decor of this place, really looks like a Japanese tea house. The bathroom was clean and the ladies room apparently has a bidet toilet seat?!I got the lunch special ($13) which was a sizeable bowl of chicken soboro, a seaweed-sesame salad, and some Japanese pickles. Also included was a pot of Genmeicha tea. I'm not much of a tea connoisseur, but I could tell that it was pretty good stuff. Free refills of course. The chicken soboro was pretty solid as was the seaweed-sesame salad. The rice was great, it was filled with a mixture of nutritious grains. The pickles were pretty salty, but I guess it's ok when you eat it with the rice.Tried my friend's salmon toast which was delicious, would definitely recommend that also. Also the lunch special changes by day. Was a little disappointed I ended up with the chicken, since they do have dishes such as salmon tartar and unagi on the weekdays. Still, big and tasty portions for a reasonable price, and great tea!
Jay K.}Manhattan, NY}3}6}0}-1}2}9/2/2014}There is so much hype about the desserts at this place. I went during lunchtime on Friday, so there was definitely no crowd, but if I ever want to go in the evening, there is always a huge line and nobody from the restaurant directs you about waiting in the line or anything. The lunch special (don buri) for $13 was okay; too much rice. The mochi was delicious, but I can also get that at other places. Service was okay; the staff are not particularly helpful or friendly. Seems like they're trying to turn tables as quickly as possible.Conclusion: Overrated. I don't need to visit this place ever again. Oh, and cash only.
Hiro W.}New York, NY}0}21}23}-1}4}8/31/2014}Such a cute Japanese tea house. They use "tatami" for the sitting couch and have a traditional Japanese roofing decor. My husband got Salmon toast which was delicious mixture of raw salmon with salad and mustard like dressing. He got Jasmine tea as well, great aroma. I got dessert sampler three course (it says three courses but it comes all at once in a tray) I got pu-erh tea leaf for my tea, perfect for refreshing between sweets. The bathroom had awesome Japanese  wash-let technology. Servers are nice and will explain everything if you have any questions.
Fiona L.}New Brunswick, NJ}425}349}1590}-1}4}8/31/2014}The moment I climbed up the stairs into this teahouse I was awed by the Japanese tea house decors!! The atmosphere was very soothing and relaxing. It had the Japanese teahouse look/style with a modern twist. The teahouse isn't very big, but there was enough room between each table to give he customers privacy and space. Also, I saw that there were tea rooms to the side of the house, which looked very cool! So far, I've tried the smoked and grilled salmon toast! I adore the smoked salmon toast! The salmon was very fresh and thinly sliced onto the crispy golden toast, and romaine lettuce (or something similar) were layered on top of the salmon along with a drizzle of creamy and appetizing dressing. I also had the matcha tea with red bean. Green tea is considered in the cooler side and red bean on the warmer side, so the mix of the two created a nice twist and flavor! More importantly, the matcha tea had lots of flavor.My second time coming here I had the chrysanthemum blossom tea ($6) and the hojicha anmitsu ($8.50). I was expecting the tea to be sweeter since it has chrysanthemum, but the tea was rather light with a hint of spiciness. It ended up being a good complement with the dessert because the dessert was a little too sweet for me! The green tea ice cream would've gone well with the balance of the lightly flavored jelly and glutinous rice balls, but the addition of the black syrup made the dessert a little too sweet.Overall, it has a good variety of desserts and teas and a selective few of main food/tea sets, which allow them to focus and specialize into making those good! The environment and service were very impressive!
Maheen M.}Monroe Township, NJ}347}204}824}-1}5}8/30/2014}This is my third time here and I absolutely love it! The tea is delicious, the toasts are scrumptious, and the desert is to die for! The atmosphere is oriental and cultural and at the same time modern and social. However it is a bit on the pricey side.
Cristina C.}Santa Ana, CA}75}16}97}-1}4}8/28/2014}love their Black Sesame Cream Brulee~ yummy~
Jen B.}Las Vegas, NV}243}147}158}-1}2}8/26/2014}The restaurant itself was very lovely.  You walk into the venue, and up a flight of wooden stairs. It immediately feels like you're in asia the way the decor is in the restaurant. I came here specifically for 2 things: The Tea Salmon Toast and the Dessert Sampler., As we got seated, it took a while for the server to come to our table to take our order. Mind you the restaurant was not packed at all. Once the server finally came to our table, I put in for the dessert and toast.  The server asked if it was ok that both the tea salmon toast and the dessert sampler arrive at the same time. Personally, I wanted it to, so it worked out.We got the Tea Salmon Toast, and boy did it look very pretty! I took one bite and it was sadly to say, "just ok".  There wasn't very much salmon on the toast at all.. it was very deceiving.Now, once we finished the toast, we waited, and waited, and waited for our dessert.  I thought it was suppose to come out at the same time?The server finally approached our table 30 min later and asked if we were still waiting on anything else. We told the server that we were waiting for our dessert and they apologized and admitted that they forgot about it. The dessert came out 2 min later, and by the look of it... i thought "Wow! This was worth the wait."  When i dug into everything on the dessert sampler, there was nothing on the platter that was phenomenal, but rather "Just ok".Its sad because I was really looking forward to this place... but overall from food to service, it was very disappointing.
Bilal D.}New York, NY}18}13}1}-1}5}8/24/2014}Rich taste, excellent service, outstanding presentation!! A little nice hidden jam. Can't wait to get back
Rani T.}Los Angeles, CA}2}11}0}-1}1}8/18/2014}The menu is limited. Will not recommend if you have a big appetite. I'm Japanese so I expect exceptional service everytime I eat Japanese food. I had no expectations since I'm not from NYC but I've ate at a variety authentic restaurants around the world. There were many problems eating here. First, the waiter kept informing us while we were ordering we had to spend a minimum of $6.00 even though everyone ordered food. Second, we asked TWICE for water. We could've asked more than twice but we were trying to be patient. Waitress never came so we walked to the water pitcher and poured our OWN water. Third, since we didn't know it was cash only, half of us had to walk to the bank to get cash. While the other half was waiting for them to return, the waitress came up to us and told us to hurry and finish since they were closing. I don't mind waiters telling us when they are closed and say it in a polite way but the lady was very rude and they were still open for another 15 minutes. We even told them we were waiting for others to come back for cash so we can pay for the bill. I was surprised by my experience I tipped under the 15%. As we left we they literally yelled at us and say we didn't pay them the tip that is required by law. Our argument is tip is earned, not expected. I'm very generous with tip but they simply didn't earn it. Fair enough. She was sooo angry and didn't even apologize for their horrible service. The ambiance is quiet and dark. It has the potential to make you feel you are at a tea house in Japan. As we sat, we were greeted by the waitresses. The first page of the menu had instructions, such as minimum charge $6.00 person.  This place is CASH ONLY! Cheapest beer is $6.00 so it's easy to reach the minimum. I didn't have the food but looking to my right it looked amazing, but definitely overpriced. I ordered the brick toast with red bean and sesame ice cream. Nothing special about it except the sesame ice cream. Not worth $13, I've spent much less on better desserts.
Cynthia D.}Queens, NY}454}803}5869}18}4}8/18/2014}Oh my, the Tea-smoked Salmon Toast was really good!  I really loved the decor of this spot. Everything here was neatly placed and organized. My friend and I came here for afternoon tea/snack. Tea-smoked Salmon Toast was really tasty! The toast was still warm and it smelled really good! There was a field of greens on top with a few pieces of fresh salmon. The dressing that came with tasted like strong mustard, a bit too strong. It was a satisfying snack that I ordered along with my matcha tea.Chef's Dessert Platter - it was a very cute assembly of Asian-fusion desserts. We had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, Black Sesame Ice-cream, Matcha cookies, Citron Cake, and Mango Ice-cream Mochi in Red Bean Soup. All are very interesting little desserts and really sweet. Definitely, come and give Japanese tea-time/desserts a try.
Bob B.}Manhattan, NY}0}128}0}-1}4}8/9/2014}A very "kawaii" place.  The closest thing that NYC has to Tokyo's Q-Pot Cafe (not same league, but you get the idea).  Walk upstairs to a sweets and tea focused Japanese styled cafe.  However, you can get a proper meal here - the savory dishes are thoughtfully prepared and have variety and taste.  And of course lots of delicious desserts.
Sonya C.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}1}8/5/2014}Went there with my friend on a Saturday afternoon. When we walked in, waitress are all moving very fast and you can't even make eye contacts with any of them. No one even paid a slight attention to us. No host No greeting. We stood there for 5 more minutes and still had no one to greet us. Then my friend took out a pen and write down our name on the waiting list! We waited for another 20 minutes and then finally caught a waitress's attention. She shown us our seat and menu then no where to find. We waited another 10 minutes and finally someone came to our table to take order. WHAT IS STILL MISSING HERE???....WATER!!! We didn't get our water until our food comes. I know this is a tea house but severing a cup of water is the BASIC etiquette!!!  So is to greet your customer!!! What happened to this Japanese restaurant? It is supposed to have good customer service. Then the food....it is waaaaay below an average Japanese restaurant's standard. I know most of the pictures from this restaurant look pretty nice. Don't be fooled by that. Tasteless food. Super duper sweet dessert. Not to mention "only cash" ??!! Definitely not going back and definitely won't recommend this place!
Rainbow L.}Los Angeles, CA}35}33}15}-1}4}8/4/2014}Everything is so cute and presentable (which isn't a surprise since it's a Japanese place. Supah kawaiiii~~~) but since everyone already mentioned all the food so aside from that, everyone who is anyone, must visit the bathroom bc they have a badet!!! Just have to put that out there if anyone wants to give it a spin haha
Bowie S.}Miami, FL}693}208}434}-1}4}8/3/2014}Came here to meet up with an old high school friend to catch up on life over tea and desserts. There's a nice ambiance here, it's dark and sophisticated. We ordered the sampler with 6 little dishes, and the dessert sampler with 5 or so different things on it. The Black Sesame Crème Brûlée is something that I remembered, it's been a few months since I've visited this place. Very nice, and chill spot to visit. Btw it's a cash only place.
Christopher A.}New York, NY}537}139}117}18}3}8/2/2014}You walk in and instantly get the "Japanese feel." It's certainly cozy and everyone is kind of on top of each other. First thing I noticed was the time it took for us to get seated, to when we ordered, 10-15 minutes. Service is sub par and took us awhile to get anything. The food was interesting. I won't say if was bad but not that good either. I got the Chicken Soboro rice dish. It was very colorful. Brown riceSmall pieces of chickenGarlicLettuceMintEdamameIt tasted just as colorful. Rice was a good texture, chicken was not noticeable, garlic was pungent, mint was light but overbearing at times, the edamame contrasts well with everything else being soft. I personally did not like it. It was a very good price though, $13. My favorite was the tea, which this place is known for. The tea was very good. It was not hot at all but warm enough to drink and enjoy. I didn't have the dessert sampler but I heard it was just okay. I rate this place a 3, because well it's a bit obvious. Food is preferential, service was below average, tea was good, and overall it certainly didn't wow me. Probably wouldn't come here again.
Lingling D.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}2}13}26}-1}5}8/2/2014}came here for dessert after lunch. The environment is so good and the food is so awesome! The waiter was nice!!
Sara W.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}101}187}14}-1}4}7/30/2014}I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my mom and luckily came in at the perfect time because there were a few open spots. This place filled up quickly after!  My mom ordered the tea jelly dessert, Hojicha Anmitsu, which sounded odd to me but it was quite tasty, authentic and light!  Really liked it with all of the various textures of jelly, mochi, red beans and ice cream--kind of a hodgepodge!  I had the tea smoked salmon toast that came on bread that was about 3 inches thick!  Really tasty but maybe a tad too much mustard dressing.  We ordered two iced teas and I really enjoyed my hibiscus tea.  Next time I'd like to come here with a few more people to get the dessert sampler because it looked AMAZING! The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because it is over priced.  $7.50 for an iced tea?  Yowzers--didn't think it was worth it!  If you plan on coming here (1 drink + light food dish), don't think you're getting out for under $20 a person!
Kristina W.}San Francisco, CA}201}111}166}-1}4}7/28/2014}I love small Asian cafes with beautifully-presented, innovative desserts, and wish there were more of them in Chicago. Everything I tried here was delicious, but a tad bit pricey considering the portion sizes. However, I would recommend trying this dessert place at least once!Matcha Latte - hot ($7.50) - I asked the waitress for tea suggestions, and she recommended this one. It was the perfect level of sweetness, and had red beans at the bottom, which you could eat with a spoon while drinking the tea. They also offer the iced version of this drink during the summer, but I'm not sure if that one also comes with red beans. Tea-Smoked Salmon Toast ($13) - The salmon was fresh, the toast soft and fluffy, and the mustard(?) sauce paired nicely with the dish. My only complaint is that I wish they could've given more salmon. since that disappeared quickly and then we were just eating the toast by itself.Black Sesame Crème Brûlée ($9) - OH MY GOD this was delicious. No complaints. There's a reason every review on Yelp mentions it and says its the best! ORDER IT.Overall, if I had to recommend one item, it would be the Black Sesame Crème Brûlée, but beware - it's a super small portion and will be devoured in less than 10 bites. If you're with someone else, get 2 different desserts and share them.
Michael C.}Brooklyn, NY}4}67}0}-1}5}7/27/2014}Cha-An is like a really attractive friend you have that's far more successful and happy than you'll ever be and you can only see them on the rarest of occasions. Everything Cha-An does is great and it just makes you hate yourself. Your parents probably wish you were more like Cha-An.
Nancy Y.}New York, NY}0}2}9}-1}3}7/22/2014}nice décor and environment.... good concept too. but the food wasn't super
Daisy L.}Manhattan, NY}0}30}0}-1}5}7/22/2014}Cha An's 15 Grain Rice Porridge is the real deal!  It brings back memories of childhood and tastes like the rice porridge I grew up eating.  The service is great and very knowledgable. It's a great place for a light meal or dessert!
Vanessa M.}Los Angeles, CA}1228}775}2733}18}3}7/19/2014}3 1/2 stars.Came here for just dessert after our dinner. I love Asian desserts because I find them to be lighter and not as sweet. After seeing all the pictures and there famous black sesame ice cream I had to check it out. We were in quite a rush to meet someone so had to inhale the desserts pretty quick. The inside is upstairs. Pretty small but cozy. The inside was very cute, with bamboo and traditional Japanese decor. Service was nice and attentive. Wish I could have taken the full experience and stayed longer and order more but better than being able to drop in at all._Black Sesame and Jasmine Tea Ice cream. ($6.00 2 scoops per order). The black sesame was indeed the winner! OMG wish I had a whole pint of this to take back home. You can really taste the black sesame. The aroma and hint of black sesame was existent but not overpowering. The texture of the sesame bits made me that much happier, The Jasmine tea was great as well and you can really taste the Jasmine. I wish it came out less melted. Black Sesame is a must!_Chef's selection dessert sampler ($20). Cute presentation. 5 different types of desserts as follows;  Yukimi Zenzai (mochi ice cream with sweet, red bean porridge). This was a bit too sweet for me and after a few bites I was a bit over it. Black Sesame Crème Brûlée. This was good and different, but I preferred the black sesame ice cream rather that the brulee. Definitely not as sweet as your average brulee. _Strawberry Mill-feuille. This was great! Strawberry napoleon take with layers of thin pastries sandwiched with strawberries and cream. Light and fluffy not too heavy and a perfect small amount. _Black sesame ice cream with sesame cracker. I wish this was bigger!! The whole point of this visit was the black sesame ice cream so sad mine was a small portion, finished that within 3 bites. _2 cookies of green tea and chocolate. This was whatever. Did not have much taste and pretty bland. Not too sweet so nice to have with tea. I would definitely come back here again and get the black sesame ice cream and their individual desserts. There lunch/dinner menu seemed great as well!
Agustin K.}New York, NY}703}1004}441}18}2}7/18/2014Updatedreview}Ugh so sad.  Very steep inflation.  I used to love coming here for dessert and will even wait in freezing cold weather for a table.  Those are the good old days.  Their menu is cut very much simplified now so you have limited tea options.  And price went up quite dramatically.  I went today for the dinner set.  Yes it was decent and well executed but we left hungry.  For $24 not sure if it was worthed.  It included chef's dessert choice and both were disappointing.  Some sponge cake that tasted like leftover cake and a lemon of lime pudding.  I guess they can charge this much since the line continues to be long.  You won't find me waiting anymore though.  I maybe at the Sobaya across the street or Ootoya a few blocks up.
Patricia D.}San Francisco, CA}24}57}0}-1}5}7/18/2014}Such a cosy place hidden in the heart of East Village. Has a true Japanese feel. The desert sampler offers more than enough dessert for two people. The sesame creme brulé was truly magnificent. Broad selection of tea. Perfect for rainy days!
Linda C.}Manhattan, NY}2}72}1}-1}4}7/14/2014}Came here for tea and desserts Had the Lavender and mint tea (had them make it iced) Also tried the chamomile and Chrysanthemum Blossom (chamomile was the best)Tip - Cash only.Black Sesame Crème Brûlée is great! Comes with black sesame ice cream on top. It was delicious!
Carrie L.}Pittsburgh, PA}285}240}570}18}4}7/9/2014}I've tried many times to grab a table at Cha-An, but each time was over 1-2 hours wait without fail.  On a rainy July 4th lunch hour, there was no wait and the place was barely seated!  Score!  Unfortunately, I was only here for an after-snack, before-dinner dessert.  So although the menu looked tempting with great items like tea-smoked salmon toast and lunch sets... I was only able to split the black sesame creme brulee.  The black sesame creme brulee comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream.  To top that off, it has a sweet sesame rice chip.  This dessert is definitely on the sweeter side.  The creme brulee doesn't have a very thick crisp layer on top, the texture is creamy and rich.  The flavor all blend together, although well, but not as orgasmic as I thought it would be.  I hope to return and try some of their savory dishes next time.  We also ordered the matcha latte, with red beans on top.  Not bad!  Cha-An is great, but my friends have definitely hyped it up for me.
Elena K.}New York, NY}3}21}2}-1}2}7/8/2014}Nice place and good service. We tried only desserts, but for the price they were not good at all. We trusted the reviews and tried the Sesame Brûlée and chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce. It wasn't good :( left disappointed.
Piper M.}Brooklyn, NY}18}95}7}-1}5}7/5/2014}Stopped in here for some Japanese comfort food on a super hot day and was pleasantly surprised to see they had a cold chazuke lunch set. The multigrain rice they use is amazing, great texture and didn't make me feel super heavy after eating like regular white rice does. It didn't get all soggy/waterlogged in the chazuke. All the pickles/tsukemono accompanying it were so good and the set also came with tuna tataki, which had subtle but really good flavoring to it. At the end of the meal i even got dessert! The only thing that I wished it came with was some tea. Tea was I think a $4-5 add on, which I felt was a little too much to spend on a drink for lunch. I'll definitely come back to try their other food and desserts.
Wenyen H.}Gaithersburg, MD}193}56}0}-1}4}7/3/2014}Well, it's really rare to find a good and "real" Japanese tea snack shop in east coast, even in New York, there's only one. I would like to recommend this restuarant to those who love Japanese sweet and don't have the chance to visit Japan any time soon.
Patricia M.}Seattle, WA}210}140}885}-1}4}7/3/2014}Cute little place with awesome desserts!Pros-the setting is intimate yet the seating isnt cramped -the desserts were ridiculously good (the fruit parfait was unique because it had sesame-like cookie crumbs that gave it a nice twist; the black sesame ice cream was so good...not too sweet and very flavorful)-service was great (kept refilling our water)-the savory foods looked great as well (notably the salmon bread). Their food seems healthy and filling so I'll have to try it next time! They have lunch specials on weekdays!-very clean restroom Cons-this is a relatively pricey place. (I think my parfait was $9...yikes)-they won't seat you till your whole party is here (typical for nyc restaurants though)Definitely coming back here for lunch/dinner!
Tiffany C.}New York, NY}212}371}688}-1}5}7/1/2014}This is such a gem! This is an authentic Japanese tea house with some small dishes and lovely desserts. I recommend their toast which is a sweet dessert that is enough to share between two people. It's a huge piece of toast with whipped cream, green tea ice-cream and raspberry sauce. The toast is thick and crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. The combination of all the flavors together is like no other hitting your palette at different times from when you first bite into it.  It's definitely an experience worth trying. They're also known for their matcha green tea.
Karen W.}New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}6/29/2014}It's great for people who crave for Japanese desserts that are not too sweet. Good service, except cash only.
Carol W.}New York, NY}9}70}3}-1}3}6/28/2014}This place has a nice atmosphere.  I ordered the Set B., ate it, paid, and then went for a real meal at Mighty Quinn. Unfortunately, Set B at $22 had such small items...it was hardly an appetizer.
S S.}New York, NY}13}54}128}-1}3}6/28/2014}Definitely not one the best experience I've had at a Japanese tea house...desserts were way too sweet and very unlike Japanese desserts that I've tasted before. Tea presentation and selection was definitely better than the dessert menu. I may give it another go but not sure when. Will definitely review if and when that happens.
Pauline M.}Houston, TX}161}135}572}-1}4}6/24/2014}Pros- sesame creme brûlée ($9) was delicious!! It wasn't too rich or too sweet.- our waitress was super sweet and knowledgeable of the menu- prices are reasonable and there's a good selection of dessertsCons- tables are a little close together- they take CASH only (which would've been nice if they had informed us of that in the beginning)
Joey L.}New York, NY}131}269}484}18}5}6/21/2014}Came here for dessert after dinner and it was an adorable tea house spot. Delicious desserts and extraordinary presentation. The sesame creme brulee was to die for. It was not overwhelming or too light. The texture was wonderful and soft. It was like a piece of heaven in my mouth. This is perfect for someone who does not like overly sweet desserts. My sister got the dessert sampler and that was a great choice for those who cannot decide on one. It had a mini version of the sesame creme brulee plus several other small desserts that I cannot recall right now. That was delicious as well but I still think the sesame creme brulee is the way to go. Be warned though, this place is cash only and there is a minimum order of $6 per person.
Mel L.}New York, NY}195}20}0}-1}5}6/17/2014}Black Sesame Creme Brule. It was friggin awesome and I NEED to come back one day for another. I highly recommend this dish and this place for desserts.
Elaine C.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}2}6/16/2014}I recently ate at Cha-An and I have to say that it the food (non dessert) is highly not worth the price. I got the combo B,  it came with a tofu and seaweed salad which was actually really good but the "main course" came and it was a small bowl of rice, a small bowl of soup, 2 pieces of fried tofu with sauce, some herbal chicken pieces, a few pieces of salmon on a bed of lettuce and to finish it off, a daily special dessert - all for 24 dollars. Now that may sound a lot but everything could have literally been packed into a pint container. I understand that prices are higher for higher quality things but I did not feel that what I got was high quality nor did it taste amazing. I'm just speaking on their non dessert foods - I'm sure their desserts are a good deal more worth it than the other foods.Save your money if you were interested in the actual combo meals and just go for the desserts as most people do when they go. The strawberry "pie" was delicious!
Aggie H.}New York, NY}69}123}162}-1}4}6/12/2014}We shared the smoked salmon toast, green tea parfait and black sesame creme brulee.  Just thinking about the salmon toast makes me drool...the sauce really complemented the salmon and the greens underneath. The toast was thick and moist, and overall I would have to say this was my favorite! The green tea parfait was just alright. However I may be biased because these type of parfaits don't really appeal to me in the first place. It tasted too sweet and was kind of annoying to eat.On the other hand, the creme brulee was so decadent and smooth. The black sesame taste wasn't too subtle or overpowering but just right!We also ordered genmaicha which tasted pretty good, but I'm not really a tea aficionado so I guess you should take this with a grain of salt.Overall, the ambience and presentation of the dishes were great. The only negative I would have to say is that it's kind of pricey for dessert/toast. I would still come back though!Oh and one last thing- Cha an is situated on the second floor and I didn't see any elevators so it probably wouldn't be able to accommodate those with leg injuries.
Richard L.}Selden, NY}203}114}133}18}5}6/5/2014}Simply amazing. The Red Bean Toast (with sesame ice cream) and Green Tea Parfait were great and Instagram-worthy. The decor is really nice and has a cozy feel to it. I'll definitely be back to try their other offerings. Go here. You won't regret it.
Jing L.}Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY}30}17}14}-1}3}6/4/2014}First, lemme start off with the interior decor, which was really standing out to me, like I immediately had good feeling about this place. We were than seated by the window which I didn't mind so much. When I looked at the menu, I noticed there was a daily lunch special and everyday was different, I really wanted the eel one but I guess I went on the wrong day, I got the ebi chilli and homemade mochi. Honestly, the food was fine. But I'm just not that kind of person to really eat healthy. This restaurant really live up to their healthy standard, so don't get me wrong, their food is fine, it's just that I'm the type of person that like a whole bunch of varieties on the menu so I can choose. Unfortunately, there was a lot of tea options, just not really food wise. & I'm not a tea person. ): the waitress was very attentive and she's always got that smile on her, which I find very impressive. Their homemade mochi was delicious; just a bit too sweet for me. I'm not such a big fam for really sweet stuff, but the texture and the presentation was great. Overall, this place has a nice environment, pretty quiet, good for a tea time kind of thing, I suppose I just kinda walked into the wrong place trying to stuff my starving stomach.
Mary J.}New York, NY}0}6}2}-1}5}6/1/2014}I love this place! The black sesame creme brûlée and the cookie it comes with are so delicious (ask them to add an extra cookie, you won't regret it). Even though I am partially lactose, I still get it! Haven't tried anything else on the menu so can't say if they are any good but from what I see when I look around the tables, they all look pretty darn tasty. Oh yeah the wait gets pretty long so come early and put your contact info down.
Erie C.}Fresh Meadows, NY}7}19}0}-1}4}5/29/2014}I came here for desserts with my friends. They have awesome desserts! It was really delicious and tasty. I've ordered the black sesame creme brulee. I really like the black sesame ice-cream, not a big fan of creme brulees because they are often too sweet. Would recommend to people with a sweet tooth right after a meal!
Sharon C.}Flushing, NY}112}31}18}-1}3}5/28/2014}Cute dessert place. Perfect for dates. They also have food menu but they are better known for their dessert tapas and potted teas. We ordered the sampler. It was a hit or miss. Some of the dishes were too sweet and some were just ok. You have to know what to order to make it worthwhile. I recommended the black sesame ice cream. One of our favorites.
Yue K.}New York, NY}0}5}1}-1}4}5/27/2014}Consider the size of the food, it's definitely expensive. The first visit made me a little bit unpleasant was because they only accept cash, so me and my friend had to walk couple blocks to get cash from ATM. But my impression was changed after the second visit! Totally love their lunch special and deserts, look adorable and fresh tasting!
Geo L.}New York, NY}1}25}2}-1}5}5/24/2014}Awesome cozy Japanese tea house with lots of interesting options on the menu. Strongly recommend trying their high-end matcha green tea.
Josh K.}Jackson Heights, NY}291}1298}39}18}4}5/17/2014}An oasis in the EV, Cha-an is a traditional Japanese tea house with some very interesting dishes and desserts. Their tea is rather expensive, and I feel that most people do come here for desserts. It seems like the sort of place that is popular for "ladies' lunch", girls come in and eat something dainty in a cute environment. Sort of like an English tea house I guess :)Dessert wise I always get the black sesame creme brulee. I haven't yet been here for anything but.Good place to bring a date.
Melissa C.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}5/14/2014}AMAZING!! seriously, you guys this place has the most delicious food! I went with some friends for my birthday and they sat us in this cozy separate room which was really nice and made the night feel special. We pretty much ordered everything we wanted we did the appetizer sampler, red bean toast, tea smoked salmon toast, melted cheese toast and pickles for the meal. For dessert we got the sampler and the Mochi platter. Also I got the Matcha Latte which is delicious and comes in a very pretty bowl, but woah--caffeine! I loved the food so much I was kind of angry which I was eating it because it was going to be over andI couldn't eat this food for every meal ever, haha. I would come back her in a second! My fave things were the red bean toast (it was like a religious experience), the mochi, the black sesame creme brule and this mango mochi thing from the sampler. The only thing I would have done differently is not share the toast, it's not the most shareable thing with more than 2 ppl.
Anna P.}Manhattan, NY}0}36}4}-1}2}5/11/2014}Below my previouse review.As of today, I am changing my evaluation on the tea house. They started to modify their dishes to accomodate the American tast, using garlic, for example..ingredient that does NOT exist in Japanese cousine.Terrible.I truly like this tea house.It is very Japanese, well kept, clean and private. I mostly go for lunch and you have the choice of a daily special or set menus. Anything you choose will be good, freshly made, and delicious. I personally like the set menu but it always depends on how much hungry I am. I have been to Japan several times therefore I have an idea of what is authentic and Cha An is. Only downside is that it is a bit expensive,
Victoria C.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}2}5/8/2014}I've been to this place for nearly 3 years, and yes I see what has been changed and decided not to go to this place anymore. 3 years ago I came here every week, just because I was impressed by their passion and the food art. Yes, they used to have macaron, and you can barely get food repeat on those food set. Then about a year passed, they raised the price, the drink was no longer come with food set anymore, and macaron was disappeared on the menu. The dessert portion was getting smaller, and the food set started repeating several times. This year, they raised the price again, and things either disappeared on the menu or substituted with cheaper choice. I mean, seriously I rather go find somewhere else than spending 30+ in this place, trust me, I'm truly disappointed with this place.
Jaehee H.}New York, NY}144}113}0}-1}4}5/6/2014}5 star food and 3 star service! The desert is so good! Must try homemade mochi and black sesame creme brulee
Marina A.}Manhattan, NY}1}13}0}-1}5}4/26/2014}My favorite spot in the city.  Best to go between Monday and Friday- crowds flock to Cha'an during the weekend.  The lunch special is just what you need: fresh, healthy, elegant.  I had the tuna steak special (thursday)- it was delicious.  The service is impeccable.  Dessert, fabulous!! Sesame ice cream was one of the tastiest desserts I've had in a while (and I am a big dessert person).  Clean, beautiful (you really do feel like in Japan) and zen.  A cherished spot in New York.
Sasa L.}New York, NY}0}1}2}-1}4}4/25/2014}I came today for the first time and the food and location was absolutely amazing and relaxing... The concept of the place is definitely great for people to come and catch a breath and enjoy the moment. The food is very clean and healthy. I would definitely recommend people to try. The only thing is the restaurant is "cash only "and I wasn't aware of it till the end. At least I have cash on me or else I wouldn't know what to do since I went by my self.
Mana K.}Manhattan, NY}41}56}0}-1}4}4/21/2014}I came here with my mom after walking the whole Brooklyn Bridge with my mom on a hot summer night.We decided we needed something sweet but not too sweet. So I took my mom to this place as I always wanted to come here.We got the menu with 5 desserts and they were so nice in terms of presentation. The yuzu ice cream and chiffon cake was really good too.
Sharon Y.}Fremont, CA}94}123}5}-1}5}4/21/2014}I left a little piece of my heart here. I went with my best friend here for a dessert date and everything we ordered was more than my expectations. I am a fan of asian sweets as they are not overly sweet and very delicate in preparation. If i were to have creme brûlée prepared just one way from now on, i would say i want the Cha-An sesame creme brulee in a heart beat. This love at first bite feeling is very hard to find. It was so fluffily and buttery smooth in texture and rich in the sesame flavor there is nothing more i can say but perfection. It is a masterpiece. This was the perfect dessert to have enjoy with someone special. We also loved the tea ice-cream that we had as well that was accompanied with seasonal fruit and a small pancake, sadly i forgot the name of it but it was great. Why have green tea ice-cream when you can have this. The lightest fragrance from the tea ice-cream makes it memorable and just enough to give a lingering feeling of wanting more. This ice cream will make me want to come back for it more. I loved the flower tea we had here, it was fun watching the petals unfurl after watching it be steeped in hot water for 2 minutes .The service here was great and the waitresses were very attentive. It's just sad that it opens so late in the day at 2pm. I wish it opened earlier for lunch time because it could definitely have ALOT more business. When i visit NY again, i will definitely venture back here!
D Z.}New York, NY}3}368}10}-1}3}4/17/2014}Average food. Nice atmosphere. More like Japanese tapas than actual dinner. Cash only. Pricey.
Richard P.}New York, NY}574}84}116}-1}4}4/16/2014}Love this place!  If you are in the St. Marks area, and craving some authentic Japanese dessert/tea come check this place out!  Place is tiny, and there might be a wait, but trust me it's worth it.  Their decoration and ambiance will transcend you straight to Japan.  Their Matcha Latte was delicious with strong green tea flavor and not too sweet.  It went well with all the dessert we ordered and sampled.  My favorite of the night was their mochi of course!  Soft homemade mochi on the outside, and creamy sweet ice cream on the inside.  These were amazing and probably the most authentic mochi I've ever had.  The other desserts were also delicious but it didn't blow our mind.  Of the three desserts we ordered, two of them were very similar.  My girlfriend's favorite was the black sesame creme brulee.  Creamy on the bottom, and topped with black sesame ice cream, this was a dance in our mouths.  This is a must check-out place people!  Go for tea, go for dessert, just go!  Enjoy!
Sharon L.}New York, NY}217}43}59}-1}4}4/14/2014}The food was good I would just have to say that the portions of the dessert could have been bigger for the price of it, but overall the setting of the restaurant was nice and I would definitely come again!
Jannifer H.}San Francisco, CA}352}183}778}-1}2}4/11/2014}Yelp you fooled me! Photos of cute desserts brought me to this place... But taste of the desserts is below par.....Service: Waitresses were not friendly and looked like they don't enjoy their jobs.Food: Ordered the Chef's Dessert Assortment. Got a really really tiny piece of sorbet. The cake was bland and really dry... macaroon wasn't up to par. The tea wasn't bad but still pricey.Price: Expensive for crappy food...Overall: Take your money somewhere else.
Ling Ling B.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}4/5/2014}So quaint and charming with delicious Japanese tea, food, and dessert.  I love the smoke salmon served in a very thick of Japanese toast with watercress and a vinegrette dressing. There is a nice menu of tea. Very delicious and clean food made with Love.
Lytc L.}New York, NY}96}78}7}-1}4}4/1/2014}I love green tea, I have to that this cha an have the best green tea I ever had in a long time! And I loved ever details of this restaurant:) I walked in With my girl friend on a Monday night. We already had dinner and I had a little too much drink, lol. We were seated by the window and a mafia looking waiter came to our table ( is this place owned by 山口组 ） or what??? Lol, but he was kind. Me and my girlfriend ordered a lot of food, a little OD I have to say, but I loved every little plates that came out of the kitchen. The green tea I had was in a black pot and it was like- oh my god! The tea was not too strong or too dry. It is clean, smooth but had a very long lasting flavor:) Again I have to say, I love their green tea!
Sarah S.}Arlington, VA}34}10}6}-1}4}3/27/2014}Like many of the places here, it's ran by Japanese owners and staff.We came here after having gone to 3 different Japanese/asian cafes and restaurants.  So we only wanted dessers, after looking at numerous yelp reviews we decided that it'd be better for us to get tea and desserts. We got the dessert sampler with 5 types of desserts along with Uji Kabusecha tea.The dessert sampler includesMochi ice cream with sweet, red bean porridgeBlack sesame creme brûléeBlack sesame flanSome ice cream ... 2 cookies??I donno if we've have gotten more if we order the full size but it was pricy for what we got.One note about the tea kettle:  it was extremely small but you can ask for hot water refills.  Wish they had a bigger kettle! The kettle was really cute.  We filled it about 5 times to get the most out of our tea. Average service as they were closing.  We were surprised that we had to wait for 20 min to be seated even on Sunday at 9pm.If you are there be sure to check their electronic toilet ;)  It def made the place a little bit more special.
Sammi G.}West New York, NJ}3}43}2}-1}1}3/26/2014}Very disappointed. I've heard it so many times and had expected it to be nice and zen. Turned out it's a cheap lousy place for students to hang out.When we tried to reserve, they rudely denied; when we talked in, we were blocked to wait outside. When we sat down, we were told there's no afternoon tea service. There is a very limited menu. Desserts are too sweet and some are just grocery store quality. In the end, it's cash only, and we felt like ripped off for what being offered there. Don't go, period.
Lucas B.}Buffalo, NY}22}294}5}-1}4}3/16/2014}Cute busy tea room. We got a desert platter to try several of the favorites. They have a moderately large tea selection and each tea is served based on the type. For instance my darjeeling came in a reeling large tea pot but the Green teas were served one glass at a time with refills. We had 4 people and had to wait but we're seated in a semi private home made tea room.
Angeline P.}Queens, New York, NY}279}462}81}18}4}3/13/2014}In the last three months, I've been here three times. Twice for dessert, and once for lunch on a weekday holiday. I highly recommend the hojicha anmitsu if you're into traditional Japanese desserts, and the black sesame crème brûlée, no matter what you're into.The portions aren't huge for lunch, but I was very satisfied by the unagi kabayaki, available on Mondays. Their tea is also very good, as you would expect from a place with tea in its name.Cash only, and it seems to get very crowded on the weekends, but it's definitely a great place to go to on weekdays!
Sandra K.}Brooklyn, NY}1}67}0}-1}4}3/12/2014}The toast with grilled salmon was great, but everything else was really expensive.
Jing W.}New York, NY}4}23}0}-1}3}3/8/2014}I went here for lunch today the noise level is unbearable. Come on this is a Japanese tea house I was expecting a nice and quite ambience, not women talking in super high pitch voices. I guess it's not their fault... The food menu has very limited selections, desserts are just ok.
Doris C.}New York, NY}141}235}1209}18}4}3/8/2014}i am leaning more to a 3.5, but they let us stay there for awhile so i'll leave it at 4.I've heard about cha-an many times, but never really made the effort to go. Known as a great date spot specializing in tea...it just never seemed all that awesome since there are plenty of wine bars around.  However, I had finished a bottle of wine earlier in the night, so I figured dessert was a good option. We grabbed a few bites and some tea to end our night.Pu-erh brick tea: we each had about a full cup each (2 people). It's a fermented tea that is actually refreshing by having a slight bitterness and warmth. The bitterness ended up enhancing the sweetness of our desserts.Homemade mochi with earl gray chocolate, green tea, and black sesame filling.  The mochi was thin but chewy, just the texture mochi should be! Note that these are not filled with ice cream, these are room temperature and have a ganache/fudge like texture.Black sesame creme brulee with ice cream and a black sesame chip.  The chip tasted of toasted black sesame with a very slight hint of sweetness, but overall it was a more savory type chip. The black sesame ice cream was light on the black sesame taste, was a bit too icy textured for me, but it was still a great topping. The brulee was delicious. Sweet, creamy, soft with a crispy carmelized sugar top. The mix of textures with the chip, ice cream and the custard was what made this a success.Overall, this place is cute for a date and is a good alternative for non drinkers. Additional offerings include lunch, dinner, and sake. FYI, they only accept cash.
Yuan C.}New York, NY}6}141}30}-1}4}3/3/2014}DIshes and desserts are super delicate as all japanese foods; while service is not satisfying.
Taya B.}New York, NY}4}22}1}-1}1}3/2/2014}Cha An was very disappointing. I tried it because it has 4.5 stars on Yelp. The service was terrible (infrequent table visits from our waiter, no water, unclear menu, and absurdly small portions). We got sick from the under-cooked pork appetizer as well :(
Ellen P.}San Diego, CA}61}145}196}-1}3}3/1/2014}This place is amazing but definitely overpriced. I would give it a better rating if it was priced appropriately. I visited this place twice and here's my feelings on itFOOD: The first time we ordered two sets of tea & a dessert set which the chef picked that would complement our ordered teas. The whole experience was very interesting as the staff taught us how we should prepare, pour, and enjoy our tea. You are given an unlimited supply of hot water so you can literally sit there for hours drinking tea... the desserts weren't too amazing but the tea was great. The second time we both ordered the matcha latte with the red bean paste. It was delicious but 90% of it was ice so we were finished in less than 5 minutes.. :( SERVICE: The service was great. The staff was very friendly and informative about the art of tea.Overall, I would recommend this place to try for the experience. The dessert isn't great but it's nice to eat something on the side while drinking your tea. I probably wouldn't come back because I don't think it is worth the price but it was a very memorable experience.
Anna Y.}Philadelphia, PA}130}117}0}-1}3}2/26/2014}I have always wanted to come here due to all the positive ratings on yelp and the hypes on weibo so I was super excited when we drove up here from philly. We came here on a Saturday during lunch time , but luckily it wasn't busy and we were quickly seated.  This place is very small and is located on the second floor. The space between each table is at its minimal , you could easily over hear other people's conversation. Here js what we ordered : Tea-smoked salmon - salmon was pretty tasty but not Amazingly good , the toast under it was moist without flavor Black sesame creme brulee - very mediocre , the ice cream on top was creamy and sweet but the creme brulee itself was just meh Green tea float topped with red beans - i love love love red beans and love green tea so a combination of these two is a winner . This drink was pretty good , came in a tall and skinny cylinder glass.  Try it if you like green tea and red beans Cha an set A - came with the rice  porridge , two sides and a soup . I couldn't remember much of it, the soup had a weird taste to it, I cant really explain it , it tasted kinda sour. Cha an set B - it was some what similar to set A but instead of the porridge it was rice , i like rice better than porridge so that was a plus. But overall it was just mediocre. Overall I was disappointed, or maybe I just had high hopes .
Sasha C.}New York, NY}6}890}459}18}4}2/25/2014}much much smaller than i even imagined. desserts are way over priced, although inventive and tasty. once is enough. it does get crowded so come on a non busy weeknight if you want to take your time here. there was a sizeable number of people waiting for our table so i just felt a little rushed out.
Lu H.}New York, NY}272}526}1859}18}4}2/24/2014}It's a small, cozy place on the second floor. We came here before 3pm on a Sunday afternoon just for dessert. Dessert sampler had five different desserts. my favorite was the mochi ice cream in red bean paste - cold ice cream in warm red bean paste, not too sweet, just perfect.  The black sesame ice cream was very unique too, I wish they gave me a little more... Not sure how busy this place usually is for lunch or dessert, but by the time we left, around 3:30pm, there's a line outside the door. It is cash only, which usually would stop me from going back to a place. But I think in this case, I will be back.
Vicky K.}Manhattan, NY}11}16}13}-1}3}2/23/2014}I choose the Chef's selection which includes five dishes desserts t eat. They all looks so good (I mean the presentation of their desserts) However, the taste is not as good as their outlook. It's kind of boring cause they all taste like the same thing: just sugar and more sugar in it. They have very authentic Chinese Tea but be caution: tea pots usually goes very small, that means u have to ask the server to add hot water every 10 t 20 minutes, so the server will take ur tea pot away and then bring it back t u with full filled hot water, but the server usually take more than around 15 mins to bring ur tea pot back. Maybe they r trying to save water f the owner?!
Lori L.}New York, NY}2199}595}6756}18}4}2/23/2014}I may not be able to appreciate the full range of what Cha-An offers as I have yet to cultivate a deep appreciation for tea. Regardless, I can confidently say it has its strengths; it's appropriately tucked away on a much-traversed street in the East Village and, upon entering, it's easy to forget that you are no longer in the chaotic streets of Manhattan. The predominance of wood, the bamboo screens, and even the small presence of foliage near the entrance of the venue is a fairly evident attempt at making guests feel that they are in Japan. Luckily, at the time we went, there was no line, but as the venue can't seat more than 20 or 30 guests at a time, a wait is inevitable during peak hours.While Cha-An does offer several food options, their strength and variety of menu options lie in the realm of tea and desserts. Appropriately, we selected a tea and two dessert options, but not without much difficulty. Their menu is fairly lengthy, well-illustrated, and spans almost every tea and dessert option that you could imagine.The Pu-erh Tea is, in itself, a fairly interesting and complex tea. Served in a small, black teapot, we were able to get several cups of tea from the tea leaves with several additions of hot water throughout the evening. The tea, a surprisingly opaque black-red color, was perplexing, and several later tastes proved no more clarifying. It has a fairly strong, earthy flavor that I can't liken to any other type of tea I've had before. Despite going through the entire teapot, I was no closer to forming an opinion or judgment on it. Indeed, it is a good tea to foster rumination and the earthiness is a good compliment for desserts.The desserts were fairly true to their Japanese influences; one thing to note is that in comparison to traditional American sweets and desserts, Japanese treats are typically less sweet and with other dimensions of flavor. The Matcha Latte with Red Bean, one of the seasonal drinks offered here, was a warm drink that featured the green tea flavor strongly. It hinted on sweetness, but also had a surprising bitter aftertaste that only made you want to keep on drinking it. Cha-An's ice cream options are a safer option, and I have no complaints about the Sake and Mixed Berry scoops we received. They were also lightly sweetened, creamy, and although the sake flavor didn't quite taste it, were nonetheless enjoyable.Cha-An is different from many other places in the city that skew towards Asian-influenced desserts. While I may not return too frequently, it's worth going to at least once for the experience. It serves as a good catch-up place for a small group of friends or for dates; just make sure to note beforehand that they're a cash-only establishment.
Felicia M.}Manhattan, NY}30}69}29}-1}5}2/20/2014}THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY.Now that that tidbit is out of the way, let me state that this place is my absolute favorite place in NYC. I'm not sure whether I should be upset or happy that I don't live closer to it.LOCATIONIt's located in a tiny place on the second floor. Limited seating and it's always crowded on weekends. Expect to wait anywhere from 1h - 2.5h during peak period.FOODWhile most people come here for the desserts, you have to try their prix-fixe sets as well. Cha-an have only two prix-fixe menu:Kayu: Rice porridge + 5 toppings + 1 side dish + dessertKago: Rice + tea smoked salmon + soup + salad + 2 side dishes + dessertThe side dishes for the sets is seasonal. However, if it's you haven't tried the tea-smoked salmon yet, you have to order that. It's fantastic - soft, salty, umami - the flavor combination is especially good with rice/porridge and is very comforting.DESSERTEvery dessert in Cha-An is rocking but I'm a big fan of their black sesame creme brulee and ice cream. The black sesame flavor is intense and just explodes in your mouth. Cha-An's desserts are quite sweet. So for the best experience, pair their desserts with one of their fantastic teas.TEASOh my, where should I start? I absolutely love their tea selection. They have the usuals (Earl Grey, Darjeeling etc...) but they also have some tea selections that are hard to find served anywhere else (Pu-Erh, Uji Kabusecha etc...). If you have the chance, I do advise you to order one of their green tea selections, especially those that you've never heard before. Each member in your party should select a different tea and have an impromptu tea tasting session. I have had similar sessions with my friends and we frequently ended up swapping teas when we found that we liked the other person's better.OVERALLBRING CASH. Come early or at odd hours for minimal wait times. Be prepared to wait. Come hungry and get both food and dessert. Slightly pricey but so worth it for the quality of the food and service.
Erina W.}Brooklyn, NY}157}290}140}18}4}2/15/2014}I came here several times after a recommendation from a friend. It's a great dessert place and tea house, one of my favorites. The only con is that it is really small and you're basically elbow to elbow with the party over on the next table (unless you go during down-time). They have a wide selection of teas and desserts as well. I can never decide what I want, therefore, every time, me and my friend pick the "Chef's Selection Dessert Sampler," which the chef caters a surprise dessert menu to your tea selection. I have yet to be disappointed from the selection (since they give you many samples). My only wish is that they would be more informative on the samples, since some of them are so good, I would like to order the full-sized dessert. Overall, this is a great place. Highly recommended.
Kyung-Bo L.}Manhattan, NY}1}17}3}-1}4}2/14/2014}One of the hidden place in St.marks. It is obviously good place to stop by and chat with cup if tea. Also you can eat their "healthy comfort" food or sweet deserts. It is bit pricy and cash only..so beware.
Hana L.}New Hyde Park, NY}10}33}50}-1}5}2/7/2014}I love creme brulee...and this black sasame cream brulee was just so sockingly amazing..I loved it so much when I first had it and I am still loving it. Simple just the BEST!!!
Nick T.}New York, NY}69}100}257}-1}3}1/25/2014}** Before you read any further this place is CASH ONLY**This place is definitely a little gem in the east village. Usually stop by here after going to Sobaya or Yakiniku West. First things first, this place is really small and compact, you're probably going to have some sort of wait time when you get there, this place is definitely popular with many people around the area and in addition to that its really really small. There the bar which can probably seat 8 and then a couple tables that they have divided into either couples or groups of four.Cha An is primarily is a desert place yet it functions as a tea house as well prior to 6pm, with that said the food they offer is extremely small in portion so if you're hungry and looking for a meal this place is not for you. Onwards if you do opt to eat here, you're an interesting treat pretty much everything they offer on the menu is well done, its hard pressed to find something that you'd dislike about their menu. With that said there could be room for improvement, the waiting area when you walk up the stairs is just too crowded and please educate your staff on certain policies such as minimum per person. I'm pretty sure me and a friend ordering 18 dollars of food and someone else ordering 9 dollars of food pre tip still equals to more than 6 dollars per person.  But aside from these minor issues its definitely a must try if you happen to be in the area.
Lily Z.}Queens, NY}81}145}77}-1}4}1/24/2014}The place was tinier than I thought. From what I could see it only had a few seats but I'm not sure if they had more seats somewhere else. We ordered the black sesame creme brûlée and the tea smoked salmon toast because those were two highly raved about items. The black sesame creme brûlée was amazing. It was so delicious. On the bottom of the creme brûlée, it seemed to have just a black sesame purée that was delicious. I highly, highly recommend that. The smoked salmon toast was just okay. I've heard people say that it was the most amazing thing ever but I just thought that it was mediocre. The service was alright. It was hard to get them to refill our tea because it seemed like they were never around and if they were they just came to sit people down. Other than giving us our food, it was hard to get their attention. This may be weird, or not really, but I like how this place has Japanese toilets. I just think that they're so cool and I love it when I go somewhere that has these toilets! Anyway, minus one star for the service and the toast. I'm not sure if I'll come back here. If I do, I'll probably get the black sesame creme brûlée again.
Alexandra K.}London, United Kingdom}47}321}515}-1}4}1/17/2014}After walking up a flight of stairs that asked me to hold on to the "hand truck," you make your way into a very cute, dim-lit Japanese-themed room. There is a little hut as well as an alcove to sit in but I was in the general seating area. The wait staff is incredibly nice and they are great at replenishing water because you will get thirsty. Mostly populated by Asians, this seems to be a good place for dinner but obviously better for dessert if you are into Japanese flair. After looking in their silk book of a menu, I decided to settle on a special instead of their famous black sesame creme brûlée. But I made a good choice. -Jasmine Ice Cream: this is incredibly sweet--waaaay too sweet for me, however, the taste of jasmine comes perfectly through.  -Black sesame Ice Cream: it's delicious with bits of sesame in there. I tend to really like the taste of sesame in sweet things. It contrasts nicely. The sesame crisp on top is equally delicious mixing with the sweet sticky toffee or whatever it is very well.MOCHI (sweet rice balls-Chocolate Mochi: the chocolate is very decadent. As for Mochi, it is extremely fluffy and doesn't have much of a flavor but just a weird consistency. When cutting into it it's a bit sticky and doesn't mix so well with the chocolate although both alone taste good. -Green Tea Mochi: the green tea is very thick and delicious.  This is my favorite of the three. -Sesame Mochi: mmm the sesame and Mochi mix so well together and make for a very creamy dessert. Both the Mochi and sesame are very drying so make sure to have water nearby.FINAL VERDICT: I'd definitely go back just to have some tea and to try their other desserts which looked delicious--like the scones, the black sesame crème brûlée and some other dessert that looked to be a drink.  Oh and their Matcha Float.  Magic Toilet: Oh my!  And I almost forgot the most important aspect of this place.  The TOILET!  Before I left I decided to take a trip to the John and only after I had laid my toilet paper down did I realize that I didn't even need to.  I could have pressed the "Wash the Seat" Button.  But I only noticed the magnificent device halfway through peeing.  I then proceeded to have my butt washed (there is a "Wash Vagina" option as well but that would have been a bit too intrusive) and then I had my butt dried.  The water spits out perfectly and in the right location!  I didn't even have to press flush because it flushed on its own.  Me like.  I'd like to own one of these.
Lily L.}Brooklyn, NY}86}56}40}-1}3}1/12/2014Updatedreview}I give it a three star this time...because I wasn't too impressed with my meal this time. I got tea smoked salmon this time. It was okay. There was too much of some dressing on the whole thing which gave it a weird taste and threw off the balance of flavors for me. There was also too many "leaves" (lol veggies) on my toast...The ice cream sandwich that I got was alright. I enjoyed it but I felt like there could be something more to give it an oomph--maybe the little pancakes that sandwiched the ice cream could be warmer or have some special flavor. My friend and I also ordered match tea...not a matcha latte or anything....we excepted it to come in a pot of tea that we could share...but it cam as a big cup. With maybe a centimeter of matcha tea...which was bitter. On the side was so mochi and red bean. It seemed more like a dessert sort of dish instead of tea. We were disappointed--they should specify or put that in a different section.
Sonal N.}Flushing, NY}5}11}1}-1}5}1/11/2014}Love this place. Went today and everything was perfect as usual. Be warned that they started their new menu today which doesn't have some of their usual desserts - not to worry, the black sesame creme brûlée is still on the menu.
Ting W.}Los Angeles, CA}301}45}3}-1}5}1/8/2014}Best date spot! It's quiet and gorgeous.Came for tea and dinner. Dinner was okay. Tea and desserts is where this place shines. Do go for the crime brûlée. Delish! If you haven't experienced the toilet, you're missing out.
Fei Z.}Buffalo, NY}0}2}1}-1}1}1/8/2014}Not that good. Especially service. The portion is really small. So consider if you are very hungry.  We think tea place is supposed to be quiet.  But is so noisy here.  Disappointed.
Annie Z.}Brooklyn, NY}66}50}6}-1}5}1/7/2014}Cute and delicious desserts. I've tried the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, Sakura Flan, Scones, Raspberry Chocolate Souffle and the mochis, they were all good and satisfying. Great service, even when our party of 3 was waiting. I put my name down and was told there would be a 15-20 min wait but if a table becomes available before that, she will call me to let me know! We wandered into Sunrise Mart (a few stores away) and I received a call shortly after. We ran back and got seated right away. Delightful.
Lydia C.}Brooklyn, NY}46}148}238}-1}5}1/7/2014}When I think of comfort food, Cha-An is #1. I absolutely love this place. I have dined here with friends and family and it has always been a pleasant experience. There's something comforting about coming here especially on a cold and rainy day. I always go for the set meals. A few years back, it would come with a pot of tea but this is no longer offered. There is a wide variety of tea on the menu - something for everyone and the set meals always leave me satisfied but not overly full. I especially love getting the 15 grain porridge set. The desserts change every few weeks and I have yet to be disappointed. This past weekend - it was passion fruit flan and black sesame creme brulee. YUM!Come here for a meal or an after meal dessert/tea - you won't be disappointed. You will feel like you've been whisked away to Japan!Note: Cash only and come early/late. They do fill up/
Sherry H.}New York, NY}203}25}0}-1}4}1/5/2014}I really adore this place. It's tiny (usually a wait) and can be a bit loud, but I love its black sesame creme brulee (beautiful richness, nutty fragrance) and zenzai. Zenzai is a can't-miss. The combination of matcha base, sake ice cream, chewy mochi balls, chestnuts and azuki bean jellies offers complexity in taste and texture.
Boki H.}Manhattan, NY}14}177}218}-1}3}1/4/2014}I know this place is more famous for its afternoon tea, but this review is for dinner only. I've heard so much nice words about this place but its dinner is such a disappointment. After a few weeks I can't even remember what I had there. Nothing even leaves a strong impression. But I do remember it was not cheap. Among so many great Japanese restaurants in NYC, Cha-An's dinner did not stand out.  Until I try its afternoon tea, this place only worth 3 stars to me.
Michelle C.}Richmond, CA}127}15}21}-1}4}12/31/2013}This is my first time to New York and Cha-an, we ordered china flower craft tea and the dessert set, which the chief will choose the dessert based on your tea. The choice was great! We loved everything that we had: banana mocha brûlée, pound cake (instead of ice cream), red bean cookie with cream, sesame cookie (a lot of butter), and a lime macaroon. They are really good at dessert and tea!! Definitely want to recommend this place!! There was one thing that was a little bit bothering... Our table was pretty close to others, I could hear clearly what others said and chatted...
Benson C.}Mountain View, CA}454}7}0}-1}4}12/31/2013}Around $17+ for the dish here. I ordered a 3 course desert, starting with a slice of pound cake, then follow by chef's choice of two beautifully arranged cookies and milk pudding, and ends with a macaroon and sesame cookie. Depends on the tea you order, they provide dessert that'll complement the tea, so what's on each person' stable may be differ. Lovely ambience, but slightly noisy. I'd come again.
datu t.}New York, NY}4}15}14}-1}2}12/31/2013}"Microscope food--don't come hungry!"I really love their dessert, especially Sensai--feels very authentic! The combination if green tea, rice ball, red bean jelly, and a bit milk is just perfect. This is the second time I am here and decided to give their $17 tea set a shot. Cost 3 for "3 course" dessert. First course is a mini plate with 2 scoops of ice cream with about 1" diameter. Second course including 3 green tea jelly cubes measures about 1" each side, and a red bean sponge cake cut in half! (Doraemo's favorite food, FYI). 3rd course is a mini macaron and a piece of mini cookie, both about .75" big. All these I can get in a Japanese supermarket for under $10. When I finished everything, I felt totally not satisfied and couldn't help look over to next table's lunch set which looks reasonable portion. I felt I just had a collection of bite size food samples. I am not sure if this is over priced. It might be the food portion it is in japan. I just don't recommend the tea set if you are looking for a quality afternoon tea time! The portion and selection can not compare to their a la carte dessert, in no way. IMO for $17 and this kind of selection, it should include at least a cup of tea.
Elaine W.}New York, NY}299}264}26}-1}5}12/30/2013}At 11:55 AM on a rainy Sunday morning, you'll see a few people standing outside Cha-An waiting for it to open. Been there, done it. At least once.If you like tea and Asian sweets, this is your spot. You go up a narrow flight of stairs into a very traditional-looking Japanese tea house with comfy nooks and crannies. Intimate vibe. Perfect for girlfriends to catch up (limit to 2-4, though - small space) or for couples to get cozy. It can get crowded at peak meal hours and Friday/Saturday post-dinner time. Because of the small space, you might have to wait if you come during those times. Otherwise, there's never a wait when it opens in the morning and in-between meals. Just don't bring a whole entourage with you and expect to be seated quickly.Cha-An has a vast selection of pretty much any green, oolong, black, or herbal tea you can think of. But what will truly grab your attention are the desserts. My favorites are the Sakura Flan (so refreshing!) and the scones. Trust me on this one - the scones come out warm, freshly-baked and crumbly. I had one that was Earl Grey and the other was chocolate. YUM. I've also had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, which I loved the first time. But the second time, it wasn't nearly as good (super creamy, no flavor). The inconsistency has made me hesitant to order it again. Do not ignore the real food here. I've enjoyed the tea-smoked salmon. It's served like a salad with mixed greens if you don't get it on the thick toast (but why wouldn't you?). Their daily lunch specials seem pretty solid.You can easily get carried away by Cha-An's tantalizing offerings and end up dropping big banks--in cash. Yes, cash only. And this is especially important to note because you'll likely spend more than you expect. The nearest ATM is across the street next to Sobaya ($2.50 transaction fee).
Yi J.}Stamford, CT}147}14}1}-1}1}12/30/2013}This is one of the most terrible place that I have been to. Went there with my wife, spent more than 50 dollars (tips included) on 3 deserts and besides the mochi the other two tasted exactly the same! Have asked the server and he does not know what he is talking about, a simple question asking which desert is which and all we get is "ummm.... I think this is the desert with sake.... I think....". This is total crap, the two that taste the same has the same ingredients as well, green tea, mochi, red bean and some ice cream. They need to be more creative in terms of making desert and the only thing seems to be creative is the name of these same deserts with a bit different presentation. And the service... come on, we spent 50 dollars on these stupid deserts and you can't even tell us which desert is which??? The tea is ok, nothing special and services are often delayed, can't blame them because they don't charge for the refill right? Mochi is good but overall experiences is AWFUL. Will never ever go back. And please clean your restaurant, no one wants to go to a place with grade B.
Rodney H.}San Francisco, CA}4983}1218}4124}18}4}12/30/2013}My friends and I stopped over Cha-An after having a hearty lunch at Ippudo.  It's a really nice place to unwind with some tea and dessert.   So yeah, fancy and expensive desserts, but for me it didn't bother me too much because I had a feeling the quality would be very good.I went with the Sakura Flan -- bit.ly/142gEyMIt was pretty good.  Very light , creamy, and not too sweet and had a very nice presentation.I can't really say much more about this place because I only got to try one dessert.  Their menu as a whole looks really interesting and I wouldn't mind coming back to try their lunch specials and pre-fixe menus.
Johnson B.}Manhattan, NY}2}342}10}-1}4}12/29/2013}I like this place. A neat Japanese tea shop. Very good tea and food. And the interior is very nice. Feels authentic.
Helen C.}Brooklyn, NY}43}435}3}-1}5}12/29/2013}St. Marks place has tons of Japanese restaurants, and Cha-an is a great place to have tea and dessert afterwards! My cousin and I got mochi (in green tea, black sesame, and chocolate) which were so tasty! We also tried the sake ice cream (tasted like a very sweet vanilla, not like sake at all) and black sesame ice cream (good but also seemed mixed with vanilla). I loved my chai latte - it came in a pretty saucer set and tasted different than your run-of-the-mill Starbucks latte. This small place was packed so be prepared to wait, but it is completely worth it!
Amber A.}Astoria, Queens, NY}48}159}12}-1}4}12/29/2013}This place is pretty good, if a little overpriced.  A good way to avoid the latter is to go with the lunch special--which they even have on weekends! Yay!Atmosphere is great. I once had a riduclously long wait, with no apparent reason. But fortunately that hasn't seemed to be "normal".
Cece Y.}Manhattan, NY}2}689}618}-1}4}12/27/2013}What a cute place!  Good service.  We were told the wait would be 20 min, but it was only half that because we actually stuck around while others left.  We were seated in the tiny, very quiet, private room off to the corner, shared by just one other small table.  The black sesame desserts are SO yummy!  I really enjoyed the sake ice cream with mochi, green tea soup, etc.  Gotta love the Japanese bathroom with the heated toilet seat.  CASH ONLY.
Angela O.}San Mateo, CA}17}69}11}-1}4}12/27/2013}Really delish black sesame Creme brûlée. We came and waited maybe 15 minutes which is not bad considering it's a small place. We got seated in the smaller tea room which was nice because it was more intimate and easier to talk in.They have the traditional Japanese toilet that warms and washes your butt. Check it out. HahaExperience was really good. Feels like a real tea house and the desserts are definitely legit.
Lavi W.}Plainsboro Township, NJ}37}193}6}-1}5}12/26/2013}A tiny but super popular Japanese style desserts and meal place. The place is so delicate! I like it! We stopped by after lunch. I love their black sesame creme brûlée! So damn good!
Ruilai S.}Monmouth, OR}2}3}0}-1}5}12/23/2013}The matcha and the black sesame creme brulee was so great! really enjoyed!
Kat Z.}Seattle, WA}225}72}11}-1}3}12/23/2013}This place always has a ridiculous wait time, even for a party of 2. The tea selection is very widespread and the teas are all very good (so much love for Chamomile!!!).  However, the desserts are overpriced for a tiny portion and mediocre at best. Come for the tea, not for the food! Overall, it's a pretty cute place for a date or catching up with friends. Also, beware that Cha-An is cash only.
Katherine F.}Reno, NV}127}122}436}18}1}12/20/2013}Thursday 3:45pmI sat down and the first thing the waiter asked was, are you only here for dessert (is that what people only come here for)?... red flag alert hahah. With the only thing but hunger on my mind, I failed to see that the majority of yelp reviews are for desserts and not main courses.. I only saw 700+ reviews with a 4 1/2 star rating, didn't bother reading any, and went for the kill... Big mistake. Tuna (only a few chunks included) lunch special with added surprise dessert picked out by the chef (flan and red bean, actually real delicious except the red bean was a bit too sweet) and added pickle assortment (too strong, too painful to eat).. like a fellow yelper, husband felt like he essentially paid $18 for a big bowl of rice(I'd like to mention that it's yummy grain rice). This meal also included unlimited basic hot green tea (looks prettier than it tastes).  Note, the only have one lunch special depending on what day you pop in... other than that, there are only a few more choices in the main menu for savory meals. Appetizer sampler: composed of six mini glasses of food... none of which I liked.. I could barely finish it... I remember one of them tasting like low budget sweet and sour chicken and the other, a piece of chicken with low budget teriyaki sauce (aka thickened sugar soy sauce). One of the two other meals offered... forgot what was called, 18 bucks.. the quiche was amazing!!!!! Soup yummy, But everything else was not exciting.. and every side dish I received, I already received from the sampler.. double trouble hahha. To summarize things, people only come here for dessert and tea... and I feel like I was ripped off... and could've easily been ten times happier eating at the mitsuwa food court at the grocery store. Things I would order again- quiche and flan. This place has great dessert...wish they also had great savory dishes. Don't mind me.. 57 bucks + tip was just so much for two people (esp for a meal that left us hungry with unsatisfied taste buds) .. we work hard for the money hahah. Lastly, great service and ambiance,  cute ads (though menus are run down and a bit dirty).
D B.}East Williston, NY}94}12}3}-1}3}12/19/2013}First time coming here. Read all the raving reviews. Food is pretty decent however pricey. Be warn place does not accept credit cards.
Joy H.}Olympia, WA}0}4}0}-1}4}12/16/2013}The food was OK, but the desserts were very tasty. Sesame brûlée was my favorite, but chestnut flan & matcha latte were worth it, too.The service was great. The waitress who took our order asked if we had allergies after ordering. Very patient and nice. Will definitely visit again!
Yanny L.}New York, NY}25}40}5}-1}3}12/16/2013}Tea here is just okay. I would come back just for the black seasame creme brulee w. black seasame ice cream. The best I've ever had. The other desserts were just okay.Service is good, teapot was refilled without having to ask and no rush even though they were full/busy.
Amanda F.}Brooklyn, NY}75}40}16}-1}3}12/16/2013}I was so excited to come here for a long time ~ and finally when that day came, I have to say that it was very disappointing.  The food and tea were absolutely wonderful - delicate tastes that complimented each other so well.  It was magical.  The presentation was gorgeous, each plate like a tiny work of art.  But one would think that a tea place would at least be a little bit quiet.  Not in this case.  It was SO LOUD that my date actually had to go hide in the bathroom for a bit to stop the ringing in her ears.  Do people talk in the city anymore, or does every NYU student just screech each sentence?  I wish I could come back here, but to be honest, the food is so expensive and of such nice quality that it is really a waste to come in here and not be able to savor it at all because of the Saturday night bar like volume of the place.  We even went during lunch time, thinking it would be a little bit less crowded/less loud.  No dice.
Steve C.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}3}7}5}-1}5}12/9/2013}Came here on one of my recent trips to NYC.  Definitely one of the highlights of the trip.I ordered Matcha with Redbeans and Black Sesame Mochi to start.  I don't know how they get these mochis to taste so good!  I couldn't stop eating them.   The Matcha with Redbeans was good, but not Black Sesame mochi good.  May be I'll try one of their other teas next time I'm in town.After I wolfed down my mochis, I saw the kitchen putting out Black Sesame Creme Brulee.  Being the glutton that I am, I just had to order one...  It definitely did not disappoint!  Every component from the tuile to the black sesame ice cream to the hard caramel to the custard were executed perfectly.  Loved this place!
Jeanna L.}Brooklyn, NY}261}154}41}-1}3}12/1/2013}This place is super Japanesey. Felt like I was back in Japan & so did the desserts!I shared the Chef's assortment of desserts and each one did not disappoint. The only desserts out of the I think 4 courses that came out with it were the yummy ass mochisGreen Tea & Black sesame mochi - delishI think I'd come back to try the lunch specials and dessert. Just annoyed that they're cash only.
Tim D.}Flushing, NY}204}79}43}-1}5}11/28/2013}I'm not a big desert eater because a lot of times they turn out to be too sweet and stuff that's too sweet hurts my throat when I eat it. Not this place! We had tried the sake ice cream and black sesame Creme brûlée and both were very delicious and flavorful without being overpoweringly sweet to ruin it. I finally understood what people meant when they felt like they were in heaven when they ate desert. Finished it off with a spot of crimson chai tea and I was ready to curl up like a baby and just die. Yep. It was that enjoyable.
Abigail Y.}Los Angeles, CA}0}16}0}-1}5}11/27/2013}This place is so awesome and cute. The waiter was extremely friendly. I had the honey oolong tea which was fabulous. However, I liked my boyfriends silver needle? Tea. The black sesame brûlée was mouth watering and their macaroons are top notch. 5 people 5 teas + sesame brûlée + 2 chef assortment comes out to about $100
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}11/10/2013}Again, I came here totally out of my NYU friend's suggestion. Everything associated with tea here is kinda unique here and even their teapot was so cute. Only thing is that u cannot feed urself full if ur starving. A good place for dessert definitely.
Stephany S.}Manhattan, NY}1}12}0}-1}4}11/9/2013}Cha-An is a haven from the crowded streets. Inside it's very peaceful and you feel transported! I had the green tea mochi and it was delicious. The tea is also very good. Overall a great place for some peace and delicious dessert!
Waikei T.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}0}9}12}-1}4}11/4/2013}This place is super adorable and very delicious. It's a tiny little corner; you basically have to climb up a two-feet wide stairwell in order to get to the actual seating. But the ambiance of the cafe is totally amazing.1) Service: It's great! The servers are happy to greet you and take your order, and they're so polite.2) Food: Well, it's mainly a tea and dessert shop. All the desserts we bought tasted amazing... But it was so expensive. It's definitely an experience, though. I don't know if I would come here on a regular basis (it's honestly a bit pricey, I paid 7 dollars for two scoops of ice cream), but it's a cute place to take your friends sometimes just to show them that "hole-in-the-wall" Japanese tea cafe.Try it! You won't regret it :)
Amanda Y.}New York, NY}4}14}1}-1}4}11/4/2013}Awesome place!!!I went today with a few friends and we (the 5 of us) each ordered one item but it was nice cause we all shared it.We got the creme brulee: I normally love creme brulee and this only made me love it more! It's definitely considered a "must try" when visiting here.choco souffle: Sweet andchocolatey. It does come with rasberry syrup to pour over it but that makes it taste sour so it seems better off without it.Sakura flan: nice nice nice! eat it with the red bean on the side and it's a definite plus.Green tea roll cake: I would recommend this as well. Comes with some vanilla bean like ice cream on the side.Mochi (3 pcs): Honestly, the only reason that this place lost a star from me. It was...b a d. I saved this for last hoping that it'd leave me with a great expression...But none of the mochi flavours (green tea, black sesame and chocolate) satisfied my taste buds.A bit disapponting.On a bright note, I'd come back for everything but the mochi. Great nice atmosphere; dim and relaxing. Hope this review helps! Let me know what you think.
Jessica N.}Staten Island, NY}130}50}144}-1}4}11/2/2013}Great place for desserts.  It's a hidden place on the 2nd floor of some building and it's really easy to miss it.  I came here last night with my girlfriends and we shared some of the popular items.  Here's what we ordered:1) Black Sesame Creme Brûlée --- the best dessert of the night.2) Ice Cream: Sake & Green Tea  --- The sake ice cream did not even taste like sake and I was surprised that it wasn't good.  It tasted like vanilla ice cream to be honest.  The green tea wasn't packed with a lot of matcha flavor, so overall, I didn't really care for the ice cream.3) Mochi: Chocolate, Green Tea, & Black Sesame ----I loved the chocolate one the best.  4) Teas: Lavendar Mint, Earl Grey, & Green Tea.The ambience of the restaurant is quite Japan-like.  The set-up makes you feel like you've traveled to Japan, with the music and all.  Overall, it was a great place.
w b.}Manhattan, NY}8}78}1}-1}2}10/30/2013}The food was really terrible -- we ordered the Cha Kago bento box, and the salmon smelled fishy, chicken was not appealing. The desserts however were wonderful. Will come back for desserts and tea, which it's known for.
Win C.}Fresh Meadows, NY}314}611}2711}18}5}10/27/2013}Yay! I finally got to try this place out. I've been meaning to come here for ages. Cha-An is a very cute and intimate dessert/tea place in the LES. It's very appropriate for a date or a get-together with friends. Their walls are tastefully decorated with bamboo shoots and they have tiny vases filled with REAL mini colorful peppers on each table. Their desserts are creatively designed while maintaining the quality of the taste and texture. We ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée and the Sakura Flan. I honestly couldn't believe how many options they had for desserts. If I had the stomach for it or the manpower, I'd probably order everything on their menu. Cha-An should definitely think about a tasting menu.However, on the down side, it's quite a small place and it's CASH ONLY. I had to eat by the bar because there wasn't any seatings available. I would recommend coming here earlier during the day for faster seating. Definitely will come again and enjoy the whole Cha-An experience.
Yun L.}Los Angeles, CA}48}81}138}-1}4}10/27/2013}Delicious joint. Fall the green tea macaroon and green tea tiramisu left and right. If you're a matcha fan, you don't want to miss this place.
Henry Y.}Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}10/26/2013}This place does not take reservation, and has no order as to who is next.We went to this place, and gave my name to the hostess.  Then a couple just walk up to the front and cut the line while we were waiting. (I thought they just want to gave their names to the hostess), and the hostess actually sit them first because those guys were just blocking the front.  The couple who should be next was yelling how come they got seated ? Those jerks already got seated and the hostess told them they will be next.After that couple is seated, we should be next.  The hostess did not check her list nor call names, but just seated whoever is standing at the entrance.When we confront the hostess, she sounded very annoyed and said, "ok, ok. You are next." Sorry, that completely ruined my appetite.  Will never go there again.For anyone who wants to go there: just make sure you bypass everyone and walk up to the front and stand there and the hostess will seat you first.  Or you can give your name and wait there forever.Sorry, Not my kind of place.
Nhu T.}New York, NY}77}70}162}-1}3}10/24/2013}If you came here for desserts, please skip. Nothing special and quite bland. Almost everything was dry or too crumbly. Everything fell short if expectations.If you came here for tea, please enjoy. A nice selection of tea. Their teaware is not as nice as I would have liked. Seen better at other NY Japanese restaurants. A minor detail though, since for me i enjoy nice ceramics as much as the tea. That is what teahouses are about for me.Can get quite busy on the weekends... Like 45 minute wait on a saturday. So plan accordingly.
Amy M.}Manhattan, NY}51}303}615}-1}4}10/23/2013}Came here after dinner one night during the summer for dessert. It is a cute little Japanese tea room on the second floor. Where can you find a place like this in NYC? It can get a bit busy here, but we were seated right away. It's a bit small too. But the decor is cute since it tries to show the Japanese styles. We ordered the matcha green tea, another type of tea which I can't remember, mochi ice cream in green tea and chocolate flavors, and black sesame ice cream along with another flavor that I can't remember. I don't think the matcha green tea was my thing. It was interesting though. The green tea mochi was okay. And the chocolate one was too rich and thick. The other ice cream was really strong in flavor. But the place itself was good and cute. And a little romantic but casual. However, the place is pretty expensive just for tea and dessert though. And bring cash.
Irene L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}146}119}77}-1}4}10/22/2013}This little place is just too adorable. I came here last night and shared two desserts with my date. I got the chocolate souffle (can't be bothered to find the accent) with raspberry sauce while my date had the mixed berry ice cream and supposedly the sake ice cream (we're pretty sure the order got put in wrong and we actually got vanilla). We paired our dessert with a matcha, although I can't remember the name. All things ordered were delicious. The waiter was lovely and will give you help/suggestions if you ask! The decor made me feel like I was enjoying tea near a Japanese garden. The lighting is warm, and the fact that it's on the second floor makes it so that only people who know what they're looking for will find it.
Queenie C.}Brooklyn, NY}69}125}263}-1}5}10/22/2013}I really love this place. It's nice and quiet, but still loud enough for a regular conversation. The food is light, but fulfilling. The tea and dessert makes me feel at home. Remember they only take cash!
Khanh D.}Bryn Mawr, PA}142}22}27}-1}5}10/17/2013}AMAZING! Absolutely delicious desserts with a clever asian touch. The atmosphere is very soothing and the service is great! It's cash only though
Katherine N.}New York, NY}2}51}33}-1}5}10/17/2013}Cha-An has truly become my favorite tea house in the city. I try to visit whenever I am in the area. My review is only for the desserts and tea as I must admit I have never had a meal here. Here are some of my thoughts: - The presentation of the desserts are beautiful and well-crafted. The tea selection is also great! (I personally really like the Sen-cha)- Some of the desserts I have tried: Zenzai (my favorite)Black sesame creme brulee (very good, but not my favorite)Matcha Float (good on a summer day) - If I am really in the mood for some serious dessert, I like to order the Chef's dessert assortment ($17) paired with tea. - The place isn't too big but I think it adds to the intimate tea house ambiance. - As many reviewers say, the only thing is, this place is cash only and the desserts/teas are not cheap. Also, each person has to order something. If you can look over this little bit of inconvenience and be prepared by bringing cash and a friend that really appreciates tea or desserts... you're all set and I recommend you try it!
Ppmn W.}New York, NY}7}13}0}-1}5}10/13/2013}Feel very satisfied and energetic after having lunch at Cha-An :)
Bella L.}Los Angeles, CA}3}53}15}-1}5}9/26/2013}Well, my brother recommended this place to us while I was visiting, so my friend and I went one Thursday afternoon. Such a lovely little tea house nestled in the neighborhood, you would never have imagined such a gem could be found hidden there. It's located upstairs and the instant you step up from the flight of stairs into the restaurant, you are transformed to a Japan from way back in time. I loved the decor. So traditional!Now, getting to the food... let's start with the ultra cute menu! The little booklet is wrapped in traditional Japanese fabric, with patterns you might see on kimonos. Adorable. Since we had just come from lunch, we wanted to get a drink and some dessert. This is definitely the place for that! We both had the iced Matcha float which was the perfect meld of creamy sweetness and light green tea flavor -- loved it! We also tried the Sakura Flan, Black Sesame Creme brulee, and Matcha tea roll cake with sake ice cream (yes, you can taste a hint of sake in the ice cream). Just hearing those dessert names, does that make your mouth water? Talk about being creative! My favorite of the three was the Black Sesame Creme brulee!! Who came up with this? It was so delicious! I wish I could take it home with me. I will definitely return the next time I'm in New York. Loved the service. Everyone working here is Japanese and so very polite! I highly recommend!
Jun N.}San Francisco, CA}2}39}1}-1}5}9/23/2013}This is a good place for dining. Food is great here, especially if you want a change from those regular Japanese restaurants that serve sushi/ sashimi/ teriyaki, tempura, etc. If you have the time and would like to sit down while enjoying a cup of tea, this is definitely the place. Highly recommended.
Carren P.}Los Angeles, CA}0}80}20}-1}4}9/22/2013}Good place to find unusual Japanese desserts. My favorite is the black sesame creme brulee.
Jack K.}New York, NY}49}325}291}18}4}9/21/2013}Cute little Japanese spot for teas & snacks. Like the decor and atmosphere. Serve an extensive list of teas to pair with variety of snacks, set meals and sweets. Black sesame creme brulee is a unique dessert to try.
Shelley L.}New York, NY}95}429}1107}18}4}9/17/2013}I'm really glad I found this place thanks to Yelp and Yelp reviewers. The place is located upstairs and immediately as you open the doors to go upstairs, you're in the Cha-An experience. It's decor makes you feel like you're in a tea house or at least a really cool cultural experience. I like how cozy it is. It wasn't crowded when we went but I can imagine how quick the place can fill up. We ordered the matcha float, black sesame creme brulee, green tea cake with jasmine ice cream. I am a big fan of green tea so I love anything with that flavor. Matcha float is basically a tall green tea drink with spoonful of sweet red bean on top. Sucks that it comes with so much ice! Your practically just getting half of the beverage because of the amount of ice in there. But it's still a good drink. The dessert was good. The creme brulee was very unique and enjoyable. It has actual black sesame on the bottom. Would definitely order it again. The green tea cake was okay. I would try something different the next time around.
Ning C.}Aurora, IL}1}8}4}-1}5}9/14/2013}great Japanese restaurant! Place is small but they have great quality food and dessert. We tried out four kinds of different dessert and the best one we had is the Green tea Flan. Sake flavored ice cream is unique.
Alli H.}New York, NY}173}595}53}-1}3}9/11/2013}They don't have soy milk here :( The matcha is also like $10 for a cup of it. The quality of matcha is very good but $10 for a cup of it seems kind of expensive.They do the ceremonial thing.
Trish F.}Austin, TX}7}1}0}-1}5}9/10/2013}Great spot for tea and dessert! They have a great selection of green and black teas and all their desserts are delicious.
Yichen C.}New York, NY}82}58}0}-1}2}9/9/2013}I mistook this for a Japanese dessert place and was disappointed when discovering all its choices were Western-style desserts of mediocre quality and the tea selections were poor. Considering that my friend and I waited for 25 mins before getting seated on a Saturday afternoon and that the prices are not cheap, I'd not recommend it for my friends.We had a set of Japanese congee with Japanese pickles and stuff. It was alright, comparable in quality to a 15-rmb congee set in China. Then we also had the dessert collection: cookies, ice cream, tarts, etc. They were alright, but not worth 17 USD together. For someone with the deepest affection for Japanese desserts, this was a major disappointment. Whatever happened to strawberries with chocolate coating, macaroons of different flavors, and ice cream choices of lavender and seaweed flavors? Whatever happened to wakashi (Japanese native desserts)?
Michelle L.}New York, NY}419}266}2381}18}4}9/8/2013}I went to Cha-An a few months ago after dinner nearby in St. Marks with two of my friends. It was pretty crowded and noisy for a Saturday night around 8:30, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long for seats. We ended up sitting at the counter, where we could see all the pretty dishes coming out of the kitchen.The menu says that each person must order one item, so we decided to split three desserts. We got: - Sakura flan - it was really, really light (borderline bland), and I couldn't really tell what the sakura flavor was. Something I probably wouldn't get again because I like things with more flavor.- Sesame creme brûlée - it came topped with a tuile cookie (that tasted a bit burnt but it was ok). The sesame ice cream was really good, and I actually liked it more than the custardy creme brûlée part on the bottom.- Chocolate soufflé - this was my favorite out of the three. It was very sweet yet not too heavy, and the raspberry sauce was delicious.Overall, I liked both the desserts and the vibe here, though I'd like to come back sometime for afternoon tea at a hopefully quieter time.
Kat J.}Manhattan, NY}19}40}342}-1}4}9/7/2013}I have been to Cha-An during a quiet time in the afternoon, and then during the dinner and dessert rush. They are completely different experiences, but both were great. What I love: Cha-Ann has a great Japanese tea house feel. They have a nice tea selection and endless refills on water. You know that they care about the tea, and you can see their hot water dispensers set at different temperatures for green and black tea- just the way they should be. The desserts here are also excellent and very different from other tea places I've been to. I had one of the afternoon tea selections that had a nice variety of cakes. I have also tried the Black Sesame Creme Brulee that was mentioned in many reviews. It is indeed worth getting!As also mentioned, the women's restroom has a very high tech toilet that has it's own novelty value.
Rugie M.}Las Vegas, NV}3}27}29}-1}4}9/6/2013}The moment you walk into this quaint little gem, you forget the hustle and bustle that's going outside and is immediately transported into the quintessential Japan before modernization. The whole concept, from the seating arrangement to the materials chosen, are impeccably executed. Simple is better! The tatami room, is a nice touch! I can't believe they were able to fit one, the whole works! In a life-size doll house! It works for me because of my short stature. I digress, so for the desserts! For some reason, we managed to only come in an hour before closing. On our last visit, we ordered:Sakura Flan - YUM! If you can get pass the way it jiggles, the taste will make your mouth go in a mouth-tastic experience! I don't like jello or anything like it solely because of this but as soon as the Sakura Flan is in your mouth, it just "melts." The flavor is delicate but don't let this deter you from giving it a go! Mochi - selection of 3, we got 2 green tea and 1 chocolate. OK. The fillings were full of flavor! The chocolate, we couldn't even finish it just because of how chocolatey it was, but of course, no dessert will be left unfinished! So my BF man'd up and finish it, followed by drinking a copious amount of water. I had one of the green tea mochi packed because I just couldn't muster to finish it. I wish the mochi to filling ratio was better, there was way too much filling than mochi. Give me mo' mochi please! Green tea matcha - DELICHE! Just try it. You're welcome. Strawberry shortcake - DELICHE! My BF ordered this and he seems to enjoy it. There was a long gap between the last time we were here (a year maybe?) and our recent visit and he has forgotten he has ordered this the last time we were here. I particularly enjoy the sesame garnish, not too sure what it is but I love it!The dessert presentations of Cha-An can make it easily seem like it's from an up-scale restaurant. They are definitely beautiful. I'm giving Cha-An an overall 4.5/5. I would really wish they would have more dessert selection. Service is good. They are always busy so sometimes, the waiter/waitress, they are not as attentive as I wish they could be. We'll definitely come back to try other desserts, and this time, probably sooner than a year! As you should! ATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE: 5/5FOOD (DESSERT): 4.5/5SERVICE: 4.5/5DECOR: 5/5Stay Hungry and Happy Eating! :)
Paul A.}East Elmhurst, Queens, NY}222}38}4}-1}5}9/5/2013}Desserts are excellent. The teas are delicious and the ambiance is fit for pleasant conversation. The service was great: they were attentive to your needs.
Han C.}New York, NY}146}389}80}18}4}9/4/2013}Your possible night:Beautiful bathrooms with bidets,Casual conversations with comrades,And scintillating scones with cups of tea.Order them, wait 20 minutes, enjoy the crunchy crackle of hard sugar crystals, the delicate, steaming hot, buttery flesh, notes of earl grey permeating through the pastry, topped with the tart sweetness of blueberry compote and the creamy hug of lightly whipped cream.Enjoy them with friends, enjoy them all by your sconesome, the scones are a definite eat.
Michele L.}Los Angeles, CA}168}224}1003}18}4}8/31/2013}Here are desserts I've had here:--Sakura flan--Black sesame creme brulee--mixed berries and green tea scoops--zenzaiThis is definitely a great place to have a pot of tea and some desserts for after dinner. Also, the bathrooms do not smelll, but which is a major plus, and their toilets are self cleansing.I love the black sesame creme brulee, but I can live without the sakura flan. It doesn't particularly taste like anything, and it's a bit bland. The zenzai.. let's say if you don't like blocks of red bean and mochi in a green sauce, do not get it  I thought it would just be mochi with the different ingrediants on top of it, but it wasn't.I still love the atmosphere and the other two desserts. The wait for a table or at the bar is never too long. They also have a place where you can sit on the floor.
Rosamund P.}Jersey City, NJ}0}22}0}-1}4}8/30/2013}Great dessert~~well balanced, texture for brûlée is smooth and tenderThe tea tastes good but it was presented in large cup and cooled too fast..the dinner set is very plain.. Have dinner somewhere else and enjoy the tea and dessert would be a great idea~
Elizabeth J.}Ithaca, NY}139}12}0}-1}3}8/29/2013}Cha-an is good, but overall, it is overrated. The desserts here are standard, good Japanese desserts. I ordered the matcha latte which was very good. However, I was disappointed to learn that it was made from powder. If you are charging over $5 for a latte, it should not be made just out of powder! I tried the black sesame creme brulee. The taste was subtly sweet, and really interesting. I would highly recommend that if you do drop by. The decor is not particularly impressive. I know some people might think this place has really nice decor, but I just saw some Asian looking screens here and there. This place takes only cash, which is annoying. Food 4/5Decor 3/5Service 3/5
Amy L.}New York, NY}529}14}4}-1}5}8/28/2013}Everyone who knows me knows i come here all the time.. the dessert here just makes me SO happy. theres something about this cute little tea shop with the best dessert ever. My favorite has to be the sesame cream brulee!
Molly S.}Montclair, NJ}0}5}0}-1}1}8/26/2013}This cafe is totally overpriced and it provided very poor service.  I had the iced tea with scones.  It wasn't anything I couldn't find at another decent Japanese bakery in NY.  As I was drinking my tea the glass reeked of a rank smelling odor and the mini, tasteless scones were burnt all around, except in the middle. In addition some of the staff were very rude. Sure enough  I will not be revisiting. But I'm sure they won't mind as they basically forced us out the door.
Sangwoo h.}Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA}0}2}0}-1}1}8/25/2013}I and my friend were there about 15 mins prior to the opening time, asked to wait at the small space on the first floor by the guy at the counter, since it was raining. But we got an waitress literally kicked us out right after that, kept saying it was the store rules so we had to wait outside in a heavy rain. I have never eaten here, but that a bit too unpleasant experience to have at just a tea place. I won't go back here.
Yan N.}San Diego, CA}3}11}0}-1}5}8/20/2013}My favorite Japanese dessert place in town. Good selections of tea as well. If you don't have any plans after dinner, Cha-An will be a good option.
Mindy Y.}New York, NY}1183}181}142}-1}5}8/12/2013}Wonderful! I have not discovered anything like this place. This place feels special and so peaceful. The service is great too!
Tommy N.}Alexandria, VA}75}170}3}-1}4}8/8/2013}For the experience and ambiance is pretty cool. I really enjoyed their teas and I think their 3 course dessert menu (that pairs with your tea of choice) is really cool. I would go here again anytime I go to NYC and needed a place to unwind a bit and relax. I tried the sampler dish which had an assortment of dishes in adequate portions. The flavors were alright but I don't think I would order it again. Definitely will stick to the tea and desserts.The place is fairly pricey in my opinion and it's very important that you all know that it's CASH ONLY.
Kayla B.}New York, NY}2}44}1}-1}5}8/8/2013}I'adore this place so damn much°* most of the food is perfect!
Clemencia S.}Menlo Park, CA}0}221}6}-1}5}8/8/2013}My fav desserts place in NYC!!!! Because I love matcha and other s ....they have. Yum yum.
Ethan I.}Manhattan, NY}15}12}0}-1}4}8/4/2013}I go here often and its very consistent. They do not necessarily have the best tea in NY but the experience as a great dessert place is always spot on. The service is phenomenally attentive and their tea and desserts are all reliably special.
Christy L.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}223}314}79}-1}3}8/3/2013}3.5 stars. Desserts and teas? You alright. Dining experience? Better than what you're serving.
Jia Z.}Queens, NY}79}206}116}-1}4}7/30/2013}Had the three-course dessert set paired with green tea float. Everything was extremely tasty. Portion was moderate so I didn't feel guilty. Will definitely come back!
Charles W.}Westbury, NY}46}8}0}-1}5}7/28/2013}The portions are rather small and the food is expensive. However, I think people who come here go not for copious amounts of food but rather for the experience and the atmosphere. The food that they do serve, though not in large quantities, is good. The tea house is small, but beautiful and has a romantic setting great for dates. The staff was friendly as well. Also, remember to bring cash because this place is cash only.
Jess C.}FLUSHING, NY}139}98}155}-1}5}7/23/2013}There is something about Cha-an that always brings me back. For example, the Sakura Flan is to die for. If there is only one thing you can get, it's the Sakura flan! You cannot say you have tried Cha-an until you have tasted their signature flan. Get the flan while you can because there is only one chef who knows how to make it and he travels back to Japan a lot! I love everything about Cha-an. Interesting dark-wood theme. The bathroom is decorated with bamboos, a smart toilet which you can choose to wash your behind and blow dry, instead of using tissue, and a wooden slide door. Traditional Japanese ornaments are hung from every corners. This place is cute and small, in order words, your party is likely to wait for 10+ minutes. I highly recommend the following items:1. Sakura Flan $7.5 (A taste of heaven on earth)2. The cha-an set $22+5, which includes:-Today's soup-Two random side dishes (a surprise every time)-Soy milk quiche with mushrooms and scallions (delicious!) -Smoked salmon salad (yum) -15 grain rice (It goes very well with the side dishes and soup)-Small dessert-Your choice of tea +$5 (I highly recommend the Makinohara Japanese green tea)3. Unagi hitsumabushi Don $13+$3: (Sat/Sun until 6pm)-Eel over 9 grain rice -2 side-dishes: Japanese pickle and cucumber salad-Mini Dessert +$34. Hot Matcha Latte $7 This comes with mochi and red beans (A must try for any matcha latte lover!)This is a list of items you can try (or skip):1. Zenzai $9 (I like zenzai in general, but this one has too much flavor/stuff)2. Chef's dessert assortment $17 (Random 4 desserts I usually only like 1 of them)3. Apple-pie (roll?) with ice-cream $84. Black sesame cream brulee  $95. Matcha sugar cookies 6. Matcha Float $7
Stephen J.}Manhattan, NY}76}232}3804}18}3}7/22/2013}I really hate these places that are cash only, especially if you're charging ~$50 per person for appetizer, food, and drinks.  Whatever the reason may be - cheating on taxes, etc. - it doesn't pay off to make things more inconvenient for your customers.Now about the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff from the appetizer selection as well as the entrees.   Although the main entree selection does not look like it's a lot of food, like most cases when you're having Japanese food, appearances can be deceiving.  And the net result is that we ended up with more food than we needed.   Otherwise it was your typical fastidiously prepared Japanese fare that was gentle/mild in flavor.  We didn't bother with the tea as it did not seem all that differentiated - it was however a decent selection of both Japanese and Chinese teas.Service was on-time and the cadence of food arrival was just right.  The only fail was the cash-only issue, otherwise this place would have been a 4-star.
Judeh T.}Brooklyn, NY}24}10}8}-1}5}7/20/2013}My 140 char: Very beautiful place for a dessert/tea place. Drinks and desserts are delicious and if you don't want to make a decision just get the chef's Food Ordered:Chef's Dessert Assortment*, Lavender Mint, Matcha Float** = das the stuff.My Experience:Start from 5 stars and then I subtract:Food: First, everything is super duper nice and cute. The portion might look TINY when you get them (might be good or bad because they are cute) but I came here for dessert and a drink so I was not here to eat my fill. I could not decide which desserts to get so I got the pre-fixed Chef's Dessert Assortment. It came in three courses and each was just perfect. We started with Jasmine ice cream and then a Green Tea mousse cake along side a Black Sesame Creme Brûlée(I didn't even know this was possible) and finished off with a sesame cookie and chocolate brownie. This entire course of course was along side our two drinks which just complimented the course very well. The Lavender Mint is definitely for someone that likes mint, it's light so it goes well with dessert. The Matcha Float is someone that likes sweet things and matcha(super dark intense level). (0.00)Place: Beautiful tea house, has a counter if you want to be close to the action. The environment makes you feel just like you're in Japan, very good place to go for a date. (0.00)Service: The japanese workers just has a way to making people feel welcomed. They would always greet everyone (very politely) and everything is handed with two hands (R-E-S-P-E-C-T) (-0.0)Worth: Perfect score? Maybe, but their prices are very steep. The food and experience makes the price worth it but I just wouldn't suggest coming here for just chit-chats (-0.25)Bonus Points!1) You don't have pick: The Chef's Dessert Assortment changes(everyday?) and you never know what you will get, it feels exciting and the selection we received was a great combination. (+0.25) Final Tally: 5.00 Stars
Rita Y.}Manhattan, New York, NY}86}48}18}-1}4}7/18/2013}Very small, but intimate and cute place for a date or with a small group of friends. I ordered the 3 course dessert and I didn't wait long for them, the portions are a bit small. I enjoyed the green tea very much and we didn't have to ask them to fill it up when it was empty, so the service was very good.
Rob W.}Manhattan, NY}5}45}0}-1}5}7/17/2013}This place is fantastic. The food was great (I had the second meal option; I admit, I wasn't really too sure what it all was, but I loved it), the pu'er tea was great, the ambiance and noise level were perfect--not too loud at all, even though this place does get crowded later at night (around 9 or so). OK, it's a bit pricey, I guess, but it's fucking New York City and I've overpaid for plenty of things I hated, so I don't mind paying for an experience that's this nice. I live nearby and certainly will be coming back. I'm just mad that I haven't been coming here frequently already!
Luna L.}New York, NY}3}157}1}-1}1}7/17/2013}Been to many tea houses and this one is by far one of the worst in terms of the tea and the food they serve here. Firstly, this place is hard to find and you walk upstairs you would find a very Zen like place. It is beautifully decorated, hard wood floors and tables and has serene music playing in the background. There is also a water fall decoration on the side. The ambiance is definitely nice and relaxing. Staff here barely speaks English but they are very kind and helpful. It also gets crowded here. I been here about 3 times now because of the hype here. But would not be coming back because it is over priced and not worth it.I ordered the tea here and it is nothing out of the ordinary. I also had the green tea matcha topped with azuki. This drink is in a small thin glass with lots of ice. It cost $7!!! I literally took two sipps and it was gone. It taste good but matcha green tea does not cost that much. Let me calculate the cost to make this, I can get matcha powder for 40 grams at $5, $1- 2 azuki beans that is already made, milk, and sugar. I rather make it myself and I have and it taste just like this. Another time I had the dessert sampler and it came with tea and 6 tiny pieces of desserts. They were all very unmemorable- there was a biscuit with chocolate, a crispy roll with confection sugar on it, a bite of pie with raspberry and apply, a bite of a baked moon cake with red bean paste in it. This is sooo cheap and the taste lack sophistication. This cost $26. VERY UNSATISFYING!I also had the Mochi- black sesame, green tea, and chocolate- Nothing special here. I would not recommend this place for japanese desserts. I much prefer Panya which is on the same block as Cha-An because the desserts there taste so much better although this place a bakery and is not beautifully decorated like Cha-An.
Tiffany L.}Brooklyn, NY}302}532}429}18}5}7/12/2013}small, cute but comfortable. i've been here for both the set B dinner set and for dessert only. i personally love the dinner set for its homemade cooking quality but others may feel differently if they've only tried the generic japanese terikayki type dishes. i overheard some scowls nearby at the dinner set which deeply saddened me. :( one thing we can all agree on however, the dessert and tea!expansive tea menu to meet all likings and really distinctive desserts treated with lots of love. im a huge fan of anything green tea and black sesame so this place completely delivered on my taste buds. yum!
Julie S.}Jackson Heights, NY}90}110}2}-1}4}7/10/2013}Came upon this plan pretty randomly after a yummy dinner at nearby Ippudo. The atmosphere, as so many reviewers noted, is great. And I really enjoyed the desserts (we had the Chef's dessert assortment) and the black pu-erh tea, a new one for me. Service was attentive and friendly and I thought the prices ($26 for two, an assortment of desserts + tea) was reasonable given the somewhat upscale atmosphere. I will definitely return with girlfriends and/or when mom's in town!
Sharleen Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}22}29}-1}3}7/5/2013}desserts are good. other things are not and overpriced. I'll pay for the food, but leave 0 for tips simply you wait for 10 minutes to get water, another 15 minutes to get order taken, 10 minutes for a menu, and 15 minutes for check. This is a small place so 20 minutes wait is normal for 2 people. an hour wait for group of 4+.
Amanda L.}Manhattan, NY}0}80}0}-1}1}7/5/2013}Totally overrated. We ordered a main course and the chef dessert assortment sampler and it was a disappointed. The dessert dish was so small and everything looked as if it was suppose to be mini-size. For the price that I paid for the dessert, it was not worth it. I felt ripped off.
Audrian N.}Westminster, CA}83}150}30}-1}5}7/3/2013}speechless. never in my life i have tried anything as good as the sesame tiramitsu. It melted in my mouth.I was in desert heaven
Lucy Z.}San Francisco, CA}268}214}338}18}4}7/3/2013}So quaint!Tuesday night, around 8:30 PM, slightly raining outside. Party of 2.When we got there, there was another party of 2 in front of us, and the head waiter said it would be about 20-30 mins wait. He could take our number and call us when it's time. We went to the nearby bookstore and got a call in 20 mins.SO CUTE. Everything was really authentic-looking. It was my first time, but my friend had been here five times, saying that nothing you get here would taste bad.We ordered the flower tea (which did blossom!), the black sesame creme brulee, green tea roll, and a strawberry cream mille feuille. Everything was really, really good. Varying levels of sweetness and each had its own distinct taste that went really well with the tea (green). Definitely good environment for long conversations between friends or dates. I mean, I stayed for two hours and could have easily stayed for longer. But with that said, keep in mind that wait time could be much longer for a table.
Tiffany T.}Manhattan, NY}331}70}39}-1}4}7/2/2013}This intimate little tea spot near St. Marks is a great place to relax, unwind and have dessert. I've been coming here for awhile now and as a tea guru (I'm picky and drink a lot of loose-leaf), this place has a great selection of teas. I myself enjoy their osmanthus, chrysanthemum and jasmine - lighter flower teas are my favorite. It's a little pricey for tea but desserts reasonable.In terms of dessert, I've tried the strawberry mille feuille, black sesame creme brulee and sakura flan. My favorites are the black sesame creme brulee and sakura (cherry blossom) flan but for different occasions. When I feel like something light and refreshing I go for the sakura flan. It's not a heavy flan, more like a panna cotta really and the texture is great. Black sesame creme brulee is a bit sweeter and heavier so I guess it depends on your mood! Overall the desserts are always plated beautifully.The only issue I've run into at this place is that their pictures are a bit misleading - there are pictures in the menu of full plated options that you can't actually order yourself. 4 stars because of this.
James S.}Manhattan, NY}1}60}0}-1}4}6/30/2013}Cute little place, hard to find parking.came here on Sat 10pm. there wasn't any table seating so we sat at the bar.Service was top notch but i could see that all the servers were a bit tired and ready to go home.we ordered Chef's Dessert Assortment (17) with flower tea (5) and mochi (2green tea, 1 chocolate) (8)Total came out to around 40 dollars with tax and tip, expensive for the small amount and mediocre quality of food we got. But its a cute little place for a date and the ambiance was intimate.
Diana P.}New York, NY}322}220}635}18}5}6/27/2013}This is such a cute little japanese tea house in the city! The interior design is cozy and warm. I had lunch and afternoon tea with desserts here with my girl friend. Although I knew that their lunch wasn't what they're known for, we still ordered a lunch set since we haven't eaten anything till 3pm. The lunch sets were expensive, but they were unique and authentic. I ordered the rice in cold bonito broth. That came with 5 toppings and a side dish. I thought it was gonna be very weird because I've never had rice in cold soup before.. that was really odd to me. I'm glad I tried it though, because it was very different from food that I'm used to and I thought it was a good experience. Would I get it again? Probably not, because of the price, not because of the taste and because you go to cha-an for desserts and tea - not much for lunch. They had other weekday lunch specials, but they didn't sound as appealing. The 5 toppings that were given were so savory and unique in its flavors. Every little dish had a lot of depth in flavor to them. I could tell it's quite authentic because I watch a lot of Japanese cooking videos and this seems like what they would cook. The salmon on the side was very good and the side dish which was a warm noodle soup filled with great flavors was excellent! This lunch set came with a chef's special dessert as well, but we weren't a big fan of it. Stick with the desserts from the main menu. We also ordered the Flower tea which was quite pleasant :) I don't know much about tea, but it was very pleasant and fresh. They refill your pot every now and then so you get unlimited tea for $5. Pretty nice :)Since we were so full from lunch, we only one dessert and that was the Black sesame Creme Brulee that everyone raves about. It was definitely delicious and very unique. I've never tasted anything like it before. Its presentation is very different from your ordinary western style creme brulee. It was in a small round bowl with the creme brulee on the bottom and a nice scoop of sesame ice cream on top, topped with a sesame crispy chip. It was SO good and I'm glad I tried it. My only regret was that I wasn't able to try more desserts and dessert drinks over here which means I will definitely be back!! And the next time I'm back, it'll be for desserts and afternoon tea only :)
Danny P.}New York, NY}766}178}43}-1}5}6/26/2013}Cha-An is easily one of the best dessert places in NYC. The dessert they serve is very unique. The desserts are innovative, nothing like you've ever tasted. I've had the pleasure of trying the Black Sesame Crème Brulee, Green Tea Roll Cake with Sake ice cream, and the Sakura Flan, All of which were very good. My favorite and many people's favorite as well is the Black Sesame Crème Brulee- it is a must try! The first bite, I cried a little bit, it tasted so good I didnt know what to do, It tasted like magic. They were tears of joy. The environment is relaxing and calm, perfect place for a date, they play slow jazz music in the background while you are drinking tea and eating desserts.
Trixie L.}Wayne, NJ}17}16}73}-1}5}6/26/2013}Been trying to put off the review for this place because I don't know if I can describe it well. Oh dear, where to begin?? So I did not know what to expect upon coming to this place. It's rather small and there was a wait when I came. I was with one other person (Mr. Bee) and I would have really wanted a table but it looked like people were going to chill around longer so we chose to sit at the bar in a corner. That was okay, I don't mind that and neither did my company. Being that it was our first time, we took a while deciding what to get. (Check the menu, so many yummy things!) In the end, I got the Flower Craft Tea because I heard it blossoms or something magical like that. Mr. Bee got Dragon Well. Maybe, I'm not sure. I have really bad memory but it was a type of Green Tea. My Flower Craft Tea was fun to watch. I kept on getting excited about when it was going to start blooming =] The tea gets really strong if you let the water sit there for a while. Then we got the Chef's Dessert Assortment $17 paired with my tea. We figured we should share because I'm not big on sweets and I might not finish it.I am just so glad we got that because it was absolutely scrumptious! The desserts went so well with my tea, it was taste bud overload. The first thing they brought was this cream-colored ice cream. I don't remember the flavor but it wasn't vanilla. I don't like ice cream and let me tell you, it left me wanting more! Then came this lemon-y cake which also went well with my tea. After that was a brownie with strawberries and raspberry sauce and cream. It was also very good but the lemony cake was more delectable. The last thing that they brought out was a small green tea cake, and truffles I think. The green tea cake I didn't like, but that's just me. I don't like green tea flavored stuff. The truffles were yummy.Overall it was a really enjoyable experience. That or I just had good company. Either way, my first time at Cha-An was certainly memorable and I'd love to go back again. It's a little pricey but as long as I'm satisfied with what I get, it's worth it =]
Kristina L.}Los Angeles, CA}44}43}1}-1}4}6/19/2013}I was happy overall with this place.  I went with a party of four. You have to go upstairs and once you get there you see how small it actually is.  They have wooden tables and chairs and it is very quaint and cute.  The green tea is delicious and the tea is light and refreshing.  Each tea comes with a different teacup and teapot.  You can share dessert and is enjoyable for being alone or being with friends.
Laura L.}Manhattan, NY}219}295}121}-1}4}6/16/2013}Four of us came here because two friends wanted dessert. The other person and I tried passing on ordering, but apparently there's a one-order-per-person rule, so we were forced to order. I ended up getting the black sesame creme brûlée, and it's truly as delicious as everyone raves about. It's not too sweet, and the portion is just right for dessert -- small enough for one person to finish, but big enough to hit all the right spots. And it comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream, yummm.The women's restroom, which is quite well-kept, has a bidet. I highly recommend trying out the functions...it's certainly an interesting experience for anyone who's never encountered one.Cash only!
Eileen S.}Jersey City, NJ}1}13}0}-1}5}6/16/2013}Love their set meal, nice place for catching up with a few friends, with tea, delicious food and dessert.
C.Y C.}Manhattan, NY}15}23}10}-1}4}6/14/2013}It's my favorite Japanese dessert place~ Came here for tea with friends before and it's a cute little get together place, if the wait is not too crazy. But I always come here to order their great desserts. Black Sesame Creme Brulee - i don't like creme brulee, but you have to try this... Sakura flan - it tastes just like when cherry blossom just about to bloom, but not blooming yet. The subtle sweetness is perfect for my dessert requirement. Just a little pink in the white palette. The texture is so smooth, reminds me of home made tofu in EN Japanese Brasserie. Zenzai - if you like green tea flavor, you will enjoy this. I am a huge green tea fan so I love zenzai! Mochi is always good too. But the star is really the sake ice cream! Red Bean Butter Toast - it's pretty good but it really looks better than the taste. They will always have special desserts of the day. I remember getting a raspberry parfait and green tea parfait. Both are very very good. So get the parfait when they have it. Taking a star away because their food menu is really not that great and over priced...
Liv P.}McLean, VA}3}26}51}-1}4}6/13/2013}food selections are very limited and that's what i like about it cuz i get too serious when it comes to the menus. the set menu that i always get is something unique about this place cuz it's something i've never had before at other places. desserts will come in a fancy way and welly decorated. this is a very compact place and the atmosphere is cozy/casual/clean. their restroom is one of the cleanest one you'll find in nyc restaurants
Christina Z.}New York, NY}901}355}342}18}4}6/13/2013}Interesting ice cream flavors and a great place for tea where you learn the correct/traditional process to drink. The wait took awhile, but otherwise it was a nice ending to a long night of food!
Linh F.}Toluca Lake, CA}622}355}817}-1}3}6/12/2013}This place is very cute. The tea house is located in east village (note that it is on the second floor). Decor is traditional japanese.  Dim lighting with barely any natural night.  We came here for the tea ceremony.  It was our fault that we didn't look into it more.  This ceremony is only available on Sundays.  We put our name and cellphone down (this is the second place in nyc that offered to call us when the table was ready!  I love it!  LA needs to step it up).  It took us 25 minutes to get a table.FOOD:  They have a set of rules listed on the first page of their menu.  The main one to know is that each person in the party has to order one item.   We decided to get some tea and the dessert everyone raves about:  black sesame creme brule.  The menu here is pretty extensive...a little overwhelming actually.  If you love tea, you should come here... So many different kinds of tea. We are in no way tea experts so I don't think we appreciated it as much as others.  The tea comes in individual small pots.  Additional hot water is complementary.  I thought the hostess was going to describe the tea or recommend a pairing.  She just politely poured our tea and barely talked.  Good thing there are pretty good descriptions of the teas.  Black sesame creme brule... Eh.  To be honest it just tasted like peanut brittle.  I think I was expecting more.  A plus:  it wasn't too sweet.  I give this three stars.ATMOSPHERE:  I give this four and a half stars.  Very cute.  Loved just sitting in our small corner enjoying cups of tea...a perfect place to unwind. SERVICE:  Things came out quick.  No complaints.OVERALL:  Next time I come here, I want to try their food.  Good place quiet place to get away in the city.Ps.  There is a high tech bidet in the women's bathroom.  This will distract you for a good 5 minutes.
Ken H.}La Palma, CA}466}713}771}18}2}6/11/2013}HYPE HYPE HYPE. This place I would think its a total hype.Yes, they do have very nice decoration. Yes I do like their concept with focus on desserts but I am very disappointed with their food and service.Why am I thinking their food is terrible?  I like Japanese desserts and when I go to Japan I swear that I try at least 1 different dessert places per day but Cha-An's dessert merely reproduces the taste of Japan, only the look of it.Their sweets are lack of layers, sophistication but they do look nice and it is OVERLY SWEET.  It is sweet like American Desserts. I guess they want to cater to American Clientele taste more and dropped the Japanese concept?Service - I know they are busy and I do know they want tips but having a total bill of $30ish and I paid $100 and they asked me, "Do you want your change back?" Are you kidding me? Do NYC people tip 60 bucks which is 2x of their total bill??  Omg I swear this is one of the most ridiculous thing I have heard so far.This place is expensive but not taste-worthy in my opinion.  Lady M is expensive but they are worth it. This place is officially OFF my list.
Shawn A.}Manhattan, NY}10}49}0}-1}5}6/9/2013}Amazing authentic tea room. Not cheap, but worth it if you want the best.
Angelina K.}Brooklyn, NY}25}53}16}-1}5}6/5/2013}I LOVE CHA-AN! Haven't been here in a while but I crave their matcha latte almost every day! Seriously the best and creamiest matcha latte I've ever had! Can't wait to come back for it
Peter K.}Manhattan, NY}432}602}58}18}4}6/4/2013}This place is mostly for women and dates. Everything is dainty and Japanese. The black sesame creme brulee was really good. I'm a big fan of black sesame anything, really. These desserts tend to be less sweet with a subtle nutty flavor.Their selection of tea is also very good and you can get free refills on the hot water.Good place for talking as it is relatively quiet.
Heather C.}North Brunswick, NJ}32}97}0}-1}4}6/1/2013}great for afternoon tea!  the earl grey scone is delicious.
Lili M.}Long Island, NY}3}83}7}-1}3}5/31/2013}Came here the other night for some dessert. It's a cute little place with a Japanese style bathroom! Anyway, the dessert was well prepared and tasted yummy. I don't think they had a lot of selections. It's a cute place to go to get dessert on a date.  Overall, nothing really that special, and I probably wouldn't come back just because there are so many other places in the city and this didn't really catch my attention.
Ashley Z.}Manhattan, NY}0}46}0}-1}4}5/28/2013}The menu is very easy to read and not many choices, but the food there is really light and good. I feel I become younger when I have dinner there, since most customers there are students. I am a big fan for tea, so naturally I really like this place. Overall it is a good place to talk to / hang out with close friend. By the way, it is a cash only place (Sad!).
Denny S.}Brooklyn, NY}213}354}1015}-1}4}5/23/2013}It's pretty cool place for high tea. Is it really worth it to pay $12/cup for a cup of matcha? Dessert plating is pretty awesome and i love the jasmine ice cream.
Na P.}Edison, NJ}110}145}58}-1}4}5/22/2013}Love the desserts there it is the most authentic Japanese desserts in the city! I wish they can expand the restaurant because every time when I visit is always packed with lots of people or long line. They don't take reservation and usually if you do go on a Friday night or weekends, the wait time is more than 1 hour. That is the only down side of this place but other than that my favorite dessert place to go!
Jenny C.}Brooklyn, NY}164}262}298}18}5}5/17/2013}I was really excited to try this place...and I loved it! however, it is very easily miss-able if you do not pay attention to where you are heading. It's a quaint, intimate place to chat with a friend or maybe even to read a book. Highly recommended!
Judy L.}Denver, CO}119}682}85}18}4}5/17/2013}Delicious dessert place. We ordered a dessert assortment and another weird-looking dessert thing. The assortment was great, and I really think was meant to be shared by 2. But they have the "everyone must order 1 item" rule so we ended up getting another dessert a la carte. We got a light Japanese green tea with it for $5 extra. The tea was great! I loved the flavor. Though it came in a tiny tiny pot that would only pour two cups at a time so we had to keep flagging down the server to refill the pot with hot water. The place is not very big. Cash only. I like the decor though it was actually more noisy than I expected for a tea place.
Anya H.}London, United Kingdom}0}31}0}-1}5}5/12/2013}What a lovely tea/dessert place to visit! I recommend any tourists visiting NY or locals to come visit this beautiful and delicious tea house. While on our way here, we got lost since the Google directions said that it was right by the NYU Campus - which it really isn't, because anyone who knows about NYU knows it doesn't have a proper campus. We ended up getting lost and grumpy by the time we got there, but all that melted away the moment we were seated by this lovely old lady (maybe the boss) close by the little set up of a Japanese garden area. We ordered the Chef's Dessert Assortment combo along with some Yinzhen Silver Needle tea, and proceeded to wait for our desserts. The dessert combo included black sesame creme brulee, macaroons, vanilla ice cream with a black sesame cracker, and a really doughy cookie. Overall, the sweetness of the desserts was well-balanced with the tea selection we had. One Yelper said before me was that it was pricey, and I do agree with her. If my friend and I hadn't split the cost (w/ tip) it would have ended up $20/person. However, because the two of us wanted something light before dinner at Kirakuya later, it was filling enough to sate until dinner and only wound up $10/person after we split the cost.One thing that I really did like was how cute the bathroom looked. It was very clean and old-fashioned (minus the high tech toilet). It smelled nice and was very pretty with the flower arrangements there. Oh, and also, pay with cash. I don't know if they've changed their payment policy, but when we went, we couldn't use CCs. Luckily my friend had enough cash to cover me until I could get to a bank.
Karen C.}Houston, TX}8}142}57}-1}3}5/10/2013}What enticed me to come here was all the dessert pictures, I love anything and everything about desserts. We came here after our dinner and it was really easy to find. It's quite confusing at first for me because I saw people standing which looked like they were in a line waiting for a table. I didn't want to "cut" and looked rude, so at first I was just standing "in line".... well, walk past anyone who is waiting to put your name down on a list. The wait was about 30mins, which was fine because we weren't here for dinner. We ended up ordering a pot of Jasmine tea, the chef's selection (i couldn't choose), and a green tea parfait. Tea is tea, nothing really special about that. Out of all the desserts that came in the chef's selection, the only thing I liked was this panna cotta custard and the ice cream, everything else I only took a bite of. It was a disappointment considering that the chef's selection was like $27 for a 3 course dessert meal. The green tea parfait, I only took a few bites of and it was pretty good... the price wasn't too bad either at $10. The service was excellent (I'd give that a 4 star), so no complaints there. All-in-all the experience wasn't bad... then why the 3 stars? 1 for the few good desserts and 2 just for overall. The price is what really really got me... for spending $50-60 for a pot of tea and few desserts, I felt it wasn't worth it. I ended up getting a Mister Softee afterwards.
Lars F.}Setagaya, Japan}45}513}611}18}4}5/9/2013}I have been here half a dozen times and it is always good to come back. I think my favorite is the toast with raspberry butter and whipped cream. That is divine. I have had their cakes and cookies and tea and have never been disappointed with the food nor service. I am glad they take your number if you have to wait so you can leave and come back when they call. And authentic I their atmosphere and decor.
Valerie L.}New York, NY}164}335}8}18}2}5/7/2013}Tried the Saturday special which was unagi don... The seven grain rice was yummy but the eel was ridiculously small. The kitchen skimped out on the eel and I basically paid $18 for a bowl of rice. Dessert was good- tried the chocolate, green tea and sesame mochi balls. Yum. Each was generously filled with rich and decadent chocolate, green tea and sesame filling... However, $8 for three mochi balls was pretty steep. Service was mediocre, they were attentive and refilled my pot of tea but somewhat rude/not courteous.
Dancing S.}San Mateo, CA}64}78}2}-1}1}4/25/2013}I have been to this place twice and after the third time, I don't think I will go back. i went there with a friend for dessert. We ordered a set of chef's selection and they all came scatteringly without a complete presentation. The guy waiter was rude. We also added 5 bucks for the tea with the set. They ended up charging us 2 dollar more because two people were drinking it. Ridiculous! We gave them cash and the woman was requesting 18% of tip and asking if we wanted changes back. Yes, we do. The place only cares about money. They take no credit cards no matter how much you ordered and you always have to order two sets for two people. Their food is cheap home made food and but they charge way more than how much it costs them to make it. IRS should do an audit at this place to see how much tax they invaded by taking only cash, probably the only place in St. marks that does not take credit cards.
Kate N.}New York, NY}41}45}5}-1}3}4/23/2013}It was a nice place. The dessert creations were beauitful. The atmosphere was relaxing. But the taste was forgetable, and a little disappointing. It taste like desserts we could've order at any other Japanese restaurant. It was good, just not spectacular.The tea we order was lovely. We were expecting to have tea leaves in the pot, that could be refill later on. Turn out just a pot of tea and no more.
Char Y.}Chicago, IL}2758}1556}892}-1}3}4/22/2013}came on a late night for desserts and orderedcha-an's sweets nice place with ok desserts but not worth the price!
Phuong P.}Pennsauken Township, NJ}28}120}0}-1}4}4/22/2013}This place is nestled in the village.  A great chill spot after dinner or just meeting up with friends.  Me and a few friends came here pretty late and were seated right away.  The waiters are nice and attentive.We ordered the green tea cake with ice cream in it but they didn't have anymore ice cream and substituted it for the green tea roll cake with cream in it I think.  We also ordered the Flan and Earl Grey and Jasmine Pearls for tea.  Both teas were very light.  They have an intense flavor but are very delicate.  Once you finish, they fill it back up with hot water.  The cake was very flavorful.  Kinda thick for me but it packs a lot of flavor.  The cream on the inside was sweet and creamy.  The Flan however stole the spotlight.  It was so light but had so much flavor in every bite.  It melts in your mouth.  I can't really describe it but you know what I mean if you've had it before.I def recommend anyone to check this place out.  The quality is top notch and so is the service.
Christine T.}San Francisco, CA}846}803}1042}-1}4}4/20/2013}This place is very small so it's best to come in a small group since people tend to sit and talk for a few hours. Came here with 3 other girls and waited 2 hours! Was worth it though, I really enjoyed the black sesame flan and the black sesame creme brulee. Both had a good amount of sweetness to it. Not sure if I would wait 2 hours again for it though.
Hannah H.}New York, NY}55}80}246}-1}4}4/18/2013}Hojicha is good. I like light green tea. Zenzai is creative but its red bean jelly is too sweat. Ice cream is ordinary.
Sally N.}New York, NY}111}160}258}-1}4}4/16/2013}First time trying Matcha, wonder where else can I get that?I also had dragon well, uji sencha, and the sample dessert set. Everything is awesome, but expect to be a little on the pricey side.
Isabella S.}San Francisco, CA}428}171}55}18}4}4/16/2013}Initimate, understated, authentic. Came here for tea ceremony with my boyfriend. Seated in small tea room with another couple. The room was very cozy (slightly stuffy) but the tea ceremony was so captivating I forgot about the space constraints. For $20, the tea ceremony was a worthwhile experience and perfect for dates/out of towners. Stayed for lunch after the ceremony. Had one of those lunch sets-can't quite recall exactly what the dishes were (unagi? something mushroomy with chicken?) but remember enjoying them immensely.Will be back, not as a regular, but definitely for special occasions.
Charles H.}New York, NY}1}27}0}-1}4}4/14/2013}I had had tea with friends here and it's such a nice little place that I came back for a birthday dinner with my girlfriend. We both ordered Cha-An Set B, which is a lovely collection of items. It started with a quiche that was light, flavorful and unusual. There was a miso soup I didn't care much for, but I've never liked miso soup so I can't blame Cha-An that I don't like theirs.There was an excellent eggplant dish and an excellent salmon salad, and while I was a little dubious about pork belly, which I'd never had, it was actually quite tasty, it's half meat and half fat, which is strange, but it's easy to get the meat from the fat with chopsticks (I suppose some people eat the fat, but we didn't). This is all served with a mix of grains, which was fine.Finally there were two deserts. They were both lovely, but since they're not on the menu I'm looking at I can't tell you what they were. My girlfriend liked one but didn't care as much for the other. I also had dragon pearl tea, which was the best jasmine tea I've ever had (tea was included in the $22 price).It's a very pleasant little place. Last time there had been a pretty long wait, but this time we didn't wait as long (half the restaurant left at once, which sped things along). They will actually take your number and call you when a table is ready want to go out and wait, which is good because it's a tiny place with like two chairs to wait on.I'd describe the portion amount as just enough; I left comfortably full, but it's certainly not enough food that I can imagine winding up with leftovers.
Amanda N.}Los Angeles, CA}1457}564}436}-1}4}4/12/2013}Perfect tea room! Cha-An is a great place to stop by in between lunch and dinner (although they serve full meals as well).  They have a vast selection of teas and some delicious Japanese desserts as well.I always order the Flower Craft green tea. It's amazing, and perfect for people who prefer lighter, more flowery teas such as chrysanthemum tea.  They have a really great selection of teas, and you can order most for only $5 extra if you get a food set as well.I've tried a few different food sets, including the afternoon tea and 3 course dessert set.  Some dishes I enjoyed more than others, but it's all personal preference; I would recommend any of their food sets as they all nicely complement the tea.  I especially enjoyed the tea-smoked salmon and jasmine ice cream.Overall, I love Cha-An and think its a great spot to catch up with friends or take a date.  The atmosphere is exactly what I would want from a tea room - light and not too stuffy.  The tea and food are delicious and moderately priced, and I think the dining experience overall is well worth it.Side note: they also have an awesome Japanese bidet in the women's washroom...
Anja H.}Manhattan, NY}13}19}0}-1}4}4/12/2013}I visited Cha-An earlier this week and I have to say that I am impressed with the authenticity of the menu items offered at this little tea house. The interior is constructed of dark timbre, there are probably only about 12 small tables and a few seats at the bar. It's a cozy space, and it's been busy both times I've eaten here. I had the Chrysanthemum Blossom tea and the Set B dinner option for $22, which consisted of; a small bowl of vegetable soup, tempura vegetables, smoked salmon on watercress, chicken teriyaki, a slice of mushroom quiche and a small bowl of 15-grain rice. Followed by green tea mouse with macaroons. The portions were small and presented beautifully on a little tray. I enjoyed the mixture of different flavors and the variety offered. Although my favorite part was probably the tea which had a subtle and delicate taste. Would I return here? Yes. The intimate atmosphere and the quality of the food make it a stand-out choice amongst the Japanese places that line this section of 9th Street.*Note that the restaurant is Cash Only*If you've never experienced a Japanese toilet - check out the rest room
Wai L.}New York, NY}22}29}2}-1}5}4/8/2013}Definitely one of my favorite asian-inspired dessert places in the city!  The black sesame creme brulee was simply amazing!  The sesame was just right - flavorful, not too overwhelming and the cream was subtly but tasty.  It strikes a perfect balance.  Highly recommended if you like black sesame and looking for a unique dessert to try.As for the strawberry mille feuille, you can't really go wrong with strawberries and ice cream paired together in a pastry.  Another winner in my book.Desserts here are slightly pricey, but the quality compensates for it.  I also like the cozy, intimate setting - makes for a great date spot.  Cash only.
Davin L.}Chicago, IL}550}441}114}18}5}4/8/2013}Noriko-san...ohisashiburi desu ne. Ogenki desu ka?Still remember the delicious Cha-An Toast with ice cream and rasberry preserves. And the selection and presentation of authentic teas is amazing.Best place for a memorable and charming first date nightcap. Don't be surprised if she falls for you by the time the check arrives.
Tammy N.}Santa Ana, CA}297}91}144}-1}4}4/6/2013}Cozy, quiet, and great food. I came to this place last year, and I had a great time here thanks to a really good friend who took me there :) I absolutely want to come back here and try their teas!The prices are a bit expensive, sad to say, but great and delicious food makes it worthwhile. You'll probably need to bring extra cash here because they don't accept card at all. This place has a lot of nice desserts, but I don't recall trying any out.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a lot of cash on me at the time, so I went with the cheaper option with the "6 Kinds of Appetizers" set which would run you about $13 with a variety of delicious bites to eat.  I did sample the smoked salmon toast ($12), and it was really good! Looks great too. It'll look like the brick toast desserts you see in Asia, or in places like Taiwan but in a more savory version of it.I wish I had dessert here! The green tea related items sound so good. I also ended up buying  the CHA-AN GIFT BOX as a souvenir. The sweets were yummy, and the tea that was included in the box was Jasmine tea. it came with the pearl (ball) kind.They also have this cute teahouse for private events too. So adorable :D
Elle L.}New York, NY}179}155}2037}-1}3}4/4/2013}CASH ONLY3.6 stars.the narrow staircase just a block from st. marks placeleads to this quaint, cozy tea-house composed of extremelyamiable and polite staff.i ordered the green tea roll cake w/ sake ice cream for $8.50and the black sesame creme brulee for $8. if you have any questions concerning their menu items, the servers are ready andhappy to answer your questions. service time was average,during which i looked about the small tea-house with cramped seating.the bathroom is also small, but enough space to enjoy? a bidet.two 2~3 inch slices of green tea roll cake came with the sake ice creamplaced on top of azuki bean paste, topped with a tuille biscuit.the cake was soft and spongy and the filling having a light green tea taste. it seemed average to me, only slightly better than roll cakes you canbuy at sunrise mart. the sake ice cream had a tiny subtle hint of sake taste,which was thankfully compensated by the crisp tuille and the savory yetsweet azuki bean paste. as for the black sesame creme brulee, it came in a small cup,the cream custard filling half of it and the ice cream and tuille filling the upper half. if i can remember correctly, the custard was warm, which was an interesting combination to pair with a cold ice cream.the cool and not so flavorful ice cream balanced out the custardthat perhaps could have been overtly sweet.i would return again to cha-an, but i remain loyal to kyotofu for japanese/asian desserts.
Daphne L.}Elmhurst, NY}151}55}5}-1}5}4/1/2013}Japanese Tea House with great desserts.... I'm sold.Sake ice cream and green tea roll cake are to die for. I didn't really try sake ice cream anywhere else but it's definitely some unique ice cream flavor. They have a HUGE selection of tea. The waiter can recommend what you like according to your taste :) great place for tea lovers!Price range is decent :)
Alex H.}Flushing, NY}28}111}5}-1}3}4/1/2013}Two words: sakura flan. Inside was nice but loud, very loud. Probably too loud to sit and read a book or have an intimate date. The tea room looked lovely and if that was open to walk ins, I think my stars would have gone up a few notches. Otherwise, the tables where you sit are just OK.I'd have given this place two stars if not for the flan, which gets a full 5/5. Can't say I understand why it's SO popular considering the prices. Genmaccha was, I think, $7-8. I was expecting a large amount of it for that price but you get a single cup! They just pour boiling water over your used leaves if you ask for it, which is all well and good but for that price, I expect at least another pot of freshly brewed tea after I've reused by leaves. You can get a 1/4 lb (more than it sounds) at Fairway for $5.45, so... I think I'll avoid the teas here. The sakura flan was to die for. It was $8, which kind of shocked me, but this is a perfectly made flan that is absolutely delicious. Cleaved perfectly and tasted like spring. I had a hard time keeping dining partners away!The black sesame creme brulee ice cream was delicious, again at $8. I'd get the flan again but this is a good choice if they don't have the flan.Nice place. Popular with the college crowd that resides in the area. Prepare for a wait, though.
Wendy C.}Manhattan, NY}196}32}20}-1}5}3/26/2013}My favorite dessert spot so far! I LOVE the atmosphere - it really reminds me of Japan. Their attention to details from the decor to the presentation of the desserts is amazing.My favorites are the black sesame Crème brûlée and the toast with red bean and ice cream. Even though I've come here many times already, it never gets old! Would love to try the lunch sets one day!CASH ONLY!!
Van P.}Stamford, CT}0}11}10}-1}5}3/25/2013}Lovely place, good service, and great dessert and tea
Samantha S.}Brooklyn, NY}126}375}44}-1}4}3/23/2013}*cash only*We went to this place based on its proximity to Masak and on the yelp ratings. It was very busy by the time we went in (~8PM), and there was only seating at the bar which was fine. We came here for dessert and we ordered the Chefs Assortment Dessert and two teas: Crimson Chai Tea and Genmaicha.The first thing to come out was a caramel ice cream that contained toasted sesame seeds--- it was more of an icy ice cream and a creamy ice cream but it was refreshing and sort of served like a palate cleanserNext was a black sesame creme brûlée and a macaroon type sandwich cookie which had a  green tea based cream to complement the Genmaicha (also a green tea). I LOVED the creme brulee which had a really unique taste from other overly sweet cremes. I didn't care for the macaroon but Armin L. did.The last thing that came was a matcha cookie and a chocolaty truffle. That truffle was amazing but I didn't care for the cookie because it was more crumbly than soft which is what I normally crave.I would definitely like to come back to try some meals but on a redo I could have more Genmaicha and sesame creme brulee ALL DAY BABY! ...I also appreciated that this dessert outing didn't make me feel like a total fat ass and I have a feeling my stomach will thank me in the morning.
Audrey T.}Manhattan, NY}32}228}13}-1}4}3/18/2013}LOVE the desserts here. Haven't tried anything else, but frankly, all I need/want are their desserts.Quaint, charming Japanese-style decor.Equally charming and DELICIOUS asian-style desserts with a modern/western twist. My absolute favorite is the black sesame creme brulee, which comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream. Will definitely be back!!
Lynn H.}San Francisco, CA}184}3}0}-1}4}3/16/2013}The Strawberry Mille-feuille was superb. Nice lighting, decor and atmosphere. It's a little bit pricey but we were here to celebrate a friend's birthday so it is descent.
De Paul S.}Yonkers, NY}9}4}8}-1}4}3/16/2013}Good place with a great selection of teas and desserts.I'm a tea aficionado and had been looking for a good tea place in the city. I think this place definitely fits the bill. Although not as extensive as samovar in San Francisco, they have a good collection of teas that are brewed the right way (no over/under steeping).The chef's pairing of teas with desserts were great! I was skeptical of "pairing" and thought it was their of trying to sell more food items. But I was pleasantly proven wrong.The only thing that I wasn't happy about was the fact that it had more of a restaurant feel than a tea house feel. So it's not a place you go to just hang out and relax. Also, it was a little pricier than other tea houses I've been to.Putting that aside, if you're in the mood for a great cup tea even late in the evening, check them out. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
Jojo G.}New York, NY}180}219}40}-1}5}3/14/2013}Ohhh I love this cute place. Dish is awesome and their dessert is fantastic! Cash only though.
Jason H.}Manhattan, NY}534}379}2}18}4}3/13/2013}We had the salmon tartare special and the cha kong.  It was all very good - delicate and flavorful, and all excellent with tea.  Wonderful atmosphere and ambiance.  Small dining area though.
Liv L.}New York, NY}108}41}36}-1}4}3/12/2013}The Black Sesame Creme Brûlée is unique and tasty.  The staff was polite and kind, but the service was slow; however, this isn't a quick dining in-and-out type of place.  We will be back to taste from their abundant selection of teas, but so far their desserts are great!
Lucia L.}New York, NY}223}31}0}-1}5}3/12/2013}It's been 6 years living/working in the east village and I'm sad to say that it's only been recently that I've tried this place for the first time!  My friend and I ordered the 3-course dessert tasting menu.  We were a little apprehensive about both getting the same thing and worried that we won't be able to share and have too much left over.  However, they make the tasting so that it pairs well with your tea.  Since we both got different kinds of green tea, we were served completely different desserts and got to try 6 different desserts.The tea was very yummy too--surprising because I didn't think that tea had that much of a taste.  The green tea is prepared perfectly and they were very attentive at refilling our pots.  I will definitely recommend to people who want a legit Japanese tea house experience.  I have to come back for their afternoon tea!
Raja T.}Washington, DC}25}59}0}-1}4}3/11/2013}The ambience is the perfect date spot. They have  a traditional tea room as well. When I think something NYC I think of this place.Cute and cozy tucked away on the second floor.The teas are variied and reasonably priced.The staff was fantastic.I was not a fan of the lighter teas however-only disclaimer.
Lena X.}Manhattan, NY}105}114}64}-1}3}3/7/2013}This place is good, but I don't know what the hype is about. I'm giving it a 3.5 stars (rounding down to account for hype/balance out people who are dumping five stars in a row), below are some favorites:Strawberry creme pie/mille feuille $8.50 (favorite, probably)Green tea roll cake with sake ice cream (this is actually just okay/not bad, but not amazing like everyone claims it is)Lunch box special (now $12 ish, I think--lots of rice, not that much meat but understandable for what you are paying)Matcha green tea + red bean drink thingOverall, a good spot to go if it's not a weekend night, and you are feeling some not-sugar and butter drenched dessert. Also a good response to the question of why Asians are not usually obese (though I know some unfortunate exceptions--too bad).
Corey M.}Manhattan, NY}49}132}2}-1}5}3/6/2013}top notch food, pastries and tea. The kitchen is full of people making things fresh daily and the staff is very attentive. It is such a pretty place too.
Freefinder N.}Manhattan, NY}2}25}3}-1}5}3/3/2013}Wow! This place is something else. I will continue to go there until I make sure I ordered everything in the menu:)I went there with a group of friends after brunch for deserts and drinks. We had chocolate cake with raspberry, black sesame creme brule, sake and different types of green tea. The service, ambiance, people, food, drinks, all and all was a fantastic experience. 5 stars Cha-An!! You are one of my favorite spots in the city.
Chau T.}Fairfax, VA}100}32}87}-1}5}3/2/2013}Dessert heaven! I didnt have any expectations and came here after craving for some asian influenced dessert.  EVERYTHING was delightful.  The black sesame creme brûlée has such an amazing texture and taste, the red bean toast (add a side of jasmine ice cream for a subtle but slightly sweet with a fragrant flavor) is one of the best dessert toasts ive had.  I can never go back to regular flan now that ive has the earl grey flan - try it!! In fact, have the chef dessert sampler and then order a few more desserts on the side, you wont be dissapointed.
Lindsey S.}Manhattan, NY}227}115}164}-1}3}3/1/2013}* Disclaimer: limited to tea & dessert experience ONLY!Pros: Cute, cozy place for couples or girlfriendsCons: small space, vanilla-tasting sake ice creamTip: They might scare u away by saying the wait is like 40 mins to an hr, but we were seated after 15! Try ur luck, instead of just walking away.  It hurts my soul to say this but!!! I was NOT blown away by the desserts!!! And even if ur craving matcha ice cream, don't come here with guys only; u will find urself in Mars cuz this place is for couples and groups of girls.  So! I had the followings;- Zenzai: refreshing with the cool matcha tea, sake ice cream, red bean jelly, etc. BUT!!! WHERE THE HELL IS THE SAKE FLAVOR? It tasted like vanilla ice cream. And to be honest, I would have thought it was some cheap vanilla ice cream if i hadn't seen those tiny bits of vanilla bean specks. - Green tea cake & Sake Ice Cream: AGAIN! WHERE IS SAKE FLAVOR??? The green tea roll cakes were amazing tho. Loved them! :)- Yuzu Saketini: this was AMAZING! For $8, it is just divine. It has tangerine like flavor and I absolutely loved till the last drop. - Unfiltered Sake: I like unfiltered sake. I loved it. :) The staff were very accommodating and kind. I left some of the green tea roll cakes for my dog, and the waitress brought me some bag to wrap it. :) She was really nice. So, overall... I liked the role cakes... and the yuzu sake tini, but I don't think it's anything too spacial. I think I can get just as good role cakes from any asian stores...
Bonnie T.}Manhattan, NY}541}373}520}18}3}2/28/2013}Cute desserts but this place is overhyped! I had the Black sesame creme brulee, my bf had a scoop of jasmine ice cream and a green tea ice cream, and another friend had a dessert with a scoop of mixed berry ice cream with some sort of layered cracker filled berry thingy-majiggy. Idk what its called but it looked good. My dessert and my bf's was good but wasn't in the wow-factor for what I have read on yelp and especially not for the price we paid.
Bonnie A.}Chicago, IL}30}127}44}-1}4}2/23/2013}I love the decor here, it was entering a Japanese tea house which this is one haha. The green tea and black sesame mochi were alright but the chocolate one was amazing. The green tea and black sesame me filling were grainy and dry. Then my friend took out half of the green tea filling and stuffed it into the chocolate mochi and it was so much better. I definitely recommend doing this ;). I was never fond of scones but my friend ordered a chocolate scone and it was freshly baked and the texture was amazing. The clotted cream and jam paired really well with the scone. They have a very fancy restroom and apparently the seat is heated too lol.
Lee V.}Staten Island, NY}3}34}0}-1}4}2/23/2013}This place isn't one that stands out on 9th St but it's a gem of a place for a unique dessert.  Someone had told me about this place so I decided to go one night after dinner.  The place is very small....you walk up the stairs and you're greeted by the host/server.I only came for dessert and what they are known for is their black sesame creme brulee which is absolutely delicious! We had another dessert but I can't remember what it was but that black sesame was to die for....you can't come here and not try it!  Of course, they also have a good selection of teas but as you can see the only thing that stood out in my mind was my dessert!  LOLThe place is very cute...and the service was great as well.  The servers are very attentive and polite.  I loved the place...
Karry L.}Brooklyn, NY}97}467}263}18}4}2/21/2013}I came here w a friend on a week night after work, we got seated pretty quickly by the window, it's a very cute and intimate place, dark and cozy ambiance, enough space in between tables so the next table don't hear our conversations. It's definately a good date spots trying to get to know the other person without having alcohol involved.  they have wide selection of loose leaf teas ranging from white, black and green.  I ordered green tea mochi, which was light and starchy, it went very well w my jasmine tea, which was much lighter than i expected from a loose leaves on first brew, although the staffs are very friendly and kept refilling the hot water to the pot, but after the first brew, it becomes flavorless.  my friend ordered a earl grey and one of their signature waffle dessert, I definately like the dessert (forgot the name) and its presentation, crispy waffle w vanilla ice cream just totally melt in my mouth.  I would definitely go back occasionally to splurge myself, just not too often cos the bill can be as much as an average dinner would cost.
C L.}Manhattan, NY}18}106}2}-1}3}2/20/2013}This place is alright. But it just doesn't quite hit the sweet spot for me.The first time we came, I only ordered dessert, and my experience was much better that time around. The second time we ordered the $22 Cha-An set, which was good but left me unsatisfied. It was more like an appetizer than a meal.I would recommend skipping the food and just ordering dessert and drinks.Super friendly staff, though!
Bing G.}Jersey City, NJ}294}191}11}18}4}2/17/2013}I came here today with my girlfriends for afternoon tea and we all loved it. I had the jasmine green tea, and really enjoyed it. We also ordered the seasonal special dessert, the mille feuille with mixed berry ice cream, which was very good. The only complaint I have is that some of the servers had an attitude, and were kinda rude when we asked for more water. If it weren't for that, I would've have given this place 5 stars. Tip: on most of the teas you can ask the server to refill the pot so you don't have to spend $8 for just one cup of tea
Eric W.}New York, NY}17}89}0}-1}4}2/12/2013}I came here over a year and a half ago. I wrote a draft review about menu items I now remember little of, except that they were all Cute, Dainty, and Nice, much like the rest of Cha-An. If you want to level up in cute experience points, or impress your would-be / is-in-fact partner with your knowledge of cute teahouses, come here. Cute, cute, cute.Below are my notes:The sakura leaf flan had a fluffy but firm lightness with notes of fruity leaf flavor (not sure what I meant here, but I must have liked it). My strawberry shortcake was good, with rich cream and picture perfect strawberries. It was encased in a wine glass that reminded me of a snowglobe. My unagi eel was crisp and flavorful; the sticky rice was also savory, more than just brown rice. The egg was sweet and paired well with the pickled vegetables, although I disliked the powdery vegetables which left me mealymouthed.My friend had a sampler with 2 bagels, resembling a vertiginous yet dwarf-sized burger, one with salmon and the other with fruity spread. Followed up by a few pastries, including a scone and a pound cake that was somewhere between liquid and solid, good and heavenly.The tea - I'm not a tea person, but my genma chan was filled with green warmth - a bit like barley. Cha-An offers a wide selection that was a bit intimidating, despite the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.Purple irises and ceramic wares line the walls; slats across the windows. Sheltered rooms verged off to the side for more intimacy. Also, a wide bar with pots stuffed with tea. Service was considerate and helpful.
Jennifer M.}Montclair, NJ}779}835}3573}18}4}2/10/2013}Thank you fellow yelpers! Came here for dessert and tea after eating ramen two block away and was totally copasetic. What's nice about this place is that it's cozy and low key.  The fact that its located on the second floor away from the cold drafts of the winter season and away from the hustle and bustle of the people walking by is a nice change. The ladies that run and work this place are detailed and meticulous. Everything has a certain standard without being too stuffy. Sitting/placement of teapots and dishes on the table are set a certain way. Even the presentation of desserts. Ended up ordering their seasonal Rose Black Tea, my boyfriend the Assam Indian Tea, and Cha-An Sweets (an assortment of cookies, cakes and scone) to share. All lovely, not too sweet, but slightly on the pricey side if you ask me. I guess my only negative about the place is the cash only policy and the fact that every person has to order at least one item. Oh! Do visit the bathroom! The warm toilet seat is nice touch!
Emily M.}Morris, NJ}7}23}27}-1}4}2/8/2013}Cha-An has the best desserts ever!We started out with their jasmine tea ice cream with a toasty sesame cracker, a mango mousse, a strawberry tart, a green tea shortbread cookie, and a chocolate brownie. This all comes as a dessert set for $17. Back then, it also came with a pot of tea, but now it's an extra $5 if you want tea with your dessert. We washed everything down with a pot of Honey Phoenix Oolong tea which was just perfect!The mango mousse and strawberry tart were heavenly! I love Cha-An's desserts because they are not overly sweet and a set menu gives you a chance to try a little of everything.
Dennis L.}Redondo Beach, CA}288}504}84}-1}4}2/6/2013}CASH ONLY1 ORDER MINIMUM PER PERSONThose are the two things that I wish I had known prior to coming here. Anyway, we stumbled in pretty late and despite being quoted 20 minutes for a table, we were seated in 10. As we were deciding what to order, it was impossible not to notice the bass vibrating up through the building from the club below. Soup of Day: Miso soup with vegetables - basically a large serving of the same kind of miso soup you'd get anywhere else. The only thing is, I love miso soup.Black Sesame Creme Brulee served with black sesame ice cream on top - heavenly combination considering the perceived overwhelming amount of black sesame. The ice cream is light and contrasts with the stronger creme brulee. If I come back, it'd be for this one.Soy Milk Quiche - sounds disgusting, but tastes OK. Reminds me of steamed egg custard.__June '12 Health Score - A
Julie B.}Brooklyn, NY}99}515}13}18}3}2/6/2013}Oh, boo. We were so disappointed by our visit to Cha-An. Yes, the sesame creme brulee is very good, but if you've ever had black sesame in any sort of dessert, you'll know it isn't THEIR version that's special - it's just this particular ingredient. So many of the other items of interest on the menu were "sold out" (I put this in quotes because the stickers look like they'd been sold out since 1999), so there were few remaining items that really called to us. Correction: there were some lovely sounding items, had it been the middle of summer, but serving strawberries in February doesn't really appeal.The Matcha latte was super chalky and a little bitter, so I believe the water was too hot when it was prepared, and our server mistook our question about one item and brought us three. We explained we'd only ordered two, and he offered to take it back.  We demurred, feeling bad, and to his discredit, he left it on the bill.  The right thing to do in that situation would have been to leave the dish but not charge us for it.  The tea also took FOREVER for him to bring, and he never offered more water for my white tea.  The service doesn't factor heavily on my review, but it did put a damper on our evening overall.Overall, i expected better. The quality of their green tea roll cake could have been found for $2 or less at any standard Japanese bakery, the creme brulee was nice, and our remaining special dessert (a warm red bean soup) just didn't inspire. We will not return.
Allison Y.}San Francisco, CA}744}384}2}-1}5}2/2/2013}omg i love this adorable little spot! afternoon snack type places are THE BEST! plenty of teas to choose from, and they're super affordable, no more than $10 a pot. i also got their green tea mousse cake with sake ice cream.. it was soo amazing. definitely will be back to try more teas and desserts
Foodie G.}Manhattan, NY}5}117}203}-1}5}2/2/2013}Perfect cozy place for tea and light asian desserts :)
Shuang C.}Queens, NY}239}218}357}-1}4}1/31/2013}The Sesame Creme Brulee was really good at first, because the sesame flavor balanced well with the creamy parts. But then it started to get too sesamey and tiresome. Highly suggest you share it with a friend.The matcha mochi was fine. I've never been a big fan of matcha desserts, but I could tell they made the filling fresh in the kitchen 'cause the tea flavor was intense. Overall a good experience, would come back again for more, maybe even their savory offerings.
Nelson W.}New York, NY}440}535}923}18}4}1/30/2013}More than any time that I can recall, there is a premium that one must pay for decor and ambiance. It starts with hotel bars and lounges, and then it cascades down to small shops and restaurants with a specific niche to offer its customer base. The tea and dessert selection is great at Cha-An, but the quality is not extraordinary for what prices would suggest.  Signature items like the sesame creme brulee are a must-try, but its pastries leave a lot of room for improvement.The great appeal of Cha-An lies in the little space which feels roomy despite the size. Service can be a bit slow but the staff is very warm and friendly. The ambiance is very cute, which one can almost come to expect from most Japanese establishments (large or small). The laminated menus are fun to look, and the presentation of the food is very impressive. Of course, its the ideal place for small parties whether it is for a date or meeting place for intimate conversations in the East Village if alcohol is not in play. Remember to bring CASH.
Ryan O.}Manhattan, NY}13}20}30}-1}4}1/27/2013}SWEET  :) black sesame creme brulee  the best !! love their tea selection  .
Cecilia L.}Manhattan, NY}74}69}96}-1}5}1/26/2013}They have amazing tea and desserts! The black sesame creame brulee wasn't too sweet, just right and the cookie on top really made the taste kicks in even more. Every tea they have comes with a different teapot. Its really unique so it's a must try!
Stace C.}New York, NY}586}302}1944}-1}4}1/23/2013}I am a tea lover, no coffee for me.I've been to Cha An at least 5 plus times.  There is usually a wait and unfortunately they don't take reservations.  Put your name down and take a stroll around the East Village.  This is a very cozy NY sized establishment decorated in Japanese finishings.  The ambiance is perfect for a catch up date with your girlfriends.  They have an extensive tea list sure to impress any tea lover.  Their desserts are delicious. Never tried their savory menu. Tip: Cash Only
LV C.}New York, NY}7}198}0}-1}4}1/22/2013}Used to be my go-to place, but haven't been frequenting this lovely joint as much. Tea menu is extensive and impressive. The bread basket is delicious. Great food and desserts. The japanese always does it right. (Most of the time, anyway).
Teresa L.}New York, NY}255}409}259}18}3}1/21/2013}I was craving something sweet after a dinner at Takitori Taisho, and I knew that the YT's desserts weren't going to satisfy me.  I convinced my friends that it would be in their best interests to continue stuffing their faces.  So 'round the corner we go, and up the stairs we climb.We were sat in a cozy nook reminiscent of a Japanese tea pavilion.  There were plants and Asian art along the walls.  The benches and furniture were constructed of wood, and the table in front of us was the height of a coffee table, not a real dining table.  It might be uncomfortable for people to eat on a lowered table.  So if you have back problems, request a regular table.We ordered the following to be shared among 4 people:1) Green Tea, Chocolate, Red Bean Mochis2) Black Sesame Creme Brulee3) Sake Ice Cream4) Green Tea Rolls5) An assortment of teas.Of the above, I recommend the Black Sesame Brulee and the Sake Ice Cream.  The remaining desserts were still yummy, but I would hesitate to state that these were the best Japanese desserts you could get in the city.  In fact, I think the desserts offered at Takahachi Bakery surpass in terms of quality for the price.
Lisa L.}Queens, NY}3}131}7}-1}5}1/20/2013}I went here with my cousin because she wanted to have some delicious Japanese desserts after our paella dinner just right next door. And oh so delicious it was!It is located all the way up the steep stairs you see. When you walk inside though, it looks like a home turned into a dessert & tea house (like Kuma Inn). Very quiet in here, as well as a little cramped.We were seated after being asked if we were there for tea or dessert. There's always room for dessert!My cousin ordered a Grapefruit kinda combo (from what I recalled). She had Grapefruit ice cream, grapefruit chocolate, and some other grapefruit stuff. I can't recall because I was busy enjoying my dessert choice instead.I ordered a Strawberry Millefulle (I think). It had raspberry sauce over sliced strawberries with a scoop of ice cream, and these delicious sweet, crunchy "cracker-like" thins over them. I think they were called "angel" something. But they were oh so good... Those cookies were sweet, but not too sweet, and were buttered up just right. I would return for another one of this dessert.Also, there was a Japanese toilet there. Needless to say, it was an awesome toilet.So come here if you are looking to relax and just want to enjoy tea time and desserts after dinner. It is a perfect way to end your night.But beware, they try not to take parties bigger than 4! It is a very cramped tea house.
Ai L.}Anchorage, AK}183}301}63}-1}3}1/19/2013}Cash only... oops.so while my friend and I were catching up over desserts and tea, we were hurried out after the waiter told us that if only tea time, we only have 2 hrs or something like that. I guess if you order a meal then you are allowed to stay more than 2 hrs??? it was kinda surprising I thought. i am not sure if it's posted on the wall or in the menu. but i def did not read it any where. the anmitsu was good and fancy and pricy.  other than being hurried out, the service overall was decent. the waiter knew a lot about the tea they serve. I appreciated his suggestion.
Alexander H.}Manhattan, NY}380}348}140}-1}5}1/18/2013}OH MAN, please let me find a place like this in LA.  The black sesame creme brulee and green tea sponge cake/sake ice cream are to DIE for.  I know there are great dessert places in NYC but for a semi-sweet dessert lover, this place definitely hits the pallet well with not overly sweet desserts, but with the right amount of it making you crave more.  The teas here are great too but I recommend the green tea latte/chai tea latte.  Bring cash, this place does not take credit cards.  Lady M definitely gives this place a run for its money. =)
Colleen Y.}Manhattan, NY}364}195}230}-1}4}1/14/2013}Very charming intimate atmosphere. There were a lot of Japanese speaking people here which made me think "if Japanese people like it, then it must be authentic"Black Sesame creme bruleeSesame is usually a very overpowering flavor but the black sesame and creme brulee was a very delightful surprise of deliciousness.Chocolate sou flee with raspberry saucevery very rich and fluffy. Two kinds of freshly baked sconeslike the chocolate scone but didn't eat the other one, we tried figuring out what the flavor was - we think it was a Taro scone.. hm.. I wouldn't recommend the scone.Assam teagreat pair to finish with the desserts aboveMinus one star because it's Cash Only, No Reservations with a very very awkward waiting area.
Peter M.}Fort Lee, NJ}241}366}809}18}3}1/13/2013}A very nice place to comfortably enjoy some dessert or tea. It isn't a very large place, but it got packed quickly. This place makes you ask yourself, do you want to pay $7 for a pot of tea? Most people would probably pay $7 for a beer. No questions asked. But most people probably wouldn't want to pay that much for tea. However, I enjoy tea and certainly liked the Honey Phoenix Oolong which had a light and sweet taste. I can certainly imagine sipping tea here any day of the week. We also had the chef's dessert assortment (consisted of two mini scoops of ice cream, a slice of cheese cake, mini-mousse pie, a slice of raspberry pound cake and a green tea cookie), which apparently varies depending on the day. I enjoyed the ice cream (infused with some kind of tea) but it was really tiny. I most enjoyed the mini-mousse pie. The mousse was light and creamy and went well with the cookie bottom. They also have sake cocktails. The Matcha comfort was pretty good. Overall, an interesting place to check out. Cash only.
Erika S.}Menlo Park, CA}1}23}4}-1}5}1/12/2013}Were it not for the billion reviews this place has, I might have chosen to keep it a secret--I don't want it to spoil!Go through the door on the street level, up the flight of stairs and it's as if you've landed in Tokyo.  The place is packed, toasty warm and bathed in a gentle light. You can hear Japanese all 'round.  The food, a mix of home-cooked style dishes and deluxe, specialty ones (eg: the desserts), is amazingly good.I went here twice in three days--I was so enamored and comforted by it.  First I went with a friend and we ordered a dinner set with little plates of fish and beef and veggies and dessert. Another evening I went alone and, wanting comfort food, ordered okayu (rice porridge).  Service is efficient and professional and Japanese-speaking, if you prefer.  This place is the real thing. PS The bathroom is gorgeous!  My friend encouraged me to go. I am glad I did!
Leslie V.}Sunnyside, NY}8}33}6}-1}5}1/11/2013}My husband and I decided to have tea and dessert here after our delicious meal at Hasaki. We loved it. We both ordered Mochi - Green Tea for me and Black Sesame for him. I would have ordered one if the other yummy desserts but I didn't want to chance getting a stomach ache because I'm lactose intolerant - yep I know, it SUCKS! Anyway, we also ordered a White Tea to share. We didn't realize that they refill your tea pot so we also ordered Pu-ehr for him and Jasmine mint for me. That was so good and it smelled great. We loved it so much that we decided to come back for lunch 2 days later with our friend. Two days later... I ordered the lunch special for the day ($13): Unagi with rice. The rice was great, it was a multigrain type and was slightly sweet. It was very filling. It came with a genmaicha and for an extra $3 got dessert. It was some type of custard but again since I'm lactose intolerant I had to go with the Mochi. My husband got the $22 sampler which included chicken curry, pickled cucumber, salmon, egg drop soup and some other stuff I didn't get to taste. My friend got the soup of the day, egg drop soup ($6) and rice with pickled cucumber ($6) - I thought this was overpriced for the amount they give you. They also got tea - a strong Green for my hubby and a White Tea for Carolina. We stayed and chatted for a while so that we could catch up with each other. They didn't rush us or ask us to leave despite the waiting customers (we didn't realize it until after we left).
Vivian X.}Franklin Square, NY}264}15}0}-1}4}1/8/2013}Objectively, Cha-An is probably a touch closer to a 4-star rating than a 5-star rating, but in my heart, I shall eternally treat it like a 5-star establishment!I've been popping in for afternoon desserts and girl-talk at Cha-An for years.  The decor and ambience is rather gentle; while you can and do hear the chatter of the tables around you, it's nothing like the din of a dim sum place for example.  The staff here are attentive and personable, understanding quite well the role they serve in the experience of the patrons. Their dessert tasting course and afternoon tea are both fun to indulge in; personally, I like being surprised and not knowing what sorts of cakes and other daily delights they have in store for me!  (The bagels that come with smoked salmon are delicious!)  I still recall very fondly an Earl Grey macaron and a sake ice cream that made me smile uncontrollably.Of course, there are some things that are merely quite good, rather than excellent or delightful, but everything is made with care and warmth.(PS:  They have some great gift boxes/take out treats and the last time I went to pick up a present, they were so popular that much of their offerings were sold out!  A waiter gave me one of their black sesame cookies to nibble on while I waited.  They are sweethearts!)
Rebecca Y.}Washington, DC}52}438}361}-1}5}1/7/2013Updatedreview}Black Sesame Creme Brulee is a must-have dessert. Best chai latte I've ever had. Their matcha is traditionally prepared in a matcha bowl with a whisk. Matcha latte with red bean was also really really delicious. The scones are to-die for: they take 20 minutes to come to the table bc they're baked fresh to order. The mochi is perfectly soft and chewy. You really can't go wrong here. This place is very popular among Asians and is cash only. Cozy atmosphere, perfect for an intimate date or catching up with a friend.
Kenny C.}Manhattan, NY}35}43}2}-1}3}1/7/2013}I can't say this is my favorite place. I dropped in one night for dessert after dinner at Robataya across the street and was seated quickly. The first thing you notice is how LOUD the place is. I really expected it to be a quiet tea room, but the space is pretty cramped and you're almost on top of the next table. The tea is excellent, the desserts are only okay. The baked goods can be dry but I think the black sesame creme brulee was pretty decent.
Bette H.}Brooklyn, NY}67}46}29}-1}4}1/6/2013}Came here around dinner time with the boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised to find that we were seated right away. We had decided on what we wanted to eat, but service took a while to get to us. We ordered the Afternoon Tea Set (which goes until 7PM- got there just in time!), Chef's Recommendation Dessert Set, and Smoked Salmon Toast.We loved 2/3 things we ordered. The Afternoon Tea Set came with two mini rolls, one with salmon and one with a light berry cream. Those were DELICIOUS, and if Cha-An offered a plate of 4 of these, I would come back weekly. Unfortunately they don't, so savor the two that you get for the time being. It also comes with a plate of desserts, two scones, some cakes, and cookies. Nothing too special, though the scones and cakes were very moist and well-textured. We also got a green tea cookie, which was really yummy. I particularly liked the earl grey pound cake. These baked goods assortments will vary from day to day and from the pictures. The waiters' English is good, but it might be hard to catch what they're saying as they describe the desserts, such just assume that it's all delicious! Because they all are.Please, please try the smoked salmon toast. I know that's a huge hunk of bread, but it's delicious, moist, and the mayo and salmon on top of the bread is just... savory and wonderful and YUMMY. You'll understand if you try it!I actually don't really recommend getting either of the dessert sets offered (they have a regular assortment set and a chef's recommended set). Sure, they're plated very fancily, but you also have no control over what you get. We received mango pudding, this green tea parfait, jasmine ice cream, and little petit fours of baked goods that also came with my afternoon set. In lieu of the dessert set, I should have just gotten the black sesame creme brulee that everyone was raving about. That's what next time is for!I would definitely come back and I think that I'd like to try a meal set next time!
Mai L.}New York, NY}213}367}416}-1}5}1/6/2013}One of my favorite spots in the East Village for tea and dessert. They offer some food, but focus more on the sweet stuff. The menu selection is small but the food is always good. I really like their set menus since it offers a lot more variety then ordering a la carte. Most of there stuff is not too sweet or overpowering so it doesn't make you feel sick afterward. One advice is to leave plenty of room for dessert since you probably don't want to eat till you feel like exploding.
Keejoo L.}Alexandria, VA}169}535}137}-1}4}1/6/2013}what an adorable little place, though after reading numerous reviews over the year I expected it to be a lot bigger than it was. Also CASH ONLY. UGH!  I came here for the Saturday lunch, the first 15 or so can get the daily special, which was rice with eel and a side of Im not sure what, some kind of starch that seemed like a potato but wasnt a potato. . . . Anywhoo the portion is small but its quite yummy, the special also comes with your own little pot of tea that they come around and refill from time to time. I also opted for the add $3 to your bill for their desert of the day which happened to be mango pudding. So refreshing! Just what I needed after a rich tasting entree.
Bee C.}Brooklyn, NY}2}365}0}-1}5}12/31/2012}This place is just the loveliest!We went for the mochi, but got some appetizers and tea. It was a nice light snack. Everything tasted clean, fresh and just like it was supposed to.calamari terayaki: the sauce was really good, the calamari was tendersmoked salmon toast: there is a lot of toast, but the sauce and the salmon were excellentchrysanthemum tea: a bit lighter than I hoped, next time I would order something elseMochi: we got green tea, sesame, and chocolate. The Sesame was my favorite. The chocolate was a truffle with an outer layer of mochi wrapper.Yes, it is pricey, but it is worth it.
Maya M.}Manhattan, NY}64}39}4}-1}3}12/30/2012}I had one of there green teas and a dessert special, a Japanese agar dessert. It also included rice balls, green tea ice cream, and a sweet syrup. Overall not too impressed. But the place is really cute. I'd go back for their tea ceremony though. I'd like to experience that since I've never been to Japan. It may give me a taste of their culture!
Stephanie Y.}New York, NY}848}1210}25}18}4}12/29/2012}Cash only! Which is annoying because its not cheap!  3.5 star. Definitely an authentic, fun Japanese experience. They do serious tea here- there are many different kinds of tea to try, they have a bunch of cans of loose lea teas out front. But the drink to get it the matcha green the latte with red bean.  It a strong matcha flavor and is really thick and filling. It comes in a really nice Japanese tea bowl. Honestly I got a little sick after drinking it because it was so filling. Came with a girlfriend on Sat night and had to sit at the bar.  We shared the green tea roll cake which they make in house so you need to wait some 15 min. The cake itself was yummy and spongy, but the green tea cream was a bit too much. It comes with sake ice cream- very interesting; a sweet sake flavor but not so much that it's gross, with, more red bean and a waffle crisp. My gf ordered a homemade chocolate cookie which hard like biscotti- not a fan. She also said it wasn't chocolate enough. I'd also say that for the prices, while the food is gourmet, the service is not pristine as is the case for most japanese places. They were a little slow and asked us to move down seats at the bar for no apparent reason (as no one was lining up). Id recommend for the experience but beware of price. Everything came to $20 (one matcha, cookie and dessert)
Lana T.}Financial District, NY}329}284}110}18}4}12/18/2012}I came here because of the strong Yelp review.  I think I need to try again because I came here after eating pizza.Venue: (4/5) Feels like a japanese tea room.  I saw plenty of dates and small groups.  Service: (3/5) Service is average at best.  Food: (4/5) We ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brulee: its a must try Tea:  I'm not a huge tea person so I cannot rate this.  My friend loved her tea and said the selection was amazing.  Therefore I'll rank this a (5/5) for tea.Tip: Cash Only
Xuan S.}Brooklyn, NY}0}6}0}-1}4}12/16/2012}Food---I ordered the tea set and really enjoyed the Chai Dao DIY even more than the tea itself. Lol. The green tea ice-cream is fantastic. Service---Quite good, me and my friend is well served.Deco---small but cozy, nice for a catch-up between girlfriends or mind wandering by oneself.Price---Above the average but affordable. Recommend the lunch set. Worth a try.
Andrew J.}Manhattan, NY}204}143}401}-1}4}12/5/2012}This dessert/tea spot is pretty good - Wide selection of desserts, combination sets, teas, and appetizer style finger foods along with a cool atmosphere. The prices are a bit steep but as an establishment focused on desserts I guess you have to be?
Linh N.}Franklin Park, NJ}32}36}11}-1}4}12/4/2012}What's better than Japanese desserts? Cute and extremely tasty Japanese desserts that melt in your mouth the moment you savor it. Being a female Asian, I love to take pictures of my food, especially cute looking desserts, but the last time we were at Cha-An, my bf couldn't wait for me to arrange our dessert plates to take a nice picture and instagram it before uploading to fb. We normally choose a chef's dessert assortment  of 3-course dessert and pair it with the tea. Among the desserts we tried, I would recommend:- The black sesame creme brulee. I thought the combination was odd the first time I ordered it but it worked out very well. - The green tea cake- The green tea truffle- Vanilla (?) sweet tofu (it's not on the menu but once in awhile they will serve it if you order the chef's dessert assortment)Wasn't a fan of the ice cream, nothing extraordinary. Their cookies were a bit too dry for my liking. I like some of the tea I had, but I think "good tea" is more of a personal preference. :) I'd totally recommend this place. Bring cash tho.
Cheerie O.}New York, NY}9}51}138}-1}5}12/4/2012}The Black Sesame Creme Brulee is divine. A rich velvety explosion of toasted black sesame that melts in your mouth. They were out of the sake ice cream that goes on top, but it was still SO good! Also LOVE the black sesame cookie crisp that come with the creme brulee. I can probably eat 10 of these.The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce was good but nothing that blew me away.Green tea was good and strong. Waitress was super attentive in refilling it with hot water! Can't wait to come back :)
Josh Q.}San Francisco, CA}33}414}0}-1}4}11/29/2012}All of the green tea and black sesame-flavored desserts were amazing!  If only the accommodations were a little better... but I am just nitpicking.  In terms of pure dessert spots, this place has few equals.
Sony L.}Brooklyn, NY}5}50}2}-1}3}11/28/2012}Pretty pricey , small portions but great ice cream and atmosphere.  Fast service , Fast refills on tea. Yet again high prices compared to radiance uptown.More for dessert than for real food. the salmon sandwich lunch kit is $18 but it does not include tea and the portions are small
Ryan D.}San Francisco, CA}511}209}120}-1}3}11/27/2012}I came here and tried a few things. First, I was a little hungry so I had their ginger pork. It was good, flavorful and juicy along with onions, but the portions were miniscule for a $7 dish. I tried the sesame brulee which was good, especially the ice cream. I also tried the green tea mochi, which was alright but I wasn't a fan of the consistency of the mochi outside. The service was alright but it took a lot of effort to get attention to our table sometimes (which is odd considering it's tiny). We also had to wait a good deal of time, but that's just an effect of their popularity.I liked the food, my rating reflects more on the price of the dishes vs. the portions.
Coy B.}New York, NY}92}37}12}-1}3}11/18/2012}A recent discovery that specializes in small bites and Japanese Tea and Desserts (with more emphasis on the latter two). If you like the above, you can't go wrong here on a cool night.I'm not the biggest fan of just eating dessert, I'm more a savory and sour kind-of-guy.If I liked dessert more, I'd give it 4 stars and am sure it's what my wife would give to this quaint spot in the East Village.
Cindy L.}New York, NY}156}37}8}-1}5}11/16/2012}I love this place! I always come back with my friend who lives in the city and every time our friends from out of state visits, we always bring them here. It's a small, cute, cozy place that's great for a date or just catching up with people. I'm a huge tea person and have the biggest sweet tooth so I had to try it when I first found out about Cha-An.Everyone always raves about the sesame creme brulee and wow, can i talk about foodgasm? I may be exaggerating, but as a huge foodie, I thought it was the best creme brulee I ever had. It was delicious with a strong sesame flavor, but not too overpowering and sweet. Also, they topped it off with sesame ice cream, which is also delicious. The other good dish I had was the green tea roll with sake ice cream. I'm not a fan of sake so I was worried about the amount of sake in the ice cream, but I'm glad I ordered it. The green tea roll cake tasted great (can't go wrong with green tea flavor). The ice cream was light and refreshing with just a hint of "sake", which was perfect for me. As for the drinks, I don't remember what tea I ordered, but they all sound great. Be spontaneous and just choose any! It's hard to believe that any of them would taste bad. I also had the green tea matcha drink, which has red beans on the bottom. If you're not a fan of hot drinks, then definitely try the green tea matcha The only drawback is the it's NOT cheap. But hey, you pay for what you get =)
John L.}McLean, VA}6}8}2}-1}4}11/15/2012}On a recent trip to NYC, I made a stop into Cha-An. It's a great, small teahouse that serves both food and snacks/desserts. As I only got the desserts and tea, I will focus my review in that area. The desserts and tea were quite good, I made a second trip.The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. Dim lighting, not too many tables, cozy experience. They have a tea chamber where they have tea ceremonies 3-4 times a week, I think. Cha-An has a great selection of teas, from Chinese to Herbal to Japanese. They also have good tea treats and good (but not great) matcha ice cream. Their jasmine ice cream is better than the matcha, and they had a pretty unique black sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream.The -1 star goes to the rather expensive pricing for their items, and the overall quality of the food isn't awe-inspiring. But if you have some time and want to stop in to a nice place, have something to drink and eat while catching up with an old friend, this place is hard to beat.
Marcia W.}New York, NY}65}224}8}-1}5}11/13/2012}LOVE this place! I've only been here for dessert and it's definitely worth every dollar. However, I've been EXTREMELY disappointed that they no longer make their Green Tea Roll Cake :(Recommended:- Freshly Baked Scones- Matcha Latte- Chocolate Mochi
Chris K.}Washington, DC}46}379}65}-1}4}11/1/2012}What a wonderful experience! After living in the East Village for over a year, I finally ate at Cha-An with my dearest rat friend. We came here for lunch, and had a glorious time! The setting is cute - Asian themed but not zen kitschy. I got the afternoon tea set, which came with green tea (standard) and salmon tartar bowl. The salmon tartar tasted fresh and worked really well with the other accompaniments (rice, nori, pickled veggies). My friend got their other lunch set and had a nice soymilk quiche (I normally hate quiche - but loved the lightness of this one) and a few other small dishes (the eggplant she got was divine~)We shared our desserts. We were both enraptured by the jiggle jiggle of the mango pudding (very light and fruity) and we also enjoyed the tofu cheesecake (creamy but a lot lighter than regular cheesecake.)
Rad B.}Dayton, NJ}77}214}9}-1}5}10/27/2012}Awesome awesome awesome! Another dessert place had a super long line so we went here. The service is incredibly warm and friendly. I had some jasmine tea with the black sesame creme brûlée. Oh my god. To keep this PG I will say it was a taste explosion in my mouth. The brûlée was the best I've had...the sesame makes it so awesome! The ice cream was yummy too and the little sesame brittle was awesome! Bottom line: I have to come back here!! Great service and awesome dessert. Nom!
Ariel D.}Long Beach, CA}1}20}0}-1}3}10/27/2012}The "entree" food here isn't too good, considering how expensive it is, and the fact that this place is a tea house.The desserts, however, are much better. The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce was amazing. The souffle was incredibly rich and chocolatey. It might just be me, but chocolate flavored things usually don't taste chocolatey, or it takes a minute for the chocolate flavor to arrive. But not this souffle--it was SO instantaneously and incredibly chocolatey, like, L.A. Burdick's Hot Chocolate chocolatey. (For those who don't know, that's pretty fucking chocolatey.) And with the raspberry sauce to play off the chocolate, it was the perfect compliment of light and tangy to rich and indulgent.The jasmine ice cream is probably the best thing here, though. I've come back just for this ice cream. It tastes exactly how you think it should and would taste. The jasmine flavor is strong, sweet, and aromatic. I was so good. I ordered it twice in one sitting. (Note: 1 order of ice cream comes with 2 scoops. You can get 2 different flavors this way, but honestly, just get 2 scoops of jasmine. Also, don't judge me.)It sucks that this place is cash only, considering how pricey it is for such small portions.
Lu H.}Queens, NY}1209}407}1855}-1}3}10/22/2012}Super cute and cozy atmosphere. I enjoy coming here post-dinner to relax and chat over tea.  What is not enjoyable is the fact that sound is not absorbed very well and its always full so that all the simultaneous conversations make this place a lot louder than expected for a seemingly tranquil decor.  Another reason why I'm not rating the place higher is the desserts -- consistently disappointing.The black sesame creme brulee is what drew me here in the first place.  I think the black sesame tofu dessert at Kyotofu is much, much better.  Sesame is an intense flavor and can be very filling.  This dessert actually made me feel sick after.  The ice cream on top of the creme brulee didn't do much for it either.  I can't remember the other desserts I've gotten here, but nothing that really makes me want to come back.  The food is also very expensive for what it is -- rice porridge with picked veggies and side dishes.  I would come back here for the tea.
Michael L.}KNICKERBOCKER, NY}0}98}1}-1}5}10/20/2012}i love absolutely everything from cha-an: the creme brule, the cookies, the tea, the cha-an sets, the tea sets, everything is incredibly well thought and elegant. the place itself is perfect for a romantic night out, for catching up with friends, any occasion really.
Anna Y.}New York, NY}3}25}0}-1}5}10/20/2012}I really like this place!You can come with friends and enjoy a cup of tea or try a dessert. Or you can come for dinner and enjoy a delicious meal that feels like it's been cooked at home and prepared just for you! (not the porridge set though) Don't forget to order a tea!I really enjoyed the salad with with smoked salmon, the pork belly dish, and the other little dishes that come with the dinner set. They usually switch up the dishes in the dinner set since they have been different each time I go.
Joyce X.}Queens, NY}3}33}24}-1}5}10/19/2012}I went there to have lunch with my girls..I still remember that sounds like something just happened..Really nice food there but they made it very dainty, which caused me to refuse to eat it..
Ann N.}Houston, TX}40}29}349}-1}5}10/17/2012}Perfect place for catching up with an old friend or significant other who shares a love for sweets and tea time.  We went for a late afternoon snack that was rather pleasant on a chilly day.Ebi Chili Don and Genmaicha $13- Late afternoon Tuesday lunch special. Comes with a pot of Genmaicha Green Tea that was constantly refilled. They weren't quite prawns but rather regular shrimps over what I'm assuming is sticky rice. Comes with 2 small sides to play with the palate - something sweet and something sour. Dish was good and satisfying.Pork Belly - Appetizer special.  Tender and good. But I wouldn't say I'd go back for more. Black Sesame Creme Brûlée - delicious. Perfect and not too sweet.Green Tea Icecream - one of the best that I've had!Jasmine Icecream - first time trying it and I loved it! Perfect for the tea lover.I can see this place being a regular visit.
Jo K.}New York, NY}267}494}313}18}4}10/16/2012}I came here 5 years ago on a date and really liked this place and have come back frequently after. Great tea selection, quiet and quaint and very Japanese. The desserts are delicious. I only had the food once and it was years ago so I can't really remember, but for me this is a place that I come to after a meal to sit and chit chat with my friends so I'm never hungry when I get here. There usually is a wait, but it's not too bad.
Sophie T.}Brooklyn, NY}6}13}5}-1}5}10/15/2012}Afternoon tea set for $18,warm fresh bread and buttery scones! Very friendly staff and a place to hang out with friends and even alone.
Eva L.}Jersey City, NJ}72}92}4}-1}5}9/30/2012}OMG is there a need for me to comment on this place? IT'S JUST GREAT FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES.I haven't had anything that is not good yet. The desserts here not only taste great, but look like an art piece as well.This place is located on the 2nd floor. Kinda hard to find. There is limited number of tables. If you happen to come with a big group, you might end up waiting for a long time. But the good thing is you can leave your number with the hostess. She will call you when there's seat available :) How considerate!
Shaypup S.}Manhattan, NY}1}16}0}-1}3}9/28/2012}came here for lunch and really enjoyed both savory items and dessert.  the presentation was very pretty and food was delicious.  space is cozy and mellow.
Erin C.}New York, NY}178}120}123}18}5}9/25/2012}Salmon tartar don lunch special is delicious!!Every time I'm in New York city, I will go here for a late night dessert and tea or for lunch or dinner. I wish there was a Cha-An in SF as it would probably be one of my last meals on earth. sigh.Cha-An has a cozy intimate ambiance and the food is fresh and always delicious. It's also very reasonably priced! (bonus points) Scones are made-to-order and are amazinggg. All the desserts are amazing. Black Sesame Creme Brulee (who would've thought?) AMAZING. I love the variety of tea choices they have as well.If you are a New Yorker or visitor, go try it. You will thank me.Yours Truly
Shireen L.}Manhattan, NY}233}64}0}-1}5}9/24/2012}This review is long overdue. I've been visiting this establishment since '09 so Cha-an has a special place in my heart. :)Definitely a good place to come with 2-3 friends to just chill, hang out, gossip, or have a long and fulfilling talk about philosophy...whatever you do, you will be treated with utmost respect by the nice waiters who will only stop and interrupt every so often to ask if you want your tea to be refilled. The meal sets are sort of overpriced but definitely very good and healthy for you. The main showstealers for this place are the desserts! Please try:1. Chocolate Souffle: definitely good value and comparable to dessert at any top notch restaurant.2. Flower Craft Tea; not to strong and it always makes me giddy to watch the flower bloom!3. Scones: are amazing and come with complimentary raspberry jam and cream.Definitely a place to try out!
Julie S.}Manhattan, NY}7}190}198}-1}4}9/21/2012}My friend and I went solely for dessert and tea. We were in the neighborhood for dinner and wanted amazing dessert. The wait was long. the place is very tiny. But it has a beautiful Japanese feel to it. We both had the black sesame creme brulee. The presentation was beautiful. The curled sesame tuile on top was yummy. The small scoop of sesame ice cream placed on top. It was perfect and the right amount. It is very rich and creamy but not too much of heavy cream that you might think of when you have an original creme brulee. There is a large selection of tea. Which was great. I had the Yinzhen silver needle white tea. It was light and buttery sweet. My friend had the herbal chamomile tea. I will definitely be back again and it will be a place I'd take friends and family from out of town to. Also the waitresses are soo pleasant and polite. Cons: cash only, can be a long wait
Elizabeth M.}Brooklyn, NY}11}280}161}-1}4}9/21/2012}BLACK SESAME CREME BRULEE! GREEN TEA ROLL!! Just a few bites into each dessert my boyfriend firmly stated "we're coming back here next week."Some people stated that the desserts are a bit pricey but I think $8-9 is quite a good deal for such delicious and expertly made desserts. It just sucks that Cha An is cash only! My boyfriend and I wanted to order more but we didn't have enough cash on us.Choosing dessert was the easy part. Choosing a tea is hard! There are soo many options and for a noob like me, it was overwhelming. Thankfully, their thick menu also contains brief descriptions on each tea. I went the safe route and picked a familiar green tea/rice blend from Japan for $5 (FREE HOT WATER REFILLS!) that tasted a lot like Korean rice tea. I'll have to be more adventurous next time.Minus one star for the atmosphere... I was expecting a quiet and serene environment but that was not the case. Perhaps it was due to the time of day (7:30pm on Friday).... but the loud patrons dampened my experience here.PS - they have a bidet! But I was scared to use it. What if I pressed the wrong button and water shot up everywhere?! How could I walk back to my table in wet clothes??
Nelly N.}Manhattan, NY}7}189}67}-1}5}9/21/2012}The tea selection here was insane!  Too many teas to pick from, it was really overwhelming.  I felt bad, it was so busy and I had a crazy amount of questions.  I finally settled on some roasted green tea, oh so exquisite.  It was so good, but I bet if it was an iced tea it would be even better.
Joan W.}Elmhurst, NY}38}51}20}-1}4}9/17/2012}Good desserts! Located on the 2nd floor, it feels like we had stepped into Japan when we entered. Lovely decor. Great place to hang out with a friend or two.
Cynthia L.}Washington, DC}241}759}487}18}5}9/10/2012}For dessert only:-Black sesame creme brulee w/ black sesame ice cream - Absolutely to die for...someone tell me how I make this at home!-Chocolate souffle w/ raspberry sauce-Scarlet Glow Herbal Tea (a little too tangy for my taste...if you like passion fruit tea you'll like this)-Remaining desserts: We honestly ordered a smorgousbord of desserts so I cannot remember the rest, only that their ice creams are worth trying.-Small, quiet & intimate little place-Friendly staff-Using a fully automated bidet was quite an interesting experience
Victor W.}New York, NY}686}121}36}-1}5}9/10/2012}Bamboo houses, mouth-watering desserts, high tech toliets, What not to like?
Lucy L.}New York, NY}9}21}3}-1}4}9/9/2012}a bit overpriced, but you are paying for the ambience! beautiful decor.Cool story: I took shots of sake with a Pastor's wife here. I love tea thus I love Cha-An.
Grace W.}Manhattan, NY}6}18}0}-1}3}9/9/2012}Very nice Japanese dessert place except for being over-priced a little bit. Their desserts are not traditional Japanese dessert, but being creative, authentic, pretty and relatively healthy. Plus, the room decorations and service are totally Japanese. Girls love it. The price is definitely higher than what they actually deserve. But I believe the restaurant's strategy is to position itself as the high-quality, small-scale Japanese teahouse. So, pricing higher is a part of strategy. As customer, I will not go often, but would go whenever I want to taste Japanese desserts as well as the Japanese service.
Kay C.}New York, NY}2}56}2}-1}4}9/7/2012}must try smoked salmon toast. too little salmon tho. It is not worth the price. however, it is really tasty. Your tough is gonna fall in love with it. my favorite among the whole menu.
cy c.}ASTORIA, NY}80}133}0}-1}4}9/1/2012}I'm picky about dessert, but this place is good. everything is what it's supposed to be(although this sounds easy and basic, in fact it's not as common as it seems) not super fancy or adventurous, but very authentic and delicate.
Ada C.}Brooklyn, NY}13}23}8}-1}3}9/1/2012}Initially, I thought this place was a "great find" - After going a few more times, the realization is that the (dessert & tea) menu selection are somewhat limited.  Nonetheless, the ambiance & service are decent.
Wei V.}Jersey City, NJ}198}509}2649}18}5}8/31/2012}This place is AWESOME! I had been there at least 5 times already. I remember that I was there for 2 weekends in a row. I just couldn't stop going there and I knew there were many awesome places in the east village. When I was at this place, I felt very calm and relaxed.Food and desserts were perfect for having with the tea selections that they had. Or you can just go there to enjoy a pot of tea, which I have done twice already after having dinner. I loved how they refilled hot water. The tea was so good and had a lot of flavor. Each hot tea came with different teapot, which was very cool.Do plan ahead to go to this place. It could be very crowded and you might need to wait for a while. Service is on the slower side but it's worth it.. :)
Lucy C.}New York, NY}131}1173}43}18}5}8/25/2012}Cha An Tea House is the perfect place to relax, enjoy quality tea, get amazing japanese food, and melt in its rich desserts. If you find this small place on 9th street, climb the staircase to heaven, this cute, authentic Japanese tea house. It's small, zen, and fits a surprisingly large amount of people. There is a secluded room for larger parties and many small tables. While it gets crowded, its peaceful. The ambiance is great.I had unagi hitsumabishi don, which is the eal and tomago (sweet egg) rice dish, for $13. The tomago was the softest I've ever had, which was a great ontrast to the flavorful eel pieces and sticky japanese rice. The side dish it came with were pickled vegetables and seaweed-mushroom-lima bean salad. Honestly, I could eat that salad for the rest of my life. It is so refreshing. And how they packed so much flavor in a couple bites of salad is crazy. I also had the 6 small appetizers for $13. I enjoyed the sashimi, which was so soft and fresh. Also enjoyed the beef and the squid. Didn't much care for the other vegetables though. My friend and I ordered the Chiran Sencha tea. I usually don't drink much tea but I had a couple cups of this one. I'm sure all the tea here is amazing. I also noticed every type of tea gets completely different pots, cups, and paraphernalia.It's also unlimited refills; they just keep adding hot water to your tea pot until you leave. Last but not least, I had to get the black sesame creme brulee, for $8. Holy. F*ck. Reviews before mine did not lie. This treat is a work of culinary art. The black sesame cracker on top was so crispy. The black sesame and vanilla ice cream swirl on top was so creamy, subtle, and frankly, beautiful. The creme brulee part was to die for. Two inches of rich black sesame creme was so soft, rich, and torched to perfection. It melted in my mouth and I literally shuddered from how insanely good it was. All I said was "insanity, this is insanity".You can't die without coming to Cha An first. While it's not cheap, trust me, you won't regret it. The place is so nice (even the bathrooms come with the special butt-cleaning japanese toilets). My only complaints are that there's a tight squeeze between tables, the chopsticks were weird (I was afraid of getting splinter from mine), and that this place is cash only. But obviously it was worth it, if I'm giving it a 5-star rating. I'm definitely coming back here again. I need to try everyone on the menu.
Celia Z.}New York, NY}245}307}747}-1}3}8/25/2012}I'm actually quite disappointed over the hype of Cha-An.  Several times I have returned here, mostly from the pleads of friends who want to fill up on desserts as a prelude to drinks afterwards.  Though the place does not take reservations, the wait is bearable, with 20 minutes at the most, and service is fast and friendly; the desserts, creative.There are not many places in town that serve three course desserts, nor do many restaurants match Cha-An in its plating.  A small, tranquil atmosphere with its wooden floors and petite seats, Cha-An is a great place to catch up with friends and relax after a tough week at work.  Yet within our chill conversation comes the too-sweet macarons that engulf the creamy, nutty, natural flavors; the mochi that lacks in skin-to-filling ratio; the ice-cream, which tries to cover in sweetness what it misses in richness.  With courses small and prices expensive (with the silly requirement that everyone at the table must order one dish), Cha-An is a disappointment at best.  It's worth going once, at least for the aesthetics and atmosphere, but it's the second and third time around that you begin to wonder about the opportunity cost of money spent and calories wasted.
Lorraine C.}New York, NY}317}118}109}-1}5}8/23/2012}I really like the atmosphere of this little place. Try the salmon toast! I had the afternoon tea set and came with small portions of some desserts and two mini bagel sandwiches , all tasted very delicious. I tried the chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and black sesame creme brulee. The souffle was a bit too sweet and might get too sickly sweet to finish. Will definitely visit this place again soon !! & I love their restroom !! :)
Jungmin L.}Boston, MA}0}255}0}-1}4}8/21/2012}I thought I walked into a tea room in Tokyo. Incredibly soothing - dark wooden interior with lots of intimate space. Service is impeccable. The green tea products (both matcha in drinking and dessert form) are amazing. Incredibly smooth, no bitterness but deep green tea flavor. Red bean paste is also perfectly cooked and sweetened.Black sesame ice cream was a disappointment though. Compared to those I've had in Korea and Japan, I thought it was too sweet and did not have distinguished black sesame flavor. Just felt like small black sesame streaks in vanilla ice cream.
J. N.}Los Angeles, CA}150}67}20}-1}5}8/19/2012}I am a tea and mochi lover, and this place was perfect! It's quaint, cozy, romantic, modern, and the list goes on. One of my most memorable places to eat.
Terry N.}San Jose, CA}327}270}253}-1}5}8/17/2012}This tiny place is mostly known as being a tea house that serves desserts as well. But my recommendation is to try their set dinners. Selection is very limited (I think there's like one offering a night). But you get a nice variety of homestyle, Japanese comfort food. Crafted with love, the food seemed like it could have been made for me by my grandma... if my grandma were Japanese.
Jane L.}New York, NY}21}148}30}-1}4}8/16/2012Updatedreview}Cute place. Ordered chef's prix fixe and green tea cheesecake with sake icecream. The green tea cheesecake with sake icecream was pretty damn good. There was a slight bitter flavor to the cheesecake from the green tea which I liked. I was skeptical about the sake icecream at first but changed my mind once I tasted it. It works for some reason. As for the prix fixe, it came with first course, black sesame icecream, which is basically vanilla icecream mixed with black sesame. The black sesame flavoring was not as strong as how I had it last time but still as good. Second course was the mango pudding with whipcream on top and and grapefruit whoopie pie.  Mango pudding blew my mind. Grapefruit whoopie pie was also delicious. It's awesome how much flavor they can compact into both desserts. Finished off the prix fixe with scrumptious sesame short bread cookies and a macaron. Macaron tasted interesting, not the usual macarons that I usually have. It's delicious nonetheless. I love this place :)
Jenny S.}Pasadena, CA}2064}2481}6739}18}3}8/16/2012}i'm a dessert lover but this place didn't fulfill my cravings! perhaps because asian desserts are usually more mild & I was craving rich/sweet desserts at the time PLUS portions are small---Black sesame creme brûlée: good! my favorite of what we ordered---Matcha tea drink: not very sweet, you can really taste the whole milk---chocolate souffle: light, not too chocolatey---strawberry dessert of the day: eHhhhcute japanese atmosphere BUT PRICEY for the small portions!
Babiie J.}Brooklyn, NY}5}10}18}-1}5}8/14/2012}I love this place!! from every visit to this place, they always surprise me with new tasty desserts that I've never seen before. I love their flan and the black sesame cream brûlée I had last time I went there. Also, the waitresses were all so friendly~ love this place! Should give this place a try if you are around there!~=)
Stephen Y.}New York, NY}13}32}1}-1}4}8/14/2012}The wide-ranging selection of teas is complemented nicely by a lovely bathroom, making the experience of enjoying that selection all the more convenient. There is a really lovely atmosphere here - intimate, serene and Japanese - which is only complemented by the waitstaff's command of English and confusing menu structures. The tea room is also useful for those random, spur-of-the-moment tea ceremonies and fortunately rarely gets booked out. It could double as a martial arts movie set if the camera were not able to pan more than 5.7 feet.No menu substitutions but do tell them if you have a food allergy. While I'm lactose intolerant, I did not inform them of this but as mentioned above they have a lovely bathroom.
Yura L.}Manhattan, NY}146}11}1}-1}4}8/13/2012}Love this place! Tiny room filled with cuteness, interesting food choices, and fantastic tea presented in traditional Japanese tea ceremony way.
Alexandra B.}Scottsdale, AZ}16}19}5}-1}5}8/4/2012}My friends and I dropped by the tea house after lurking around China Town and eating a dozen or so soup dumplings at Joe's, looking for something light and dessert-ish. The atmosphere inside the tea house was very nice. You walk up a small flight of stairs and you're in a small, cozy room decorated with Asian designs and wooden tables and chairs. I ordered "honey phoenix" tea, and an icecream dish with black sesame and fruit icecream. That was my first time ever having black sesame icecream, and I really, really liked the taste. I also had a taste of my friend's scone, which they heated for him. Overall, we had a good time here and we liked all of the desserts and tea.
Jane A.}New York, NY}16}176}157}-1}5}8/2/2012}Extremely authentic and cute. I have been looking for an experience like this since I went to Japan and this is the first time that I've actually found it. The creme brule is very much a fusion of the French idea with Japanese flavors/style. It is expensive so keep in mind that it is a special treat. Anyway it would cost the same or more in Japan and you don't have to pay for a plane ticket!
Jeremy G.}Los Angeles, CA}14}34}0}-1}5}7/21/2012}Yes, it's expensive. These types of places are expensive in Tokyo - and they're only likely to be *more* expensive in New York. If you're expecting "value" in some undefined way, then don't come here.It's probably 4.5 stars, as I've been to places like this in Tokyo that I prefer. That said, it's the best tea house I think I've encountered in either LA or NY. Great little desserts, pretty high quality real matcha, a nice atmosphere, etc. If you've spent time in Japan or like these types of shops, I highly recommend stopping here.I'd recommend the matcha - but yes, matcha is really that expensive. If you buy it and prepare it yourself (which I highly recommend - try ordering from yuuki-cha or ippodo in Japan), it can *still* be pretty expensive. This is a bit of a tangent, but all the matcha I've bought in the US is - to use the technical term for it - awful. Both Ippodo and Yuuki-Cha are amazing - although my personal tastes run more toward Yuuki-Cha. They both have significant English language websites and also sell all the required implements to brew matcha. And you really need those implements - it's not just for show.Anyways - go to Cha-An if you want to try real matcha. Some of the only good matcha I've tasted in the US.
Priyanka M.}New York, NY}140}126}3}-1}5}7/17/2012}Really great place for tea and desserts! Tends to be crowded but, if you're adventurous, I'd recommend going for some awesome sweets and yummy tea. The staff is very polite. They might rush you a bit but stand your ground and you'll be in for a pleasant time!
Jason C.}Rockville, MD}333}493}671}18}5}7/16/2012}"Cha-An": "Cha"=Tea and "An"=house.   The words refer to a tea house that serves as an annex to the main household in feudal japan.  The ambiance of Cha-An is quite breathtaking.  The dimly lit area has not been modernized to levels that remind one of the Anglo-Asian fusion decor that populates some of the hipster scenes in the Big Apple.  The touch of modern aesthetics with a dominating Japanese style of decor provides just the perfect mix that brings familiarity with an "edge".In particular, the Asiatic ambiance is enhanced by the presence of the tea room.  The team room is a replica of rooms found in tea houses in feudal Japan where groups/friends/families will partake in afternoon tea ceremonies.  For some options, Cha-An provides this service at an affordable cost (hefty if you decide to rent the entire room) of $15 for a 30 minutes session on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of the month.  For the regular customers, Cha-An serves an eclectic mix of food, dessert, tea, and coffee, some of which are Western fusion based items and some of which are traditional.Some of the common items that I see people eat here are toasts (salmon, red bean toasts), pound cake, tea, coffee, and ice cream.The most noteworthy item that I have tried at Cha-An was a Black sesame CREME BRULEE.  It has a custard base ingrained with black sesame that was grounded and mixed in with the custard.  To give an analogy, the black sesame is to creme brulee as oreos is to cookie and cream ice cream:  the small bits and pieces of the black sesame create a slightly rocky texture with flavors of black sesame that is well dispersed throughout the custard.  If I were to state one negative, I felt that the black sesame was too coarse and should have been more finely ground.  Because of this, the caramelized top portion had a slightly burnt taste.  In sum, while the desserts and food choices leave some desire for improvement, Cha-An provides a unique experience and stunning Japanese decor that one cannot find in the US at a reasonable price point. 4* for the food/dessert/tea + 5* for ambience (at this price point) = 4.5* average
Shing Yiing O.}Manhattan, NY}380}622}603}-1}4}7/12/2012}Decided to check out Cha-An after dinner for dessert.. since they receive such a high rating on Yelp.. When I walked up to their restaurant.. they told the party in front of us to wait for 20 minutes.. But they had a table for 2!! I AM LUCKY!!!looking at their menu.. I ordered the chef dessert(something like that).. with 5 dollars additional for tea.. I don't know how they match it though.. but here is what I had.. (I just like surprises)Ice-cream: black sesame ice-cream.. My friend dislike black sesame said that it's good.. I AGREE!!! The flavor is so rich with just a small bite.. I just wanna ask for more..2nd course: Some hazelnut mousse dessert and tofu?? (I am sorry I am really bad with names).. Both were DELICIOUS!!! I am amazed by how japanese design their dessert and had a twist on it.. I am not a big fan of mousse type of dessert.. but hazelnut reminds me of Nutella.. which I love it.. the "tofu" is a little sweet and soft.. just like chinese "tofu fa"final course.. I guess is raspberry macaroon and some japanese cracker.. Raspberry macaroon is a little too sweet.. Is not a big deal as I can get it from other places as well.. As for the cracker.. I guess there is some peanuts and some sugar in it.. I remembered the "taste" as I had this type of cracker in Japan before..Tea is not a big deal for me as I might get cheaper tea leafs outside.. My friend ordered the Ice Macha.. If you like starbucks green tea frappucino/latte.. yes.. you will love this.. or even if you don't like it.. you will like this too.. because I LOVE IT.. and I DISLIKE GREEN TEA drinks at starbucks besides the tazo green tea..Sorry I have to give only 4 stars because I prefer Kyotofu.. but Cha-An is different in a way.. they have other stuff for you to check out.. tea-ceremony, their home-made french toast.. I might return to Cha-An because of their environment and their options on their menu.. The environment will make you feel like you are in Japan.
Jan Z.}San Francisco, CA}129}316}0}18}5}7/10/2012}This tearoom is worth the wait (it was a 30-minute+ wait)! It is quite the refuge from the bustling streets below and has a delightful selection of fragrant teas. The seasonal dessert with cold matcha, sake ice cream, etc. was the perfect cool-down, and the lavender-mint tea completely refreshed the senses. Next time, I look forward to trying the jasmine green or the chrysanthemum.
Jasmine L.}New York, NY}123}30}4}-1}2}7/9/2012}I had high hopes for this place. I mean, come on: over 530 reviews with 4 1/2 stars. I expected to be WOW-ed. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.I really liked the interior and spent most of my time just staring at the gourd in the center of the room (what is that thing?). The server was friendly and I enjoyed my cup of tea. However, the desserts were overpriced for what they were. The chocolate soufflé with raspberry compote was sunken in and tasted like something from Betty Crocker. The sesame crème brûlée was okay. I like the sesame crisp on top and that was it.If I were to come here again (most likely not), I would forego the desserts and just enjoy the teas.
Cecilia Z.}Los Angeles, CA}766}644}43}-1}4}7/8/2012}Cha-An is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of NYC. Stepping inside this tea house on the second floor of a discreet storefront, you truly feel like you have been transported to an entirely different world - somewhere in Kyoto, perhaps.While I've sang praises about the wide tea selection and serene ambiance of this place before, I can now say that Cha-An also does desserts very well. The black sesame creme brûlée is every bit as amazing as everyone makes it out to be - luscious, nutty and surprisingly well balanced in terms of texture and sweetness. The custard itself wasn't too sweet which I appreciated, and the lightly flavored black sesame ice cream went perfectly with it. I really enjoyed the sweet, brittle-like black sesame crisp dressed on top as well. Black on black on black, what do you know about that! Their dessert special that the bf ordered, a strawberry layered pie, was very composed and great as well. It was the perfect summer dessert, light and fruity with fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream.The only downside about this place is that some of the food items and drinks can get quite pricey. But I really can't think of a more relaxing place to spend a hot summer afternoon in good company, so I think it's worth it. Relax in class!
Ziyan C.}San Francisco, CA}83}1865}8356}18}4}7/7/2012}A nice, hidden understated spot. If you come with just one buddy, you can sit at the tea bar (if there's space) without waiting for a table.* Black sesame creme brulee - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/5QgB…(with black sesame ice cream)This could easily have been black sesame overkill, as the creme brulee was topped with a black sesame crisp AND black sesame ice cream. But somehow they avoided overkill as all the flavors and textures were slightly different, enough to complement each other. Any single one of these elements would have been really underwhelming by itself, especially the creme brulee (I would say its texture was a little too soft for my preference. I like it a little more firm. Also it was served at room temperature - I'm not sure what's proper for creme brulee, but I like it cold with a freshly flamed crisp top layer). But put all three together and they just go together really well as a dessert.
Diane Y.}New York, NY}183}7}1}-1}5}7/6/2012}After walking up the stairs into Cha-An you instantly leave New York City and you end up in a Japanese Tea House. Cha-An is a haven away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. I came on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait. It is a small place so I would expect it to be crowded during busier times such as weekends. The first thing I noticed was their adorable menu; it was a mini cloth covered binder. Cha-An serves a variety type of teas, desserts and a small variety of Japanese food. The food is unique and more rooted with culture than a regular Japanese resturant. Cha-An is a Japanese Tea House. I only had tea and dessert but by the end of my experience I was very pleased. For the tea I had one of my favorite types of tea, Jasmine Pearls, a green tea flavored with jasmine flowers. My friend had the Flower Craft, it came in a beautiful clear tea pot. The Jasmine Pearls was delightful; it was flowery and delicate and the aroma was superb.For dessert I enjoyed the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. This dessert was simply amazing. The Asian spin on the creme brulee was well played. The custard was topped off with a torched sugar top like a traditional creme brulee, on top of that sat a scoop of black sesame ice cream and a black sesame cookie. I also enjoyed this dessert a lot because it was just the right amount of sweet, I don't like eating things that are too sweet. The Black Sesame Creme Brulee was delicately sweet and nutty. The Black Sesame Creme Brulee is a must try!Over all my experience at Cha-An was great. I would love to visit again and try other items on their menu. The ambiance was very calming and enchanting for me. Cha-An would be an amazing date spot!
Paris F.}New York, NY}11}306}186}-1}5}7/5/2012}My favorite cafe where I find my delicatessen dessert or lunch menu.  Very organic old traditional "inaka" japanese food like, it truly brings me a zen.  I have been coming here since the opening, and I usually come by myself for it is one place i can breath.   I was there last week of june, 2012,  i think the tea selection has downsized since the beginning but i am still in love with this place.  I am amazed that after all these years, the food (including dessert)  and drink quality has not gone down at all.The main reason why I come back here is the dessert is never super sweet like American sugar level, it is delicate and sweet enough.Update: dec. 2014The tea selection has went down but still an amazing lunch and the dessert!  Still my favorite!
teatzar s.}Altadena, CA}2}121}33}-1}5}7/2/2012}Excellent excellent excellent!!! We come here whenever we're in town. We don't find places like this in SF. The black sesame mochi rocks!
Kat C.}Brooklyn, NY}200}124}67}-1}5}6/28/2012}highlights: great decor, great food. many selections. peaceful ambiance matched the rainy weather outside. low lights: cramped quarters for slim people. confusing bathroom lock.tip: make sure to schedule a few extra minutes to peruse the menu ... it's literally the size of a book.
Leila Y.}Woodside, NY}9}173}101}-1}4}6/24/2012}The place is so cute! It looks like Japan inside. But they have all these rules like they only accept cash. I think they should put a sign on their door, so people will know. In addition, each person needs to order something from the menu. We wanted to share the Chef Selection but we couldnt because everybody had to order something. My bf ordered the Matcha float. It came with a dab of red bean on top of the matcha green tea drink and some foam. We also ordered the green tea roll and the chef special of the strawberry cream tart. The green tea roll had a strong green tea favoring. The strawberry cream tart was so good!!! The mix of the cream, fresh strawberries, and fresh tart was so yummy!!! I ate every last bit of it. I would definitely go back and eat that again.
Awula Y.}New York, NY}1}20}0}-1}5}6/20/2012}This place has a great feel to it. It is peaceful (depending on the time, because there is a club next to it and the bass is strong), and very Japanese. I haven't had dessert there since I came near closing hours but I had tea instead. Their tea has a nice aroma and taste. I ordered the Uji sencha (I can't recall), its light and smell wonderfully. Their tea cups and pots are gorgeous. I came with a group of 4 and all of us had different cute teapots.I highly recommend, but don't go near closing hours.
Jeanny C.}Philadelphia, PA}262}98}458}-1}5}6/17/2012}LOVED this tea house!! Felt like I was in Japan again!!I am not a big alcoholic drinker, but definitely a fanatic tea drinker! For all those out there like me, please come try this place at least once. There are many different types of tea available, including pages of explanation of how each types are different in its process of drying to all of its health benefits. I was completely full after dinner, but I had to try their green tea mochi. MELTS in your mouth! So delicious! I also tried their chocolate mochi and their special of the day sweet bean, they were really sweet (which isn't something I am into), but their green tea was just perfect for me.I also got a box of macaroons to go. delicious as well (although I have never really tasted a macaroon that wasn't delicious, so hard to say come to think of it) enjoyed it regardless.They also perform the Japanese Tea Ceremony on the 1st and 3rd sunday of the month which you have to reserve. When I went to Japan, I didn't get a chance to watch or enjoy one, so I definitely would like to try this someday. I enjoyed the Chinese Tea Ceremony a lot when I was in China.This is another one of my MUST TRY places. Bring someone who actually enjoys tea, or else it might be a bit boring for them. Definitely not a rowdy bar.
Jason C.}Queens, NY}16}411}37}-1}4}6/11/2012}Great place but they might need to make it a bit more customer friendly. A couple of offsetting rules of this place were: cash only, every person in the party must order from the menu. You'll feel rushed when they are packed.the desserts here are really good. if you were expecting non-Asian style desserts and flavors you were obviously in the wrong place. offering of red bean, matcha green tea, and taro are mixed into the offerings.We ordered matcha floats, green tea roll, and chef special strawberry cream tart. All three were nicely plated and packed with sweet goodness. the matcha float is an acquired taste but for green tea connoisseur you will enjoy this concoction of green tea over ice that is sweetened by red bean paste that adds subtle sweetness and bubble tea like texture. the green tea roll is lined with red bean and cream filling. Served with a sake ice cream and sesame brittle roll. spots of red bean paste complete the plate and add texture.the strawberry tart special was done well but did not stand out in my mind.
Evelyn S.}New York, NY}17}349}182}-1}5}6/11/2012}My favorite tea house in the city. It's gotten more popular over the years and rightly so but I miss just showing up and getting seated without a wait.The food is also delicious and they're very generous with refilling the hot water for the tea.The tea selection is varied and broken up into the different types. It's not the hugest menu but that would just be way too overwhelming. As with everything here, it's just right.Recommendations - the black sesame creme brulee never fails to please as well as the Cha-An toast with raspberry OR red bean. Excellent.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}4}6/6/2012}Famous for its desserts, this place also serves up some comforting japanese food.  Some of the sets they have though do have components which I dont really care for.  I kind of wish their food menu had more a la carte options.  All of the desserts looked amazing, but we were too full from eating the set dinners so we decided to save a true dessert tasting for next time.  The set dinner that we ordered also included a desert.  Almost reminds me of a kaiseki, except you pretty much get all of your food at once, but it has the rice component, fish, veggies, dessert, just missing the soup.  The food was decent, but of course fell short of my high expectations based on other reviews. The workers are pretty much all japanese which lets you know the authenticity of the joint.  I almost forgot to mention that they are also mainly famous for their teas, which they have many different varieties, all brewed with high attention to detail.  Both of the teas we sampled were good.Probability of a return visit: 99.9%
Wendy G.}Minato, Japan}238}721}1145}18}3}5/30/2012}3.5 starTrue, the dessert menu is of great variety, but beware the actual appetizer and food menu is very limited.Food have great presentation, but they just taste so heavy - actual texture very westernized, which just ruins the Japanese delicacy.  The place is also small and noisy - could be classier.All those midtown east Japanese niche places deliver more authentic experience at cheaper price. I would love to give Cha-an a four star, but I can't-- cuz i'm not a fan and most likely won't come back.
Richard S.}Los Angeles, CA}26}78}0}-1}5}5/29/2012}The mochi gave me a foodgasm. Everything here is amazing, totally worth it. Cash only, so be prepared. Also very small so kinda sucks for big groups but it's really relaxing.
Richard W.}Miami, FL}426}179}476}-1}4}5/29/2012}This little tea house took me by surprise. I tried their 6 little appetizer and Sunday lunch special. Was amazed how great the food is. Didn't tried their dessert which they are known for. It is a must try and bring cash. They don't accept credit card.
Jen K.}Queens, NY}237}344}3}18}5}5/27/2012}This place is awesome!  The ambience is very relaxing (it has a "hidden" feel), and the presentation and quality of all the food is pretty magical.    It is a small place, so it was packed the entire time I was there (weekend around 4:30pm).I ordered the Saturday lunch set, and it was delicious!  But warning:  if you want to come here for lunch, they offer ONE item each day of the week, so you don't have a choice.  The Sat/Sun lunch set is unagi hitsumabushi don, which was deliciously prepared.  The rice is a subtle blend of different grains, and it is flavored very nicely.  The side dish and pickles also have that special touch from the chef.  For $3 extra you can add dessert to your lunch set, which is totally worth it.  Another word of warning, though, that the chef chooses your dessert for this add-on, so if you're a picky person you might want to forgo this.   However, everyone around you will probably be eating just dessert, so you will be full of regret if you miss out!!  They brought me an adorably presented vanilla ice cream with peaches in strawberry-flavored juice (it tasted like melted sorbet to me).The staff is wonderful and attentive, pouring and refilling my pot of fresh genmaicha (which comes with the lunch set!).  So it was $13 for the lunch set and tea + $3 for dessert - a pretty good deal!This place is great and I'll definitely come back!
Johnny Z.}Manhattan, NY}22}25}0}-1}5}5/22/2012}Even if there were more tea-houses to choose from I think I'd still give Cha-An a pretty good rating.  They're good about refilling your tea so you can drink an obscene amount of tea (on a relevant note, there are nice and clean restrooms here-important because my less generously bladdered date had to use it at least 3 times after we drank way too much tea) and there's a nice assortment of sweets (not too sweet-we're talking "Asian sweet" here) to choose from.  The price is quite reasonable, the staff is friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy to be there with each other (I lost count of how many times they were talking to each other and saying "Sugoi!" about random things), and the service was quite good.I'll admit that I haven't yet tried the regular food here-only the sweets and teas but this is definitely one of my favorite places in the city.  If you love tea, you should definitely go at least once.
Bloss C.}Jersey City, NJ}749}1040}2450}18}4}5/21/2012}Went here for a bridal shower and was impressed by the tastiness of the food.  There was a buffet of several items, the best of which was a simply prepared been sprout cold salad with toasted sesame seeds.  Off the chain good.  Another favorite was the tofu strawberry shortcake desert, it was absolutely amazing!  Service was also fantastic, as was the tea.  Restaurant is small and intimate.  Love the fancy toilet seat in the ladies room, it had several function, and I think I tried them all!
Jane P.}San Francisco, CA}257}229}18}-1}5}5/20/2012}I am giving this place 5 stars because I am not a fan of creme brulee but the black sesame creme brulee was SO GOOD.  WOW.  Just wow.  The scoop of black sesame ice cream on top definitely added to its goodness.  We ordered 2 other items.  One was the 3 pcs of mochi (we got one each of green tea, chocolate, and black sesame).  These were much smaller than I expected, and I thought it would be ice cream but it wasn't.  The chocolate was the best one, but overall, would pass.But I STILL give this place 5 stars my other friend got the scones (earl gray and chocolate) and they smelled/tasted freshly baked and crumbled in our mouths.  drool.
Betty V.}Chicago, IL}478}186}77}-1}3}5/16/2012}Cha-An is a very cute, small teahouse with many unique Japanese-American fusion desserts. It also has an entree menu, but I only came here for desserts. There is a minimum of one order per person, so make sure everyone in your party is ready to spend $$. We ordered the black sesame creme brulee and a matcha green tea special dessert (I already forgot the name). The sesame creme brulee came with a scoop of sake ice cream, and it was fantassssmic! It was not overly sweet, and it had a strong sesame taste. These desserts are really small and pricey but good to try once.
Chloe L.}Irvine, CA}8}99}0}-1}4}5/13/2012}Gooood!!!! Awesome little place with phenomenal dessserts! My favorite? The sesame creme brulee!!
Jiahui L.}Manhattan, NY}32}336}18}18}3}5/11/2012}Food:~smoked salmon thick toast (3.5 stars): smoked salmon was really fresh, and the flavors were well balanced.  But I wish the toast had a milkier flavor, like Taiwanese thick toast.  The toast was indeed thick, but it was a little dried out. $12~soy milk quiche (3 stars): fantastically thick (but not buttery) crust.  But the quiche itself was overcooked.  Perhaps it was the lack of milk, but it was nowhere near as creamy and soft as other quiches. $7~sesame creme brulee (4 stars): delicious, my favorite of the night.  The custard part, however, fell apart texture-wise.  I loved the depth of the black sesame, however. $8~scones (3 stars): large sugar coated outside, but the inside was still a little too doughy. Came with 2.  Clotted cream and marmalade were a delicious accompaniment. $7Wait:~30 min for 2 at 11pm Friday.  Food came out at a moderate pace, and the people who work there are very nice.  Everything was presented beautifully, and the space is very cute.
Jin Y.}Brooklyn, NY}6}732}2358}-1}4}5/8/2012}I had Cha-An bookmarked for ages and finally on a Thursday afternoon I was able to have lunch there. They have different daily lunch specials everyday and I purposely came on Thursday to try their tuna steak don special. The tuna steak was medium rare with just the right amount cooked and OMG the rice was delicious! It's flavored rice not regular plain rice. The special came with their special green tea pot, which they refilled once it was empty. And with a few dollars extra you get to try out their daily special dessert. We had some sort of green tea and chocolate mousse dessert, which of course was just as delicious. It's the cuteness of the presentation that really makes this place unique. I will definitely come back here to try more of their desserts.
Allen L.}San Francisco, CA}74}28}20}-1}5}5/3/2012}When I visited New York this past weekend, my friend asked if I wanted to try some homestyle Japanese cooking. I was totally up for the idea and so we came to Cha-An. For dinner at Cha-An, there are a couple dinner sets to choose from. We ordered the Cha-kago set, which basically consisted of an appetizer, main dish, two side dishes, multi-grain rice and the soup of the day. Dessert is also included and served after the main course. The dishes also vary depending on the day. They don't tell you upfront what's going to be served as a main dish, side dishes, etc., which means they'll cook whatever they feel like that day. But they do ask upfront if you have any allergies or if there's anything that you don't eat. For an extra $5, you can order one of their many specialty teas to complement your meal. When the food came out, I could wait to dig in! What they ended up making that night was a mushroom quiche for an appetizer, mixed vegetable salad, salmon sashimi on watercress, braised pork belly, along with rice and soup as the main course, and mango pudding for dessert. The different dishes were served in small portions, but because there are so many dishes, there's actually a decent amount of food to fill you up. The food was excellent and did indeed have an authentic and homestyle taste to it. The decor resembled that of a cabin, which added even more of a homely feel to the experience. The servers were attentive and friendly and provided good service.I definitely recommend this place and without a doubt, would go back! Truly deserves the average rating of 4.5 / 5 stars.
Yuh-Line N.}New York, NY}951}158}244}18}4}4/21/2012}an authentic home cooked japanese meal.  I love their meal sets because there is just the perfect amount of food.  It is a little on the spendy side, but to have a nice little place to take a good friend for a special occasion, I think it's a perfect spot.  you want to splurge a little, talk a lot, and enjoy that you're treating them.  the mood is nice, service flawless, and for those with dietary restrictions, they are willing to accommodate. I love their matcha drink.  they float just a little bit of sweet red bean in unsugared matcha and it's perfect.  not too sweet but not too bitter.  Their desserts are actually hit or miss to me even though everyone loves their desserts.  I've had a lot of desserts since for the meal sets, they come with whatever the chef decides and I felt that some of them are amazing while others make me head two streets over to spot dessert bar for a real dessert that will hit that sweet spot that I reserve for semi asian desserts.  a nice date place or friends and family place.  you can reserve a tatami room if you call in a party in advance.  you can also order desserts in advance to take with you.  note: it's cash only and because it's upstairs, it's not really ADA accessible which sucks cuz I'd love to take gramma there.ah...and we can't forget the best part.  ladies, the women's bathroom has a toto toilet.  uh huh.  bidet it up and let it blow you dry!  enjoy!
James K.}El Cerrito, CA}232}475}163}18}4}4/20/2012Updatedreview}I went back with a friend, this time to try the desserts and drinks. I got a matcha float and the black sesame creme brulee and my friend got the hibiscus tea and the zenzai dessert. The only complaint I had about the matcha float was that it wasn't a big enough glass. This is one of the best matcha drinks I have had. It tasted refreshing and the matcha flavor was just perfect. The hibiscus tea was delicious as well. I preferred the zenzai over the creme brulee. The sesame flavor was quite dominating in the creme brulee, and I love black sesame, but even between two people we couldn't finish it as it was just quite heavy. The zenzai on the other hand tasted much more refreshing, and I enjoyed all the different components inside particularly the mochi balls that was a perfect texture and also the sake flavor ice cream. I enjoy the desserts more than the meals.
Stephanie T.}New York, NY}39}74}58}-1}4}4/20/2012}This place is an adorable little haven, feels like you're stepping into Japan.  The tea selection here is incredible and food is yummy.  It is very pricey though.  Also be prepared to wait if you come at peak hours.
Mi L.}Manhattan, NY}10}26}0}-1}5}4/19/2012}Came here for lunch specials with a friend at 2 pm. Thursday is tuna stake set at $13 excl. tax. Really good taste, environment and service. Will definitely came back for more lunch specials during the week. I heard the place needs a king wait over the weekend.
R. B.}Bayside, NY}41}29}8}-1}4}4/17/2012}A very nice dessert place to hit up after a cheap, delicious dinner on St. Mark's Place, albeit a bit small and very easy to miss.They have a very large assortment of teas, and always give refills on the pots, which is really nice (but you should limit it to about two, since the flavor of the tea dies down with each resteeping). If you're here for a meal, prepare to fork over a decent amount of cash. Personally, I think it's best to come here on a semi-full stomach as the food here is pretty expensive and isn't really worth it.As for the tea time snacks, I'd say that the best value is the platter that gives you a sampler of all the snacks. Although they are all really yummy, the snacks can be pretty pricey. The Sakura Flan here is my personal favorite, though it's kinda pricey as well (about $7 or $8 dollars).All in all, the dim lighting with the candles on the tabletops create an ambient, sophisticated atmosphere and it's a perfect place to stop by as a conclusive measure to a nice date or a yummy dinner.
Eva D.}Brooklyn, NY}96}31}0}-1}5}4/16/2012}First time I went there was on my birthday last year. I totally loved it. The atmosphere was relaxing and really nice decor, loved the tea and the sweets.I went back there last week with a friend (both of us being a major tea drinker), he loved it also. He's not a big fan of sweets and usually complain about how sweet things are. But he came out telling me, that was the best dessert he ever had. It was the right amount of sugar.Definitely recommend.
Coco S.}San Francisco, CA}318}48}1}-1}5}4/14/2012}If I live in NY, i bet this place will be my frequent hit!An idea day would be having brunch at Balthazar with my girl friend, and then, shopping in SoHo, go Cha-An for afternoon tea! OMG, so perfect. I tried their chef's tasting menu while i was in NY. I just simply love every one of the pieces. A must go if you are around that area
Jordan S.}Manhattan, NY}870}273}672}-1}4}4/2/2012}Pros: Charming decor. Insane selection of teas. The desserts. Actual tea ceremony.Cons: The food itself is pricey, as are some of the desserts. Cash only. Long wait times, and the staff is not so good about taking names for the next open table.  Cha-an is easy to miss, but then again, so is just about everything in this area. You know you're in for an authentic experience as soon as you round the landing of the staircase and see the curtains separating the dining room from the attendant, where there are likely five to ten people anxiously waiting for a seat. Not strangely stitched together furoshiki, and not chintsy beads...real Japanese style room curtains! That may seem an odd thing to focus on(it is), but attention to detail like this permeates Cha-An. I chuckled at the katakana lacing the effortlessly cute menus, and was impressed by the tastefulness of the iron teapots. Equally impressive was the depth to which each type of tea was described. I'm not a tea snob(what a silly thing to be pretentious about...you're drinking broth flavored by leaves...then again, people get psychotic about fermented grape juice and milk solidified through bacterial processes(I'm one of those people when it comes to cheese)), but I felt like one just from reading over the menu. The desserts don't get the same level of attention, sadly, which felt like a missed opportunity. Especially given the fact that some of the desserts could be a little off-putting, for the uninitiated in the world of Japanese sweets and could do with an explanation. It would also add to the whimsical nature of the restaurant to read about the history of the Japanese rendition of pound cake. Excuse me, paundo keeki.In spite of the growing popularity of this place, you never feel as though they need your table. True to the history of the form, drinking tea at Cha-An is a very indulgent and relaxing experience, and feels coolly intimate regardless of how many others are in the restaurant. Treat yo self! You're right, I can't imagine Aziz Ansari here either.
Jon W.}Teaneck, NJ}6}8}0}-1}5}3/31/2012}This place is small, intimate, and lovely tea house. This is one of my favorite place in NYC!  Great for tea and desserts. Meet up with your friends and enjoy!
Kate H.}Glendale, Los Angeles, CA}0}25}1}-1}3}3/30/2012}I do not know why this place is so popular for dessert. The service is great. But their verbena tea, and green tea roll with sake ice cream were nothing special. I think you could make a better tea yourself with lupicia. But well I did not yet try their cream brulee. So maybe I will give another chance next time.
Sam C.}San Francisco, CA}0}33}0}-1}5}3/24/2012}One of the must-go in St. Marks if you can get a spot. The food is Japanese but with a western twist that makes it interesting and unexpected. They also have a wide selection of Japanese tea. Plus, the desserts are very tasty as well (again with a somewhat western twist). The atmosphere is also very well, a good place to come with a small group of friends while drinking tea and catching up on life. Definitely one of my favorite places to go to in town.
Kimberly K.}Rowland Heights, CA}162}60}1}-1}5}3/21/2012}Note:  This review is only for desserts!Arrived at this cute little Japanese restaurant around 10 pm for dessert.  It's a hidden gem on the second story of a building with a narrow staircase leading up to it. My boyfriend ordered the green team cake roll with sake ice cream, and I ordered some kind of strawberry layered ice cream. We ended up waiting for about 15- 20 min for our dessert to arrive, ands to our surprise, our waitress brought out our desserts, along with two macaroons and a pot of tea to apologize for the delay. Such good customer service, and we didn't even complain about the wait!  The dessert presentation was extremely cute, and tasted really good without being o erwhelmingly sweet. Macaroons with soft and lightly flaky on the outside, and the tea was very flavorful. Sake ice cream was extremely unique. Will definitely come here again on my next visit to NYC!
Diana C.}Stanford, CA}148}59}7}-1}4}3/21/2012}Come when they first open (during the week) to steal a table faster. The best way to experience cha-an is probably to order their set dishes. The 15 grain porridge is okay- a tad on the sweet side but do-able. I had the chicken soboro-don and it was savory. Make sure you ask the waitress if the tea that you went for matches the meal.. sometimes you can pick the totally wrong tea (as my companion did) and the dishes are just thrown off. this is not the place to bring a grown man who is starving. the portions are small-- but you won't leave hungry. Try the desserts-- especially the black sesame creme brulee and chocolate souffle. it's heavenly.
Mariko M.}Toronto, Canada}193}844}1189}18}4}3/18/2012}Great place for tea and sweets.Located on the second floor, seats are limited here.List of teas is extensive; teas aren't only Japanese.Dessert menu was just as big. I had the black sesame seed mochi, which was one of the specials of the day. There are also macarons, which are different flavored based on the day of the week.Will be back !
Christina C.}Brooklyn, NY}3}13}423}-1}5}3/13/2012}Hidden in a second floor is this gem of coziness and delicious food all bundled up into one. The staff is always friendly even when there's a long line and you know people are trying for their patience.  (They even ask if any one has any food allergies prior to taking your order - yay no need to break out the Benedryl! jk jk - In all seriousness, I think it's great they do that.)They have one of the largest tea selections available and all are brewed fresh for you.  The food - omg - so delicious.  Typically served on a basket-like platter, each dish is proportioned off into small dainty dishware.  But don't let that fool you into thinking, "Aw dude! That is not going to keep me full! Where's the MEAT?!"   Sigh, us silly carnivores. They've proportioned it off so well that halfway through eating, you will start feeling full.  Made with fresh ingredients, the food always tastes delicious.  There are 2 main "Cha-An" sets to choose from - one can choose any of the 2 and you won't go wrong.  (Though some people may not be too partial to the Rice Porridge - it's really quite delicious)  They've also got an afternoon tea and lunch specials.My most favorite part - DESSERT (not that the main course was not delicious enough already.)  The dessert is my most favorite part mostly because they try to serve everyone a different type of dessert and you don't know what you'll get.    Silly, I know - but to me that is incredibly intriguing - almost like opening those 'surprise' kidrobot figurine boxes. Their dessert is always heavenly.  There are many different types - ranging from black sesame creme brulee, chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce, strawberries and creme, ice cream and mochi with red beans.. it goes on and on.  The chef comes up with all these great ideas and mixtures.  My only peeve about this place is the incredibly long line and wait time. But it is great for Cha-An and the food and dessert is well worth the wait  :)
Rick L.}New York, NY}0}9}0}-1}1}3/12/2012}Heard about this place over and over from my friends, and finally got to try it out in person the other day. I think this place is totally overrated. Can't believe they actually refuse to take credit card, and you're required to order at least one set per person, even if you're already ordering a set with tea and everything, this place sucks in opinion, no place that make great and authentic food will require customer to order certain amount as one would automatically order more if food is good, so you guess the level of quality there. Plus,seats are extremely uncomfortable, price is alright but the stuffs did not "wow" me at all, mediocre at most. Try another one.
Maureen D.}Manhattan, NY}16}113}44}-1}4}3/8/2012}I'd actually give this place a 4.5. I've only ever been here for dessert and tea, so I can't comment on their dinner, but their tea and dessert have always been delicious. I just wish their prices were a bit cheaper. It's a really nice place to come to after dinner though. A really tiny place, but I've never had to wait long. The interior is really cool. Cozy atmosphere with all the tea jars lined up in front of the kitchen. I'd definitely recommend it. It'd be the perfect place to take a date after a nice dinner!oh and it should be noted that this place is CASH ONLY. so if you do decide to take a date here, make sure you got some dough on ya to avoid an embarassing/awkward moment!
Grace G.}Manhattan, NY}0}46}0}-1}4}3/7/2012}went there for a saturday lunch with some friends and we were well treated! very cozy and finely decorated place with deliciously food and tea.
Chrissy C.}CANAL STREET, NY}52}313}14}-1}4}3/6/2012}only had dessert & tea (asit was my last spot of the night of a long day of fat assery)...  had the black sesame ice cream brule and some chocolate raspberry concoction.  both were delicious!  favored the first a little more though.  i dunno, maybe i just love black sesame ice cream though.. (which i also had at EN JB and LOVED!!!).  everything is pretty reasonably priced...  since it is a really cute spot.  old school japanese vibe..  dimly lit.  if ur on a first date...  girl would prob be impressed and all "awwwwww" *picture picture picture*  since they were all about pretty presentation.  actually...  doesnt even have to be first date.  since my boyfriend did do that -_-  hahhaha.  as for tea, we had the flower tea.  yeah it was gimmicky...  but, i'm all about that.  hahahhaa.  so, i was solddddd (pictures uploaded).  as for the taste?  it tasted like tea.  lol, i really dont know what else to say about that.  it wasnt too sweet and it wasnt bitter.  i dont know how to particularly describe it.
nguyet l.}Cambridge, MA}1}28}0}-1}4}3/5/2012}Amazing. The cuisine holds true to its Japanese  heritage:Box lunches have very earthy flavors. Every dish is aesthetically pleasing. Fish dishes are fresh and have a please aroma. NOTE: all the dishes compliment their tea! So choose the tea first and then ask for recommendations.The desserts are out of this world. sweet but not over powering. again all desserts compliment the tea Service was wonderful. The waitresses were fast, polite, and cater to you well. this place has but one fault: it doesn't accept credit cards.
DT T.}Denver, CO}4}38}8}-1}5}3/4/2012}I ordered the Sunday lunch special, which happened to be the unagi-don.  The multi-grain rice really enhanced the entree, absolutely delicious!  This place is very charming and the staff was very attentive.  It is kind of small, so I do not think it's a good place for large groups.
Megan Y.}New York, NY}28}22}1}-1}5}3/4/2012}I think this is my favorite place to eat now! Most people come here for dessert but I thought the food was great!Good selection of quality teas, highlighting the tastiest and most important varieties, served on tea ware that I love drinking out of. Bf ordered the daily special (chicken teriyaki don) which was only $13 and came with a side dish and genmaicha. The chicken was absolutely delicious, very juicy and succulent with a slightly crispy exterior and lightly flavoured teriyaki. It was better than any teriyaki I have had before. I was blown away by the rice - a multigrain variety with crisp bits of barley or whole kernel of wheat to add crunch and texture. I felt really wholesome eating it. I ordered the afternoon tea set which was only $18 for 2 mini bagels, and 5 baked goods. The bagels were adorable and crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside - I love all things mini.  The raspberry butter filling was sinfully delectable. Baked goods consisted of scones (excellent), matcha cake (so-so), and green tea macaroon (ok - but I'm biased after becoming a Pierre Herme/Laduree snob after October in Paris)Food and drink: 5 starsAtmosphere: 5 starsService: 5 starPrice: 5 stars especially if you are ordering the specialsCozy and cuteness: 5 starsSeriously. I haven't felt this happy and satisfied after a meal in a long time. We were almost in tears.
Nuch P.}Elmhurst, NY}62}137}10}-1}4}3/3/2012}black sesame creme brulee (drooling just thinking about it).  the place is intimate and somewhat sensual.   the place is small and gets crowded pretty fast.  it's a bit pricey so don't go there too hungry.  we just happened to finished our meal at a japanese restaurant and just wanted to try something nice for deserts.
Lelia T.}Brooklyn, NY}92}107}191}-1}4}3/2/2012}This place is super cute! I came here on a rainy afternoon after eating lunch and the environment is very cozy, like the Japanese teahouses you see in movies. The place isn't big, so its perfect if you have a party of 2.The restaurant is very clean, warm, and easy on the eyes. Decorations are so nice! They even have a little room with mats, but it was closed when I got there. They have pages of pictures on their menu and it takes so long to decide what you want! My friend and I were literally deciding for 20 minutes, which brought to my attention the great service they have there. The waitress asked if we were ready and I asked for a few more minutes. She very kindly and enthusiastically said "Sure!" and didn't come bother us until we finally said we were ready. I ordered the black sesame creme brulee based on the reviews I've read and yes, it's pretty good! I'm a big fan of hot and cold desserts. This one had cold black sesame paste on the bottom, topped with warm black sesame in the middle, then the layer of caramelized sugar, and finally a scoop of ice cream (I think it was black sesame swirled in vanilla). The mixture was delicious! Especially the ice cream. I'd recommend it if you like black sesame. My friend got the sake ice cream with green tea rolls, and that was pretty good too. The green tea rolls had mousse inside and it had so much green tea flavor! And so soft. The ice cream actually had some sake taste to it which was an interesting touch. We also ordered two kinds of tea. They were big cups/pots for around $6-8. I ordered the seasonal Matcha Tea w/Red Beans. It tasted okay before my dessert, but was extremely bitter after my dessert. Haha. I should have asked for suggestions. Anyway, I would definitely come back here for a relaxing day. We actually spent over 2 hours here and it's just a great place to talk. I didn't feel rushed at all. Oh and the bathroom is really cute! Just like Japanese ones with all the buttons. I judge a lot of places by their bathrooms and am usually hesistant to use them. But for this one, no criticisms here.
Lisa W.}New York, NY}13}33}17}-1}4}3/1/2012}Super cute place for Japanese tea and dessert. My friend and I came here after a long several hours of shopping.. Apparently a lot of places in this hood close around 3 to prepare for dinner service. Yelp to the rescue! This place was 0.3 miles from where we were standing.Our experience started at the entrance. There are beautiful photos of their desserts welcoming you upstairs. Once seated, we just stared at the plethora of teas and tea equipment. Sitting at the bar, we got prime seats to seeing the masters prepare tea (with all sorts of tools). Too bad we are coffee fanatics for life. We got the green tea mochi and black sesame creme brûlée. The former was great, but the latter is the best dessert I have ever had! The scoop of black sesame ice cream with crispy wafer on top really nailed it!The desserts were 5 stars, but the pricy-ness takes a star away. We thought the food here was too pricey, so after our delectable dessert break, we hopped to a more budget friendly locale.
Wendee M.}Brooklyn, NY}261}187}31}-1}5}2/29/2012}I love this place! First time here for tea and dessert. The waitress was so sweet I wanted to put green tea ice cream on her arm and bite down.We got the green tea truffle and black sesame creme brulee and some chamomile tea. It was different than I had expected but in a good way.  Oh wait no, there was definitely sake. Very good sake. I've recommended this place to several people and they've all thanked me. Now if only I can convince them to lend me $1.
JiaJia T.}Hauppauge, NY}409}385}557}18}3}2/29/2012}Small, cute little restaurant with friendly service.We ordered the black sesame creme brulee and the chef's choice with green tea.   The chef's choice started with sake ice cream, then followed by flan and some chocolate cookie sandwiched by creamy center, and raspberry macaron and green tea biscotti.  I must say my favorite was the black sesame creme brulee.  It was good but not mindblowing good.  The others were fine but nothing I would order again.  My second favorite being the macaron.  All in all, a nice way to have a relaxing afternoon with tea and desserts.
Angel F.}Houston, TX}184}142}4}-1}4}2/26/2012}I don't know very much about tea (as I drink republic or tazo); so, I can't really speak to the quality.  But I can say that service was outstanding.  My friend and I stopped here on a Friday night around 8 PM to put our name on the list (the wait was 2 hours for a party of 2).  Upon our return, we each ordered a cup of tea and we were very well taken care of.  Never once did our server express any disdain for our low ticket.  Charming place.
Jess C.}New York, NY}593}305}582}-1}4}2/25/2012}Great place for dessert after a light dinner. They do have food options, but never had. The place is pricey but great place to impress.Absolutely love the decor and ambience. You feel like you stepped into a Japanese tea house -- a great escape from the NYC streets.Love their teas and desserts! Especially for the price of their teas, I'm so glad you get refills haha. I also like being able to brew my own tea (I like mine super light). Their Black Sesame Creme Brulee definitely lived up to its hype and the mochi ice cream helped us cleanse our palate (from dinner).The service is also wonderful. The ladies are very attentive so I always try to be more generous with tip.Yes it's true it's cash only!!
Stephanie C.}Manhattan, NY}301}289}25}-1}3}2/25/2012}Had to lower my rating for this place. There is minimum order per person which I thought was quite terrible, so the tea doesn't count? unless that waitress just wanted us to order more stuff(old review)Yay for ambiance! However I came here for the tea and it was great except they gave us a really tiny teapot! We ordered the same tea as the table next to us but ours was half the size! It's just annoying to have the ask the waitress to refill our pot 10 times =.=. But I gave them an extra star because the chocolate souffle was amazing! Not too sweet and the chocolate center just oozes softly out. Didn't care much for the green tea ice cream in bread though even though it was highly recommended.
Michelle T.}New York, NY}319}971}1072}18}5}2/22/2012}Came here for a nice lunch with the boyfriend and it was AMAZING. First, I must really comment on the service. The waitresses and waiters here are very attentive and nice. They always seemed to know whenever we needed a refill and exactly when we're finished eating. The boyfriend got their Friday Lunch Special - the Salmon TarTar Don, which was major nom. I got their Set B Lunch, which was basically a full range of what they have to offer in terms of hot food. It was so good! The side dishes change everyday so it was a surprise as to what I would get. I was very happy with the day's selection - Mushrooms/shrimp in a cream sauce and sautéed greens. The dessert was DIVINE. We had their green tea souffle and GAH. There are no words to describe it. It was that good.I definitely want to be back to try their tea sets. I've heard such great things about their desserts that I want some now!!
Shannon Z.}Brooklyn, NY}447}705}446}18}4}2/17/2012}Prices are a bit high here for dessert but since it's the city and it's an authentic Japanese place I'll give it 4 stars. Came here for desert after dinner at Klong for a friends birthday. We didn't make reservations so a table for 7 people was a good hour wait. What a kill. If you're planning to come here, please make reservations, especially on a Friday night! I'm warning you, if you don't you'll be waiting quite a while. Anyway after we sat down, we were given these cute box shaped menus to choose our dessert. I chose the black sesame creme brulee and boy was it delicious. If only I wasn't already full from Klong's thai food, I think I would have enjoyed this place much more. Sesame flavor was definitely not lacking in my creme brulee. I enjoyed this light dessert very much. The only thing I wasn't too fond of with this dish was the bitterness of the caramelized top this brulee had. I couldn't eat it by itself and had to resort to eating it with the sesame ice cream provided in the dessert. It didn't taste as bad but I'm not too fond of the caramelized top... It was way too bitter for my liking. Payed $10 for sesame creme brulee including tax/(automatic 18% tip for a party of 5). $10 is decent for a dessert here but I won't be coming back here much unless needed. I've got to come back here to try their vast assortment of teas though!
Min K.}Manhattan, NY}70}213}75}-1}4}2/17/2012}only came here for dessert.- black sesame creme brulee (GET THISSSSSS)- sweet potato apple cake (not bad, but not as memorable after you've eaten the sesame creme brulee).side note: why is this place hot as balls? geez.....
Lisy C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}3}0}-1}4}2/15/2012}FINALLY got to try Cha An this time. I went there last week but the place was too packed so we left. My friend and I went yesterday again to give it a second try.Environment   9/10Food                9.5/10Price                9/10Why 4 stars? This place is on the second floor, and when the place is packed like sardines, people just waiting on the stairs. People who are trying to get out have so much trouble. COME ON, DON't you see we r trying to make room for you!?Desserts are great. Not too sweet, portion is good.Totally recommended, but if you have time, try to go early to avoid LOOOOOOOONGG waits and people pushing!Loved LOVED LOVEEDDD their chocolate souffle and sesame creme brulee!
Victoria H.}Brooklyn, NY}122}74}22}-1}5}2/13/2012}Dragged my bf here because i wanted him to try this place out. I had already tried their stuff here a month before with my bestie...and i knew he would love this place. And he did! We ordered the unagi don special ( they raised their price to $13 and changed the hours for the special from 7 to 6). Each bite of rice and the unagi was very flavorful. I could eat one all by myself hehe. Also ordered the six small appetizers. The apps vary from time to time so it will be different. I was actually surprised that i finished it because there were some stuff that i usually wouldn't eat like squash and this other veggie thing that i usually wouldn't touch if my mom cooked them. But i don't know...maybe they put some crack to make it so delicious lolAnd of course...you can't go to Cha-An without ordering dessert =] ordered the sesame creme brulee - very creamy and lots of black sesame flavor, and the strawberry pie - more like a strawberry on a puff tart but it was still very delicious and wonderfully plated. Definitely come back again and try the the green tea roll with sake ice cream!
Su W.}New York, NY}32}44}19}-1}5}2/9/2012}Reading the reviews made this place seem expansive and so had been hesitant to go for a while till recently when I finally took a chance because a friend from CA came for a visit and let me say this as a summary: it's amazing and DECENTLY priced. The place is very small. Only a small area awaits you when you go up the stairs leading you to the place. You may encounter wait list but from my experience it was worth it. You are greeted with friendly service and (what i consider to be) a thick book as menu for treats and I strongly advise you to first take a look or if you're impatient order chefs selection though be very careful the desserts will be based off what tea you order. And you may not find it fitting to your preference (as I did) but the treats if judged with no preference bias was delicious. The chef selection I ordered was only $17 and got: tea of choice + 3 decently sized dessert. So almost like $4-5 for each part of the selection. And I've been to places where the dessert are the same price but not of good quality as this place.Side note: the bathroom is amazing. The toilet is very high tech. Now for things to know before going to this place:1. CASH ONLY!!!2. EVERY ONE has to order something. Not negatives things I would put into considering when taking a look at this place but thing you should know before heading there. ESPECIALLY the CASH ONLY. Hope you have a great time there.
Jia Z.}Cherry Hill, NJ}31}52}28}-1}5}2/1/2012}Interestingly good. Loved the sake with tea and mochi w ice cream dessert.  They have a lot of different types of teas and desserts.  They even have a little tea-bar.  Place is not big, but very quiet and intimate. Great for snacking while chatting with friends.
Huong N.}South Hadley, MA}1}8}0}-1}5}1/28/2012}We visited this place in October after a very long (and tiring walk or so they whined) and I wasn't expecting it to be anything fancy. Peter just wanted his flan badly...and Cha-An seasonally serves earl grey flan which we NEVER had the chance to try. We, however, tried their buns/dumplings that are not on the menu online, their signature cha-an toast and the four-course dessert. The buns were okay but the toast, they were PHENOMENAL. I was never that happy about something that looks like a toast because toast is just not my delicious bite ever really. But Cha-an knows how to make it tasty and you just can't tell what they did with it.The tea was mhm, I cannot make a judgement since I switched drink with someone and therefore, I had Chai which didn't flow very well for me. But maybe Peter's oolong was better. I'd say, skip the tea because it's pricy. If you wish, do the tea ceremony for 15 bucks per person. They also serve a lot of other things that you kind of need to be there before 7pm to try (which was not our case so til next time).And if you've been here, don't even think about going to Spot because Cha-An is just so much better in terms of atmosphere and food hands down.
Yong C.}San Jose, CA}25}69}98}-1}5}1/24/2012}"Cha" in most asian languages means "Tea". This place is primarily a japanese tea house. Very stylish and quaint. Located on the second floor around the 'japanese town' area. Do not confuse this place so much for a restaurant, although you can order a full meal here. This place is mostly known for it's tea and the tea is fantastic. They have little desserts and the menu can be a bit confusing. The waitresses are japanese and will give you a good run down on what teas they offer and which is caffeinated and which is decaf. I'm not much of a dessert person so I didn't dive in for the dessert. I'd recommend this place for the experience and a great date place.
Crisann S.}New York, NY}13}49}0}-1}4}1/24/2012}Hated walking up the narrow staircase, but once inside, you'll discover a small quiet retreat.  You feel like you're actually in another world.  The waiters were very attentive and refilled our tea without us asking for it.  We came here for a Sunday lunch and ordered the lunch special (rice w/eel- unagi hitsumabushi don).  The rice was a mixed rice and was very good but it came with only 4 small pieces of eel.  I also had the matcha latte w/red beans, not bad.  We also had the smoked salmon toast, which I would skip next time.  The one at Kyotofu was better.  I would come back here for a catch up with a friend or for desserts if I were in the neighborhood.
Chichia D.}Manhattan, NY}0}2}0}-1}2}1/23/2012}I used to come here occasionally with my friends but after dining there tonight for the first time in a while, I don't plan on going back. The food is still delicious, but the prices have gone up significantly within the past year, and the service today was sub-par. The cha-an set (basically a prix fixe) used to be $19 and tea was free. Now its $23 plus an additional $5 for the tea = $28 total. (I know restaurants are hurting during this recession, but a $9 price hike in half a year really turns me off). We had to keep on reminding the waitress to refill our teapot, which was never a problem before. To add to the insult, after paying $50 for a $45.5 meal ($4.5 tip), she came up to me and said "You must have misunderstood. This is only a 10% tip. If there was a problem with the service, let us know, but we expected a $7 tip so please add 2 or 3 more dollars". This was the first time I've been scolded by a waiter who automatically expects a 15% tip regardless of the service. It really annoyed me, and that's what prompted me to write this review.
Alex R.}New York, NY}138}168}118}-1}4}1/21/2012}*CASH ONLY* Black sesame creme brulee. Keeps me coming back here all the time! It's a great place to sit and talk to friends after dinner or what not, over a hot pot of tea and some perfectly sized desserts. The red bean matcha green tea is also to die for!The place is small but usually there's not much of a wait. Sometimes it's hard to grab their attention for a refill depending where you're sitting. Typical pricing for Asian tea/dessert cafes.
Juliet K.}Arlington, VA}269}500}56}18}3}1/20/2012}this was my first time to a legit tea house. it was strange seeing them do some of the things, such as opening up the tea leaves by getting them warm but not letting it steep. there was a huge selection of teas and also small plates. since we already ate, we ordered some desserts and tea. we got one green tea and one oolong tea. the green tea was one from japan that was considered "light" except I thought it was really strong. and there was a lot of debris in the tea as well even though there was a strainer in the tea pot. the oolong that we got was dong ding. THIS was a great light tea. loved it. and they kept bringing out hot water for us to pour so i felt like we really got our money's worth with the tea. desserts: pork balls wrapped in sticky rice. it was decent, but without the vinegary sauce its pretty bland. the raspberry chocolate souffle was pretty darn tasty. i wouldnt have expected that from a japanese tea house place. we also ordered some sweet potato and apple dessert thing. each of the elements alone were kinda weird, but if you ate a little bit of everything in one bite it was pretty freakin delicious... overall it was good, but i felt it was a bit over priced for the tiny plates and tea. i'd be interested in going back and actually trying the food. everyone there seemed to like it a lot and all the tables were taken the whole time we were there.
Valerie L.}San Francisco, CA}235}622}2}18}5}1/18/2012}Four words: black sesame creme brulee.Cha An is a retreat from the hustle and bustle below, with its simple, traditional decor and enticing menu. You can sample some of their unique desserts, like the aforementioned black sesame creme brulee (why would you ever say no to this), sweet potato cake, ice creams, etc. Perhaps you'd like some tea with your dessert? Well, Cha An is right up your alley--you can choose from a variety of teas or even do a tea ceremony.It took me three attempts to finally try Cha An. The first time, it was closed for a private event, and then the wait was over an hour long. But third time's the charm, and charmed I was. The only drawback is that it is cash only, but hey, that's New York for you.I would go back ASAP if it weren't for that annoying New Year's resolution of mine to go easy on the sweets. That creme brulee was seriously just...rich, textured, sweet, creamy, interesting, and DIVINE. Back off, it's mine!
Ann G.}New York, NY}0}23}1}-1}5}1/17/2012}They fit my boyfriend and I in for a tea ceremony on my birthday even though they were booked. The lovely woman who did the tea ceremony was elegant and very nice. It was a really special experience. At $15 a person for sweets + tea, it's a steal too.I've been here for regular service too. Their food, desserts and tea are quite good. One of my favorite places.
See S.}New York, NY}1}39}18}-1}3}1/15/2012}they are not good as before, I went there last year n love it. However last week I have dinner there felt disappointed. they need add'l $5 for the tea, now the meal excl any tea. Besides, the desserts were not good. It just a small pound cake with cream. terrible! But the service still very good. so I give 3 stars.  However not worth to go again.
My T.}Brooklyn, NY}11}19}15}-1}4}1/14/2012}Went here with a girlfriend to chit chat and chill, was very nice because it was quiet and intimate where we didn't have to yell at each other to talk. Very Japanese decor and bathroom was super clean (which is always a plus in my book). Dessert was really good, not too sweet but just right. Had the flower tea to compliment desserts, which was mild to medium, good choice. Would def go back.
Erica S.}Manhattan, NY}277}210}26}-1}5}1/10/2012}One of the best places to get Asian desserts!Anne K and I went there on a Saturday night and had to wait around 30mins for a table which wasn't bad at at all, given that it was a Saturday night and the place is pretty tiny.The venue is pretty cozy so you can either ask to be seated at your own table our sit at the limited bar space. We sat at a table for 2 and ordered the black sesame creme brulee and mochi combo (earl grey chocolate and green tea) and both were amazing! The creme brulee was def the preferred. It has an amazing texture and taste -- creamy and sweet but not too overwhelming and the black sesame flavor is surprisingly pretty mild. The mochi were also delicious-- the chocolate def better than the green tea. The chocolate and earl grey go really well together but the green tea was a little off. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to grab some delicious Japanese desserts in cozy setting :)
Lans S.}Los Angeles, CA}54}417}120}-1}5}1/8/2012}My goodness. I love. Everything about this place is pleasantly nostalgic. The menu offers a variety of filling, flavorful Ochazuke that satiates in a nourishing, home-cooked way. The tasteful Japanese ambiance and impeccable service complete the experience. You can easily forget you're in EVill and let the atmosphere whisk you away to the Far East.
Anne K.}Philadelphia, PA}467}409}104}18}4}1/8/2012}Rave-worthy desserts, for sure. If you're craving something sweet (but not overwhelmingly so), Cha-An has a black sesame creme brulee with your name on it. It also comes with a generous scoop of black sesame ice cream on top. I love how their mochi is mostly filling and very little dough - their green tea mochi is pretty conventional, but the chocolate mochi is exquisite!
Mike L.}Newburgh, NY}222}396}440}18}5}1/7/2012}Great place for a date, just go. Don't ruin the magic by looking at the pictures of the aesthetics of the confections. Just go!I tried the matcha. It was good but I would recommend getting one of the cheaper teas that are equally great like the oolongs. The raspberry chocolate souffle won over my girlfriend. The black sesame creme brûlée was good. My friends didn't like the filling of the mochi, it was really dense like butter.
Sharon T.}Queens, NY}820}1030}1726}18}4}1/6/2012}Anyone who knows me, knows I don't drink coffee. I drink tea.I've been hearing so much raves about Cha-An's desserts, I have been tempted to go  for the past year. The day finally came one night when a friend and I were coveting desserts in the area. I've only been to Spot, which is ridiculously expensive for small amounts, and we didn't feel like walking over to the next block for ChikaLicious (we are both very lazy people when it comes to cold weather).So we walked to this bookmarked place of mine, to a very small door that leads to a flight to stairs (dammit, we can't turn back now) and a very, very crowded waiting area. Within 10 minutes, they called us up to seat us down. We got the dessert set with lemon verbena tea. Keep in mind that there is no particular dessert. They will give you some things and the other people at the next table will get different things. It's very random. However, we did get some adequate sweets I liked. Some were too sweet for my taste but I tried to endure as much as possible. I especially loved the mixed berries in vanilla ice cream with a sesame cracker on the side - the ice cream was delicious and a great mix with vanilla ice cream; it was probably the only thing I liked out of all the desserts because the others were too sweet for my taste. I did love the creamy cookie though. The cream was delicious! Other desserts that were served to us was a raspberry macaroon, chocolates, kumquat and bread & oil with raspberry butter. Excellent presentation. I really enjoyed the tea, although I taste no difference from other teas I've had before but it left a very calm feeling throughout the night (which I have never felt before) and I've never felt so relaxed and at ease.I wish I had some of the good desserts other people had like mochi, creme brulee, and cake. I will definitely be coming back here again! Fyi, it is cash only. We almost couldn't leave because we didn't have cash with us!
Sammy B.}Brooklyn, NY}52}331}2}18}4}1/5/2012}I don't like tea really, but what I do like is good dessert, and this place has some damn good dessert!  Black sesame creme brulee - YUMMAY.  Had something else that was with ice cream and strawberries & rasberries, the image of it is highlighted in the menu.  That was incredibly YUMMAY.  Tried the Ceylon Orange Pekoe black tea... It was... tea.... haha.  Bottom line, dessert here is damn good!
Justin S.}Tappan, NY}109}16}5}-1}3}12/29/2011}The Black Sesame Creme Brule did not disappoint, as well as the sake ice cream, but the chef's assortment was a HUGE disappointment. Caramel was burnt and macaron was underbaked. Avoid the Chef's assortment.
Shan K.}ASTORIA, NY}7}46}8}-1}5}12/28/2011}Loved their dessert. The sesame creme brulee is one of the best ever.
Mijune C.}New York, NY}43}98}0}-1}3}12/28/2011}Went for dinner on a busy night and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. It's a small tea house and that's exactly what I should have went there for..tea & dessert. The set meal was something I could have ate at home, it's just rice with some little pickled side dishes/salad, nothing special at all. Although the set comes with endless green tea and a nice dessert, I don't think I would choose to have the set meal again. For authentic Japanese food, I'd recommend Aburiya Kinnosuke but for dessert, this place is good because they are open late.
Joel B.}Manhattan, NY}8}23}12}-1}5}12/24/2011}Two enthusiastic thumbs up, especially for Japanese or Tea enthusiasts, or Japanese Tea enthusiasts.I had the Fukamushi Sencha and the Rice Porridge set with Japanese vegetable toppings (they readily adapted this for vegetarian diet).Dessert was Matcha Mochi balls, delicious.Very affordable at $18-22 for the set menus including tea.They refill your Kyusu readily. Atmosphere was very pleasant, authentic Japanese decor.Highly recommended, can't wait to return.
Ayuka H.}New York, NY}23}40}3}-1}5}12/22/2011}The atmosphere and the food are both great! Note that this might not be a good place for guys since the portion is pretty small and there are fewer things that fit guys' taste...
Liz T.}Los Angeles, CA}391}382}102}18}5}12/21/2011}One minute strolling the garbage-smelling streets of New York, next minute, IN A TINY LITTLE JAPANESE TEA HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE!! My friend and I were looking for a cute dessert/tea place after stuffing our faces at Momofuku and so we YELPED to find this hidden treasure. You go up a tiny flight of stairs and literally, everything inside is so exquisite and Japanese. The menu is great -- pages and pages of teas and desserts. You can also order what seemed like a very authentic Japanese meal here (tiny little bento like boxes with all kinds of food!). Neither of us are Japanese, but we felt like this might be the closest thing to spending a quiet night in Tokyo! LOVED. Plus, you know an Asian place is legit when they have the toilet from the future with air puffs, perfume, and multiple direction bidet. BOOM!
Patty T.}New York, NY}130}283}6}-1}5}12/21/2011}What Asian doesn't love some tea after dinner?  Exactly so who better to rate this place.  LOVE it!!  Super cute spot with tons of tea & amazing desserts.    My friend and I got the napoleon fruit dessert.. delish.  Oh yeah the bidet in bathroom is a can't miss!!!
William H.}Los Angeles, CA}192}653}312}18}4}12/7/2011}If you love green tea, come here. A wide selection awaits, from more grassy teas to teas that have a "hint of sea breeze"--my personal favorite. We also got the green tea mochi, which was pretty delicious.
Michelle C.}New York, NY}66}38}4}-1}5}12/5/2011}Love Love coming to this place with a friend. Great place to chit chat and drink tea since I'm not into coffee. The desserts here are decadent with an asian flare. I recommend the black sesame custard and the chocolate souffle o.m.g. its the best. I don't recommend the mochi i think they are too sweet. Also, they use Kangen water which has amazing health benefits due to its alkaline nature.
Coco P.}San Francisco, CA}2}20}3}-1}5}12/5/2011}I absolutely love the Japanese desserts.My favorites are: Zenzai (matcha green tea with mochi, red bean paste, chestnut, and sake ice cream)black sesame creme bruleeGREEN TEA ROLL CAKE is my absolute favorite. It always runs out when you go there like later at night, so if you want to get it, go a little earlier.Despite how delicious the desserts are, the wait is pretty long, usually from 30-50 minutes. However, they accept reservations on Thursdays, so that's something you can do.Oh and they only accept cash.
Claire O.}New York, NY}1}119}1}-1}5}12/1/2011}Holly Golightly can have Tiffany's -- Cha-an is my favorite place in NYC, the place I go when I want to feel cocooned in peaceful luxury, like absolutely nothing can go wrong.  Cha-an is always a lovely experience from start to finish -- the space is cozy and intimate, the service is sweet and warm, the tea/dessert menu is extensive and every item is unfailingly delicious.  I have a particular soft spot for the black sesame creme brulee (the sugar crust crackles to Amelie-like perfection under your spoon, and the earthy/nutty black sesame flavor is a great foil for all that dairy richness) and the honey oolong tea.  The only thing that keeps me from coming more often is the distance from my neighborhood.  If you haven't tried it, you're missing out -- don't forget to bring cash, and get a glass of their special kangen water on the side to re-learn what water should taste like!
R Y.}Manhattan, NY}43}270}340}-1}4}11/29/2011}Tea + dessert courseFirst off, the rating isn't 5 stars because they re-use the same tea leaves when refilling your tea. Still, their tea leaves are still good the first 3 times.I personally thought that their dessert course was worth the best. For $16 bucks, you get tea in pot constantly re-filled, icecream, main course dessert (paired with tea), and cookie/ petites at the end. Absolutely delicious...I remember having puff pastry with green tea cream, banana/ chocolate mousse with soft cake for main dish. The cookies I ate almost all because my friend got the cookie platter option one. Their macroons are fresh, their sesame seed cookies are not too sweet and nutty and their raspberry sauce that comes with the cookies are sooo good with the freshly whipped cream.I have to say though, their pound cake was a little dry....Still, the overall experience was great. Nice warm tea, great tasting desserts.One downside is that you can't bring big crowds. It's more for 2-4 (max). I guess 6 can squeeze in, but your wait may be longer than 2, 3 or 4~!Also, this place is cash only, so make sure you have it with you!
Xiao H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}0}-1}4}11/26/2011}Love the ambiance of this place. I've been to this place with my BF several times for tea, food and dessert. We'll keep coming back!
Carmen Y.}San Francisco, CA}118}189}50}-1}5}11/25/2011}Oh Cha-An, I've missed you so dearly!!!  Hands down one of my absolute favorite restaurants in all of NYC.  Yea, it's that serious.  I kid you not.  I mean, just read the rest of the reviews.Authentic Japanese cuisines.Ridiculously delicious desserts! (Amazing presentation too)Extensive list of exotic teas.Sweetest staff.Warm ambiance.I always opt for one of the set meals, particularly Set B that consists of the following:Soup of the day2 side dishes of the day (I've had dishes ranging from fish, eggplant, chicken, tofu, etc.)Soy milk quiche w/mushrooms and scallionsTea smoked salmon15 grain riceDessert (amaaaaazing creations here and just so incredibly yummy!)Your choice of TeaAll of that for just $22.  That's an awesome dealOk like seriously, Cha-An is absolutely amazing and I can't stop praising it cause it's just so damn good.  Yes, it's THAT good.  Damn, I'm feeling nostalgic now and wanna be back in NYC so badly!!!! CASH ONLY.
Brian T.}Staten Island, NY}128}22}8}-1}5}11/18/2011}Not much to say what's already been said. This place is great to try different types of tea and their desserts are superb! Black sesame creme brulee is ridiculously delicious, I am certainly addicted! They do require one order of tea minimum per person, which is fine, since you can just add hot water and drink tea like a lunatic! I refilled until my tea was pretty much water.
Christine C.}Manhattan, NY}19}79}1}-1}5}11/12/2011}Love the ambiance. Sat at the bar area because the place was so packed on a Friday night. It was great though because I got to see the whole tea-making process! Only came here for tea, but would love to try its food/dessert in the future. This place is SO Authentic.Had the Mocha Latte. It was delicious! Lovely color, wonderful taste. Would definitely come back again!!
Caroline A.}Fairfax, VA}1132}1178}22}-1}5}11/7/2011Updatedreview}I hadn't been to Cha-An in about four years, and it was just as lovely as I remembered.  I had always come here for tea and dessert, and finally tried their food menu. And I loved it. Cha-An is one of the rare places where you can get real authentic Japanese food. I'm talking rice porridges, miso soups, tofu soups, pickled vegetables and fish cakes. Everything tastes fresh and clean - you can dine out guilt free! We did indulge in dessert and got the grapefruit puff pastry looking cake, as well as the banana chocolate ganache cake. Both were excellent!  Love this place. I wish we had something similar in Chicago.
Angela K.}New York, NY}461}868}188}-1}4}10/28/2011}Black sesame creme brulee and green tea truffles were both creamy and delicious, but were petite and did not feel heavy or over-indulgent. The place is cute and quiet, a great date spot or place to meet with parents or in laws. A little pricey for tea and dessert, but its a nice sit down setting.My friend ordered some Sake ice cream cocktail concoction.. it was a strange assortment, the jellies didn't go well in it and it was the only thing on the menu I wouldn't recommend.
Phil C.}West New York, NJ}440}84}0}-1}5}10/26/2011}Cha-An gets 5 stars for their great selections of teas, seriously delicious and original desserts, and impeccable service. I've been here a few times and honestly have nothing negative to rant about. I've never tried their actual entrees, but I've seen some dishes and they look great. I'll have to go back and order some. Also, it's an amazing date spot. The ambiance can be very romantic as you share a post meal conversation over tea and dessert. It never gets too noisy. This is quickly becoming a regular spot for me, especially now that F/W are rolling by.
Andrea H.}Cupertino, CA}209}81}5}-1}4}10/24/2011}We came here for dessert after we had dinner at Yakitori Taisho. The place was quite full at around 8 pm, but the 6 seats at the bar were empty. The lady waiter asked if we were just having dessert and not mind seating at the bar, so we took our seat and started poring over the menu. FYI: This place served dinner as well,  although the dinner menu is somewhat limited and consists of Japanese small dishes/tapas.I decided on the famous black sesame creme brulee and hubby settled on the sweet potato apple (seasonal). Both were around $8-9 each.I love my black sesame creme brulee. It was served (interestingly) on a Japanese stone tea cup. I was quite suprised because it came with a sesame ice cream on top of the creme brulee, and also sesame sweet cracker. The verdict is: it's a winner! Creamy smooth custard with strong sesame flavor and just the right level of sweetness. The sesame ice cream is also not too sweet. I am in dessert heaven!I tried a spoonful of hubby's sweet potato apple cake. Like my dessert,it wasn't too sweet, and it is a combination of ice cream, some sort of cracker, stewed apple slice, and cake. Marriage of sweet potato and apple flavor works well, but I prefer my black sesame creme brulee.I picked up a green tea cookie ($2) to go before we left. I will write a follow up review when I am finished with the cookie.All in all, it's a good Japanese dessert place (so lacking in California), we'll be back!
Jan Y.}Long Island City, NY}97}374}1307}-1}4}10/19/2011}I came here for Tea and deserts I expected a larger menu of deserts thinking it was just a desert place.  I tried to mochi and creme brulee both were very good. It turns out they do serve traditional Japanese food as well.  Set dinners that I'm anxious to try next time around.   Good place to catching up with friends drinking tea.
Queenie C.}Brooklyn, NY}2}34}12}-1}5}10/16/2011}Black sesame creme brûlée is my long time fav and never disappoints me. Tea and other desserts are also good. Cocktails are toward the sweet side. Black sesame cookie is my 2nd fav.
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}4}10/14/2011}Cute little Japanese tea shop/dessert shop. We went on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for 2.  The waitress was great about getting us hot water refills and making tea recommendations. The tea is expensive, but it certainly is unique and different than your average tea.  We ordered the Chefs dessert selection.  I can't remember all the specific little desserts but everything was tasty.  Next time I'll be back to try the Matcha!
Brooke W.}Winter Garden, FL}391}117}427}-1}4}10/13/2011}Went to Cha-An on a whim after getting some okonomiyaki next door. My boyfriend and I went for tea and dessert. You go upstairs and suddenly you are in Japan. The decor it very traditional and calming, but also very chic. They have a very extensive tea list as well as some very upscale food items and desserts. They have a daily creme brulee. It was Earl Grey  the day I went but we ended up getting something else. It took 5-10 min for a server to come and actually give us a menu to look at. But once we got our tea the service picked up. They offered us more hot water for our tea pot twice. Oh also there is an awesome electric Japanese toilet in the  girls bathroom. Love it! Overall Cha-An was a lovely experience. Domo Arigatou Gozaimasu!
Kelly R.}Houston, TX}66}609}144}18}5}10/11/2011}Cute little eatery place.  We only got bubble tea to-go.  I had a jasmine tea with tapioca.  It was made with real tea rather than them using a powder mix.  It's just the way I like it-pure deliciousness.
CiCi L.}New York, NY}532}111}43}-1}4}10/11/2011}Cha-An is a very special tea house, where the traditional tea ceremony is performed with great care and artistry. Upstairs is a little oasis from the busy streets, so the spiritual nature of the tea ceremony can be enjoyed.  Mr. Bon Yagi taught me about the ceremony.
Darnell S.}Piscataway Township, NJ}417}4}0}-1}4}10/10/2011}The Flower craft tea smells amazing. The taste is so beautiful and soothing you almost feel as if youre relaxing in a garden as opposed to drinking tea. We had these rice covered pork balls that were epically delish as well as the grilled salmon toast....which was good but nothing worth swooning over being that it was more bread than salmon or the lettuce on top. The real winner was the tri-mochy that we had for desert. Red soy,  chocolate, and green tea were the choices and boy was i beyond impressed when i tried it. The chocolate one was almost equivalent to a truffle! All in all it was a good place. Nice atmosphere simple straight forward waitresses. Definitely a nice place for a date and extra intimate. Im definitely coming back here again.
Lyn X.}San Francisco, CA}4}44}4}-1}4}10/6/2011}Nice ambiance, good service & awesome food. We went there for dessert the Souffle was fantastic, so was the Black sesame creme brule. Worth every penny :)
Jing Y.}Manhattan, NY}41}145}38}-1}5}9/25/2011}Very cute place to catch up with friends over intricately constructed desserts and pages upon pages of tea selection (Yum!)  As always, I'm biased towards anything green tea or sesame flavored, so if you are a die hard fan like me, this place is worth checking out!  They also have savory dishes available, but I think their desserts are their biggest draw.Things are a bit on the pricey side, so if you want to try more desserts, get just one or two pots of tea to share.  The servers are usually really accomodating if you want your tea refilled, etc, so take advantage!
Will L.}Brooklyn, NY}82}102}182}-1}4}9/24/2011}Relaxing environment. Initial service is slow but friendly. Once recognized by the waitress service got better. I ordered the food set and my wife ordered the dessert set. Some items are good. Some are average. their black sesame creme burlee is good~~ but I had a "red tea Flan~~~"~~ OMG!!! the BEST !!!! it was on their special dessert of the day~~~ i wanted to order one to bring home but unfortunately it was for there only. Please
Andrew C.}Brooklyn, NY}30}192}17}18}5}9/23/2011}Came here with a friend after work, around 6ish. Wasn't super busy yet, but it definitely became popular around 7-8ish, with people waiting outside. The place was kinda small. Cute, intimate, romantic. Not too loud, so you can listen to your company talk. I'm not sure what they feel about you studying there, but as long as you keep purchasing, it shouldn't be a problem. I wouldn't recommend parties larger than 6 to go together without reservation. I think they have maybe 1-2 private rooms if you do want your own space, but call ahead!The service is standard. They don't bother you so that you may enjoy your tea time, and go forth only if you call on them. The tea takes a while to prepare for awesomeness. I ordered the a tea set (tea + ice cream, macaroon, cookie, strawberry pudding, banana bread) & the mochis (choco, green tea, roasted beans).THE TEA IS GOOD. I think I had the hibiscus phoenix honey tea, which was perfectly balanced & sweet. I LOVED IT. The pot that they give you though, can probably fill 4-5 cups of tea. The dessert is not bad, small portions to tease you. Don't be silly if you're planning to come here to eat dinner, unless you eat really small amounts. Besides, the place is best for a relaxing night with tea anyway. PRICING is "somewhat" expensive. I find Cha-An to be a place to impress someone or for good occasions, and not somewhere to go as a regular. Cash only! Yes, I would come again if I'm there to impress or catch up with someone. Tea time is sweet and pleasant. Let your liver heal!
Christine S.}San Jose, CA}264}35}429}-1}5}9/20/2011}I decided to go here just to try their tea and dessert. I was seated immediately by a friendly waitress. I had the hibiscus tea which was served cold - very fruity and the perfect amount of sweetness. For dessert, I tried the sesame creme brulee and the Sakura Flan. Both were outstanding. The Sesame creme brulee was served in a cup with a scoop of ice cream. Even though I finished the desserts and the plates were taken away, they did not bring me the check. You have to ask for it because [I believe] they don't want to interrupt your "tea time."
Alexa P.}Manhattan, NY}226}12}3}-1}5}9/19/2011}Beautiful flavors and atmosphere. Cozy zen refuge in the east village.
Jeanie C.}Chicago, IL}42}215}3}-1}4}9/17/2011}Loved this place!! Totally zen-ful in every way! Huge selection of teas... and my favorite a blooming flower tea!! And they fill up your pot several times :) Totally blown away by the black sesame creme brulee! Wonderful and surprising mix of flavors.A peaceful haven for dessert and tea with friends :) Cute decor too! (They also have savory dinner food too) The place is small though, but we only had to wait 10 minutes or so on a Saturday night.
Cristy Y.}Flushing, NY}7}37}0}-1}5}9/14/2011}I was introduced to Cha-An last summer when I met up with a friend here. I'm glad for that, because this is a wonderful teahouse with great tea and food. Some of the food and drinks I've had here include the chef's dessert assortment (yogurt-flavored ice cream with a sesame cracker, green tea mousse cake and sakura flan, and soy bean macaron and green tea cookie), chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce, macarons (chocolate, green tea, and Earl Grey), matcha latte, jasmine pearl tea, and flower craft tea, all of which were good; my favorites were the green tea mousse, chocolate souffle, and Earl Grey macarons. The soy bean macaron's filling was too sweet, and the souffle's raspberry sauce was too sour, but another friend that I came here with liked it.I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quiet, intimate place to eat, drink, and chat.
Norry H.}Washington, DC}720}565}4565}18}5}9/12/2011}With the quality of food, service, atmosphere, Cha-an made my special occasion a perfect one.
Kimberly L.}South Slope, Brooklyn, NY}73}122}95}-1}5}9/9/2011Updatedreview}So I FINALLY made it back out to this place after almost a year and I am ecstatic that I did. They have some changes but the heart and soul of it remains unchanged. The place is still as quaint and cute as ever. And the servers are as well. They changed up the menu since I was last there and they now have savory food items. The only one I tried was the smoked salmon toast. It was pretty good. The smoked salmon was delicious as was the perfectly-crispy-crust-but-oh-so-soft-interior bread and greens. The only complaint I had about it was the mustard/mayo spread. The mustardy kick was perfect but I think mayo was mixed in because it had a fatty undertone to it. My boyfriend and I each got the chef's dessert selections which "paired" with the tea we ordered. I don't really know if the pairing really made a difference but we had fun trying each others desserts. We had macaroons, scones, ice cream, and some other yummy little treats. We actually sat at the bar for the first time and got to watch the women prepare the tea and the men in the back prepare the food. One thing I thought was really interesting was they took the temperature of the water before pouring it into the teapots. And all of them spoke Japanese which I thought was really cute and made the place even more authentic. All in all, I hope to be back more often.
Joey M.}Boston, MA}1}43}1}-1}5}9/9/2011}Always leave this place with an orgasm. Do not miss the black sesame creme brûlée.
Julia G.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}9/5/2011}Love this place. Delicious food and heavenly tea.
S R.}Queens, NY}4}15}0}-1}4}9/5/2011}Jadore! I love and adore this quaint little spot.  If it gets too popular, or if 'Gossip Girl' decides to make a visit, I'm screwed.  What I love about this place:- lovely teas- desserts that are light and sweet and not overdone- variety, (in everything, from the teas, to the food, to the sweets, and all wholesome)- Clean, comfortable facilities and decor. It's wonderful here. I love the ambiance. It can get loud because there are so many people that pack this place, but the service is very polite and it is just a place to sit and have tea. I mean really sit and enjoy your meal and your drink. Not too bright, with fresh flowers at every table, (and even the bathroom!).- you can sit as long as you like, they don't rush you. So be kind in return and don't over stay. They don't say anything, but other customers are waiting.Cons: Okay, there are a couple.  Because you can stay as long as you like they are often slow in bringing you the check.  Cash only.  There is an ATM around the corner near McDonalds, but most people in NYC are card carriers.All in all always a great experience.  They even offer cooking and baking classes as well as tea ceremonies. Inquire if you're interested :)
N L.}Bergen County, NJ}124}23}9}-1}5}9/3/2011}Walk up the narrow stairs. Push past those curtains and find yourself in JAPAN!!Cha-An was like a heaven when my friend and I needed shelter from the scorching sun outside. It's a part of the T.I.C Group Restaurants (Sobaya, Robotaya, Otafuku)  which is known for their authentic Japanese cuisines.Some of the waitresses are dressed in kimonos and there's even a private tea room you can rent for a Japanese tea ceremony.  We ordered a couple of desserts from the dessert menu. Our favorites were:Chai Latte- yum. The taste of chai is strong mixed in with a light milky latte. If you don't like chai tea, this might not be the best choice for you.Black sesame and sake ice cream- It was the first time I had these flavors and I loved them. The black sesame tasted similar to the Korean black sesame soy milk juice boxes. The sake ice cream was a vanilla ice cream flavor with a hint of a scent and taste of sake (Japanese rice wine). The crunchy sesame tuile rested on top of the ice cream was also exceptionally good.BTW HUGE TIP!!: GO INTO THEIR BATHROOM! It's so amazingly clean. The bathroom alone actually feels like I've been transported to Japan. 5 Stars because of the bathroom :) I really love the bathroom here..
Sh F.}Manhattan, NY}0}40}8}-1}5}9/3/2011}Their food is just great. You won't get sick of it even if you go there several times a week since the menu changes all the time. Not only regular dishes but also pastries and desserts are exceptional and original.I recommend lunch rice bowl + dessert, which comes with gen-mai-cha (brown rice tea), and cha-kago, which comes with a number of side dishes, soup, dessert, any kind of tea you like and refill free multi-grain rice.I must say, this is one of only few restaurants serving real Japanese foods, so many Japanese also go to Cha-an when they miss the taste of home.Another thing I like is they never rush customers, so we can take time and enjoy tea and meal.I wish they accept credit cards.
Xuefan Z.}New York, NY}36}30}0}-1}3}8/28/2011}We came here after lunch one day to kill some time, so we did not order any food other than mouchi and zenzai. We also had the jasmine pearl tea. From the images online, I imagined this place to be a very relaxed, cool, and large place where one could read a book, drink some tea, maybe even close one's eyes a bit on the chair. I believe they might have some space like that, maybe the lounge? although it costs like $40 dollars to reserve the lounge I think... When we went in at 2pm it was a bit packed... we sat at the bar because all the tables are taken.Mouchi was good. Green tea ones are def. better than the chocolate ones. Zenzai was a little disappointing. Now the tea... it was good tea, but it is not a drink some tea at your own pace place. The teapot is tiny... which holds maybe 3-4 small cups of tea. The first time they served my boyfriend and I each a cup (small), and took the teapot away.. and we were like thats it??... good thing is that after we were done, they brought it back! so yay, more tea for us. The problem is that maybe it takes a lot of time for the water to boil or for the tea to steam... We would always be waiting and waiting. We had two pots of tea over the course of maybe an hr.. it is a small pot and we had two people. So this was a bit disappointing, as drinking tea should be a relaxed experience, not so much full of anticipation :(....We were sitting at the bar, we didn't read although we both had books, it was too awkward with the staff standing there and eating their lunch at the same bar, we waited for our tea and left...It was pricy too... I guess it wasn't bad, just didn't fulfill any expectation whatsoever.. Oh no credit card accepted.
Will C.}Queens, NY}2348}609}505}18}3}8/26/2011}Interesting place to stop for some neo-interpretations of Japanese tea ceremonies. You can order different tea sets and food, but it can be communal as everyone is trying each other's sets only to be interrupted every so often by the next course. Black sesame creme brulee and the noodles were the best dishes.
Susan L.}Brooklyn, NY}8}59}31}-1}4}8/22/2011}First time I came here was on a saturday around 3pm. The place was packed and my party of 3 waited at least 15minutes for a seat but that was fine because the server acknowledged our presence and took down our name. I ordered the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and it was so good. It was too sweet which was exactly how I liked my desserts. There's also a scoop of black sesame ice cream on top and a black sesame cracker/wafer on top of that. Service was quick and nice.Now for the second time. I came back today (monday) around 3pm and the place was almost full. Even though it wasn't as busy as saturday it took awhile for the server to even realize I was standing there. After me and my bf sat down it took a long time for them to get the order, for us to receive our food, for our dessert to come, and for our tea to be refilled. They didn't even give us the lunch menu.Food: We both ordered the Cha-Koga meal ($22) which comes with soymilk quiche w/ mushrooms and scallions, the day's soup, two side dishes, tea smoked salmon, rice, chef's dessert, and your choice of tea (except for matcha, tieguanyin, and dong ding oolong tea). Soymilk quiche was my favorite dish out of this meal other than the dessert. The texture was very smooth and even though this is a tea-house the specializes in tea and desserts, this was a very well executed dish.Two side dishes was sauteed vegetables and an octopus and long bean salad. Didn't think much of the vegetables but the octopus salad was decent. I liked the peanut sauce that it was mixed with. Unlike other peanut sauces this wasn't very sweet at all which complimented the octopus.Today's soup was a vegetable miso soup which tasted like a non-spicy version of a chinese soup called "law song tong" in cantonese.Tea smoked salmon wasn't what I expected and the sauce they put on top of it was very strong tasting. I don't think it paired well with the salmon.For dessert I got the sakura flan. I'm craving this right now! The texture is so much smoother than latin american flan. It had a mildly sweet taste that won't make you feel like you have to jog a mile to work off what you ate. I wanted to order this last time but it was sold out (which must mean it's very good) so thankfully I got to try it this time.
Stephen D.}Bergen County, NJ}213}571}175}-1}5}8/22/2011}Came here after seeing Fuerza Bruta on 15th & Union Square. The place is small with a 6-8 person seated bar. the seats are comfortable, the noise level is low, and music is relaxing. The restaurant itself smells great, the mixture of fresh teas, fresh baked goods and everything else. I love small, authentic, comfortable places. This place feels authentic, you would (i assume) you were in downtown Tokyo and not NYC; so it's something to be appreciated.It was around 10pm and the restaurant was about 90% full. Mostly people eating dessert and drinking tea. They serve sake and beer as well as non alcoholic beveragesThe food is awesomely tasty! the entrees are served in sets, the prices are dependent on the amount of sides or accompaniments that come with each set. You just pick a set and the cheery server asks if you are allergic to anything, and 15-20 minutes later your food arrives. My set came with 2 pickled toppings, smoked salmon topping, salted tiny fish, a bowl of rice with cold bonito broth, and fried squid in a warm broth.  It was all so delicious and not overly filling. IT al looked and tasted home made, nothing seemed processed. The lady ordered some seasoned rice and pickles and we picked from each other's plates.We also ordered the home made scones which are made to order!! 15 minutes after you order, you get this small plate of delicious moist light scones. My set came with a coffee cream-puff, which was light and fresh, the coffee cream was rich but not too sweet.Would definitely come back again, great place for a snack and for dinner or even Brunch. The ambiance is awesome, the service is extremely friendly but maybe slightly slow at times. But this is type of place you come to, to relax, enjoy some conversation, eat slowly and take it all in; So be patient
Jennifer L.}Oakland, CA}57}64}21}-1}5}8/16/2011}I love this place! I fell in love with its decor, and their menu is so darling. I love their meal sets. And their soymilk quiche is to die for. I love how they set up your meal and all the little trays and utensils. Oh my god I love this place so much. Their food is always interesting, and there are so many things in the meal set that even if you don't like one thing, there are 5 other things to like. And their desert, which the chef chooses for you according to the tea your ordered, is always good. Everything here is wonderful. If you love food, tea, and cute details, this is definitely a must try. I love it!
Stella S.}Woodside, NY}154}433}21}-1}5}8/15/2011}I finally got here after I heard too much about it from one person (just sayin, not complainin)In a day where the rain didnt stop, and on our third food stop for the day, we ended up here. Im not a huge tea fanatic, but their scones are spot on and baked to order.what? yes. baked to order. i was even told to wait for the scone to cool down a bit before forking it.hot tea and fresh baked scones makes rainy days perfect. Who says you have to stay home on a rainy day?
Erika C.}San Francisco, CA}268}925}3177}-1}5}8/13/2011}This place was awesome.  I still think about the bacon and veggie soup (so, so, SO good) and the sugar cookie served with a slice of peach and what tasted like hand-whipped cream.  The cookie was so simple, but really good.I also had three other dishes that were good with my lunch set, but I can't remember what they were, so while good, they're not memorable.Love the decor... great place to slow down and unwind.
Nicolas F.}Manhattan, NY}0}11}1}-1}4}8/10/2011}Great authentic Japanese ambiance, great food, not a typical sushi place, come here for new flavors and to try new things, for a good price.
Kristal F.}Manhattan, NY}46}60}13}-1}4}8/3/2011}This place is super sweet. Very cozy and quaint. The food and tea are yummy. Had all of their tea and app sets.  Everything was delicate looking but had plenty of flavor. Service was good. Excellent date place. Do go on a week day and don't go after 3 on sat.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}5}7/31/2011}Afternoon Tea Set: comes with two sandwiches, scones, muffins, macaron and your choice of tea. Both sandwiches were tiny but absolutely delicious! I liked the one with jam a little better than the one with salmon. Scones were also very good but I didn't like muffins and macaron as much. I got hojicha for the tea and It had a less bitter but deeper taste than regular green tea. Zenzai: sake ice cream is so unique and delicious! This is definitely my favorite item from this place.Matcha Float: ice matcha latte with red bean paste and jelly. It's a must for all the matchaholics like me. I think they only have it during the summer though.What makes this place amazing is not just its food and dessert but also its environment. It is quiet and cozy, and the decor is very cute and Japanese. It's a great place to go with a small group friends and chat over super awesome desserts for a few hours.
Sam J.}Berkeley, CA}8}154}52}-1}5}7/31/2011}Been there twice:Black Sesame Creame Brulee: It's amazing how they used black sesame in the creame brulee  itself, plus the surprise black sesame ice cream and black sesame candy wafer. Great contrast of textures and temperatures.Cha-An Sweet - a platter of five types of baked goods: macaroon, cookie type thing, cupcake type thing, pound cake, scone (w/ jam + cream). Really good, my favorites were the scone and macaroon.Chrysanthemum Blossom herbal tea - I'm not really a tea connoisseur, but this was great. I did appreciate the presentation, where it was served in an amazing glass pot. You can see the tea blossom as it absorbed water.Earl Grey Tea Flan - Normally when things are made of earl grey flavor, it's pretty subtle. Not this; the tea flavor was front and center, the way I like it!
Alex Y.}Little Neck, NY}17}9}6}-1}5}7/30/2011}This to be my favorite tea houses in the city. The décor is really very well done, very japanese, which is not so surprising since all the waitresses are japanese and the place is located on japan row. The setting is relatively quite, and the lighting is a bit dim but warm which makes it a good spot for a lunch date. In fact, I sat next to this girl who was on a lunch date from hell. The guy just wouldnt shut up and she was trying so hard to make a run for the exit, but couldn't...think she finally faked a phone call in order to leave... Anyway! since the space is rather small, get there early to avoid a wait. Since seating is limited, it's not really good for large groups, but for a group of 4 or 6 its perfect, but make sure to call a head or drop by to see if they can reserve a table for you. The selections of teas is rather extensive and can be a bit tricky to navigate since there are so many options to choose from, but never be afraid to ask for advice from the waiting staff. My personal favorites are the Tieguanyin (gungfu style) and the Jasmine Pearls. *order the Tiequanyin (gungfu style) if you want to see a tea demonstration. The scones here are a must! They are hot out of the oven and incredibly moist. Good to the last crumb. Their lunch specials, desserts, and tea sets are definitely something worth checking out. The servers here are incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable. Occasionally you find one or two of them wearing kimono's which makes the experience all the more authentic. One thing to keep in mind before coming here is that it is cash, and while it isn't as pricey as some of the other tea houses in the city, you want to make sure you have at least $30 with you, just in case. I keep finding myself coming back to this place over and over again. It's definitely a must visit if you're looking for something new and interesting.
Ming H.}Manhattan, NY}29}37}0}-1}5}7/29/2011}Very nice price and excellent service =] kind of romantic settings, good was ok, great green tea.
Baking M.}Boston, MA}30}81}10}-1}5}7/29/2011}Cha-An is an amazing establishment. Serene, zen tea drinking and Japanese treats and tea sets. The afternoon tea set with scones and bagels looked fantastic.The staff wear kimonos and are well versed in educating patrons on the process of drinking various teas.Green tea roll with sake ice cream (so unique) and a tuile.Cha-An has an extensive selection of black, green, oolong, white and herbal tea from various Asian origins.The women's bathroom had a proper Japanese Toto toilet!
Michelle W.}New York, NY}520}1128}48}18}5}7/25/2011Updatedreview}Super authentic! The service, quality and authenticity has not changed since the last time I came here and it's always an experience visiting Cha-An. I had the dessert sampler. The Matcha Float was delicious and if you love green tea, this is the real deal. The sampler was perfect for two. Although I definitely could have eaten the entire thing myself, it hit the spot and made for a great snack.If you like Kyotofu, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.
Dennis J.}New York, NY}13}743}33}18}4}7/24/2011}Nice place to come in and sit, relax, and enjoy desserts and drinks. Service was nice and helpful, and the food was pretty good. I didn't enjoy the black sesame creme brulee all that much, but I would come back for the ambiance and to try some of the other food.
ally l.}CANAL STREET, NY}0}8}0}-1}5}7/21/2011}Cha-An is definitely a spot for light eaters or snackers with a sweet tooth. There dessert are so cute and tasty. The teas are excellent.It's a quiet tea house and I felt so relaxed there. The service is good there as well.FIVE STAR =]
Eva W.}San Francisco, CA}529}368}11}18}4}7/20/2011}This place is adorable. Attentive service, but remember it's cash only.Great place for tea and good snacks. Tried each of the iced tea drinks: matcha and sencha was good, lavendar was decent, and not the biggest fan of hojichaAnd I LOVE their black sesame ice cream.
Chris L.}New York, NY}32}123}1}-1}5}7/18/2011}Adorable, affordable, and legit.  Once again, I'm the only white guy in the room- ah, that takes me back to my time at Stony Brook University.
Mary F.}Brooklyn, NY}104}452}935}-1}4}7/13/2011}Cha-An is basically a tea and dessert bar so you must get at least one of each of those. I love how much different types of tea they  have. It's not that expensive for their dishes but it does add up pretty quickly. I like this place more than Spot Dessert Bar and I had it in the same day so yea.Things I ordered that were memorable:- Chef's Dessert Assortment-- fairly small but they were all very good- Chocolate Souffle-- yummy...i love souffles--you gotta break it apart and let the sauce go all the way down =P- Black Sesame Crème Brulee-- not a fan of creme brulee so i stole my friend black seasame cracker, which stuck to my teeth- Ice cream is awesome!!!
C. N.}Geneva, Switzerland}1}19}23}-1}4}7/9/2011}Been here at least 5 times, chiefly for desserts, a lovely place to hang out after a good meal but remember: CASH ONLY! which i almost always forgot, oopsFood (3.5/5) a little star dish in the cha-an set is the soy milk quiche, rich in flavours, whereas the rest of the dishes are heavy in salt, salmon overcooked and the vegetable soup rather unsoft. Yet a 4/5 rating is applicable to their desserts and the warm matcha latte, try the assorted and seasonal specials such as sakura flan. Tea is served in beautiful and simple teawares, somewhat overpriced, the seemingly great variety is however always marred by the many "out of stock" stickers )Ambience (4.5/5) elegant in a cute way, including its nameService (4/5) friendly servers always attentive to your requests or questions
Mar C.}Manhattan, NY}66}152}10}-1}5}7/8/2011}Go for the lunch special and feel free to order extra desserts. You will not regret it. It's amazing food. Not huge portions but it's clean, well prepared, authentic Japanese food that makes you feel good after you eat it. Oh and I dream about this place in my sleep. :)
Lucy X.}Washington, DC}56}226}302}-1}3}7/6/2011}This place is so cute. Traditional Japanese setting with cute little hut seating and cute little decorations. It's dimly lit and perfect setting for a nice dessert date. The sesame icecream creme brulee was disappointing. After trying two different Japanese style creme brulee at two different Japanese dessert places, I realized that if I want creme brulee, I should just stick to the original kind of creme brulee served at non-Japanese restaurants. Unfortunately, the Japanese style creme brulee is no where as good as it sounds.The chocolate mochi consisted of a thick ball of strong-tasting chocolate covered by a thin layer of mochi. It wasn't bad, unless you're not a fan of chocolate, then you'd probably hate it. My favorite dessert out of all was the green tea roll cake with sake? icecream, which tasted more like red bean icecream to me? The roll cake was soft and fluffy and generously stuffed with whipped green tea cream. Even though it was my favorite out of the rest, I wasn't completely crazy about it since I felt like I could find something very similar at any old Asian style bakery.Although everything was so aesthetically pleasing, like it usually is at Japanese places, the satisfaction just wasn't there. Not to mention, how damn SLOW the service was :(
Christal Y.}San Francisco, CA}77}179}63}-1}3}7/1/2011}OKAY THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.... for what it's worth, the food has such small portions and everything is either too sweet and lacking in strength of flavour. It's good but not $$ good. I got the matcha latte (with red beans at the bottom) and the sesame creme brulee. The sesame creme brulee was quiet good, but very sweet; however the balance between the sesame and the creme brulee is a good mix. Like I said though, it's way too sweet for the portion. I would prefer it to be doubled up and less sweet... The matcha latte was so watery. I've had stronger, thicker flavoured matcha from Starbucks - another great place in LA had so amazing flavoured matcha. The one from Cha'An tasted as if they mixed the powder with 1% milk, and so it lacked a kind of rich matcha taste. And unfortunately the red beans at the bottom - were a good idea - but didn't add a strong sweetness. Just ... red beans. yuck.However the atmosphere is part of what you pay for. It's a very traditional atmosphere without making non-Asians feel awkward. It's also a very cute place to bring a date or have one-on-one with a friend. I'm dying to try the green tea cakes and mochi because those are my die-for foods. I would come here again for a special occasion. However I'm still irritated that it costs so much... and is cash only??
April Joy C.}Brooklyn, NY}359}69}161}-1}4}7/1/2011}Great for a date or catching up with a friend over some tea and not too sweet desserts.  Cha-An is conveniently located near a few of my favorite spots in the east village.  Though never itching to go there I've found myself sitting down at one of its little tables more often then I would have thought in the last few months.  The macha latte is definitely worth trying and the sakura flan and black sesame creme brulee deserve a taste.  The place is cash only so just be prepared in advance.
Hannah K.}Manhattan, NY}3}9}3}-1}5}6/17/2011}This is absolutely the cutest Japanese restaurant ever. I came here only for tea and desert, but I will definitely be back here for a meal again.Everything is delicately served, everything tastes great, and there are so many choices to choose from in the menu. Also, The interior is also very beautiful. Great place for a date night as well as lunching with the girls.
Etta Y.}New York, NY}39}41}0}-1}5}6/12/2011}It's easy to dismiss this place as just a cafe, but their savory offerings are really tasty too. Limited menu so definitely one for fans of real Japanese food (no substitutions). I do wonder what is up with the waitresses' anime voices but service is competent. (I'm allowed to say that. I'm from Tokyo.)
Masha P.}New York, NY}5}15}0}-1}4}6/11/2011}One of my favorite places to catch up with an old friend, this cute Japanese tea house, despite being busy most of the time, never tries to rush you out the door after you've finished your food. I recommend getting the Chef's Dessert Assortments which consists of mini servings of various items on their dessert menu along with a tea of your choice. Some stand-outs among the desserts are the black sesame creme brulee and chocolate mochi. If you order the tea "Gung Fu" style (only some have this as an option) you get a whole tea set complete with tea ceremony instructions from your server. Another advantage of the Gung Fu style tea is the unlimited hot water refills you can use to steep your tea leaves, making Cha-An's above-average bathrooms another thing to appreciate.
Lev P.}Brooklyn, NY}384}7}0}-1}5}6/8/2011}One of my favorite places to go in the fall and winter. UPSIDES...The matcha latte, though one of the more syrupy things you can get there, has of the best flavor results where the milk and matcha works together very well... also the read beans on the bottom are nice touch. All the teas are great in taste and certain ones have a whole presentation factor with the little tea table and such. Helped me discover new Tea to drink.Want a Japanese Tea Ceremony? 15 bucks cash per person (Max people: 4). Reserve several days or a week in advance and you're done.Homemade Matcha/Chocolate cookies $6 per 6 small sized ones.Friendly and attentive staff.Fully automated Toto Toilet in women's restroom, you lucky ladies.Two Small Downsides:Cash only = :(Have to wait for a table when they're busy for about 20 mins (Weekend Evenings mostly).. but hey, it's a small place and quite popular so nothing can really be done there.
Leslie T.}New York, NY}79}49}160}-1}5}6/5/2011}Try the Black sesame creme brulee!! Oh, and the sake-infused cocktails when they're out.
Audrey K.}New York, NY}293}376}559}-1}3}5/31/2011}I like this place, duh - as everyone does. It's quaint, it's good and clean tasting treats, and it makes you want to sit up straight. The staff as so sweet, and sometimes you and they need to repeat things a few times, but they are always smiling at you.The desserts (I've only tried the desserts) are so very yum... and don't make you feel guilty - this is probably wrong, but that's okay.  Their teas are yum, and fun, and their martinis are strong and coldcoldcold. It's something new, and you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.I would go back, but it's not somewhere I am itching to return to. If a friend out of town wanted to go to a cute spot, Cha-An would definitely pop into mind.
Kassy M.}San Diego, CA}260}1352}639}-1}5}5/20/2011Updatedreview}I came here with a couple friends last week and Cha-An hit the spot yet again. You know you're at an amazing place when you can easily kill two hours just eating dessert and drinking tea.Between the 3 of us, we got:- 1 ice cream: 2 scoops (green tea & black sesame)- 2 Chef's Dessert AssortmentsThe ice cream was delicious. Green tea ice cream is my absolute favorite and it's really tasty at Cha-An. I didn't know what to expect of the black sesame ice cream but I thought it tasted like vanilla bean...I loved it!The Chef's Dessert Assortments blew me away. It's a 3-course dessert! The very first dessert dish you get is your choice of ice cream...I can't remember the choices they have and what we chose but they were both yummy of course. It comes with a crispy, sweetened sesame cracker type thing which goes really well with the ice cream.I cannot remember the second and third course we got...all I remember is that it's worth the money ($17 for the 3-course dessert & tea), and I highly recommend it if you are splitting it with someone because that's a lot of sweetness!The coolest thing about the 3-course dessert is that it comes with your choice of tea. Not only that, but depending on the tea you choose, your second course of dessert will be different. The chef will make you the dessert that best compliments your tea. So awesome! The two types of tea we chose were:- Genmaicha- Flower Craft TeaI have had the genmaicha before, as my parents used to drink it a lot when I was growing up. Loose leaf tea is just so delicious! The flower craft tea blew my mind. They put these two flowers in the glass bowl that look like dark colored peanuts...and slowly they open up in the hot water and it's just incredible. It tasted amazing and I thought the dessert the chef made to accompany the tea was just perfect. They give you an unlimited supply of hot water for the tea, so you can share it with a bunch of people!
Hauwei L.}Chicago, IL}111}118}0}-1}5}5/20/2011}Very classy, traditional-looking 2nd floor tea house. Wide selection of drinks and food. Great place to chat with friends. Paid about $8 for tea, multiple refills, which seems pretty reasonable for NYC. Didn't try the food (we went after dinner), but other tables' food looked good, would like to try some time!
Anqi Y.}Glendale, NY}32}13}19}-1}5}5/15/2011}Love this place. Japanese style decoration. Great tea and dessert. I had the flower tea and the flower opened slowly in hot water. And the black sesame creme brulee is super tasty!
Eli F.}New York, NY}20}15}0}-1}5}5/15/2011}This is my favorite cafe in New York. Some of the dishes (and especially the tea) are a little pricey, but literally everything is a new world of delicious. From the smoked salmon toast, to all of the deserts and teas, you'll love everything. In addition to how delicious the food is, the ambiance is amazing too. It's a pretty small and cozy place, and feels like its a different world from outside. The environment is extremely relaxing, and the music is great as well. All in all, if you like tea, delicious food, and a relaxing atmosphere, you'll love this place.
Ayaka N.}Philadelphia, PA}2}3}0}-1}5}5/14/2011}This is by far my favorite café in Manhattan. I love everything about this place: the ambiance, the dessert, the meals, and of course, the tea. It's the kind of place where you can bring your favorite book or your treasured notebook and pen, and just think.I honestly don't want too many people to know about this place, but everyone deserves to try it. :)This place seems to be very popular in the late evening (especially after dinner time), so if you are looking for immediate seating, I suggest coming here mid-afternoon on a weekday.
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}4}5/10/2011Updatedreview}I came here for dessert after our Vandaag dinner. It's still a solid 4 star dessert destination but I thought a more thorough review was in order. According to my friend when she tried to come to this place before they were ignored and made to wait until they finally decided to leave. I've never had a bad experience though and last Friday we only had to wait about 10 minutes. My companions ordered the matcha latte and the display tea while I opted for a classic jasmine tea. For dessert we all shared the following: green tea and chocolate mochi, assortment of sweets (scone, muffin, pound cake, cookie, Earl Grey macaron) and the 3 course dessert (green tea ice cream, black sesame creme brûlée and matcha cream puff, green tea macaron and biscotti. The teas were excellent of course and for the sweets the top contenders were the black sesame creme brûlée, the green tea ice cream, and the macarons. The Earl Grey macaron in particular was one of the best macarons I've had!I've always loved the setting here. Very quaint and a great hidden spot. Keep in mind it's cash only.
Catherine T.}Manhattan, NY}12}208}182}-1}4}5/4/2011}Before launching into excruciating detail I'm just going to say that I think this place is adorable, quiet, and lovely and the food is good but a bit too soft. OK...now for the excruciating detail.I was here very early (2-4pm) and it was raining so there weren't a lot of other customers. I can't say how it would be on a normal day but I found it very pleasant. There's a bit of bustle from the kitchen but otherwise it feels like a little haven away from the world, with old-fashioned jazz shimmering through the air. They had me from the moment I recognized Ella Fitzgerald's version of "A Tisket, A Tasket".I opted for the jasmine pearls...a good staple tea. It was lovely good quality jasmine. They're good about adding more hot water when the notice that you're out but if the waitress isn't moving about the dining area then it's a bit hard to get her attention. The teapot is very small so each pot is just a little more than a cup of tea (see picture).I chose to get the afternoon tea set so I'd get the best idea what a tea experience here is like. The strawberry bagel was very yummy. To me, the bread was more pretzel-like (traditional soft pretzel like from a street vendor) than bagel-like but I didn't mind because both are delicious. The heat from the bagel melted the strawberry filling and caused it to ooze and drip from the center making it very messy to try and eat. The strawberry is some kind of cream that reminds me of strawberry pocky. The salmon bagel also had the pretzel-like bread. There was some sour flavor, some onion in the spread, and some herbs. It was a surprisingly complex mix of flavors and textures. The salmon was very light and smooth. It didn't have that strong, artificial salmon flavor at all (which was nice) but I found it getting a little overwhelmed by the other components. These two come out at first. (see picture)Then, they bring out a long rectangular tray with all the sweets. (see picture). The corn muffin is amazingly good. I was expecting dry cornbread. I got little corn kernels embedded in a super moist cake, with the sweet-corn taste you get from certain Chinese porridge/congee deserts. It's served warm and melts in your mouth. The green tea pound cake is served cold and is very meh. A sort of muted jade color, it is too soft and crumbles at the slightest touch. There's a nice light green tea flavor so you don't have to be afraid you're going to be overwhelmed if you don't like green tea but that leaves it also feeling a little bland. The mint chocolate macaron is very soft and moist as well. The shell crumbles nicely but it's so soft that it comes across more like a pillow mint than a macaron. Also, the flavor isn't much of a "wow" as far as macarons go. The scones are encrusted with rock sugar crystals on the outside. They are also very soft and moist but they have a nice crunchy crust to counterbalance the softness and the sugar also adds some nice texture. One is a bit savory from what I think is salt and caraway seeds. I fell in love with this one. It reminded me of making Irish scones and soda bread. The sweet one had chocolate which I found overpowering and unpleasant. Also, I had reached my limit by this point and couldn't manage to finish it.The service is very friendly and helpful. Feel free to ask questions or ask for recommendations. You can also purchase tea to take home for yourself or as a gift but personally, I'd just go to Ten Ren or somewhere cheaper. The lighting is a bit dim which I suppose could be construed as romantic but I would feel awkward having a date here unless more people were around.Cash only. Restrooms down the hall beside the kitchens. Impressively and frighteningly high tech. The tables are small and I suppose for groups they could be pushed together but I wouldn't bring more than a few people in a group.
Lucius K.}New York, NY}87}58}0}-1}5}5/1/2011}Great selection of teas, brewed perfectly, as well as sweets to pair with the tea. They even have Matcha, prepared with a bamboo whisk. Also, they serve a variety of lunch specials such as udon and donburi, which varies by the day of the week. The place feels like an cozy teahouse, and they even have a private tearoom that you can rent. They also do the Japanese tea ceremony at a certain time of day.
Alice W.}Durham, NC}139}187}3}-1}4}5/1/2011}VERY CUTE decor.  very cute date placegreen tea roll with sake ice cream:  The sake ice cream was good but it wasn't exceptional.  The green tea roll was slightly bland; it could definitely use more green tea flavorblack sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream:  very good, the crystalized sugar topping added great texture, the creme part of the creme brulee didn't have the thicker custard consistency a lot of other creme brulee's have.  It was much more watery, but still creamy.  Kind of expensive for dessert.  2 desserts came out to be around $22 including tax and tip.Also, CASH ONLY.
Espen A.}Oslo, Norway}17}11}6}-1}5}4/28/2011}If you want wonderful japanese tea this is the place to go. Also serves up some nice desserts - try the mochi green tea or chocolate ice cream. I also bought a nice japanese tea pot (tetchubin) which I really love.
Marlon A.}Manhattan, NY}115}239}337}-1}3}4/28/2011}We had a couple of savory dishes and the chef's tasting menu for dessert. With the savory we had Genmaicha -- a subtle Japanese green tea with brown rice. Then we had a full-bodied Sencha with dessert. Both teas were excellent. The appetizer savory sampler consists of six tea cup sized portions of pork, salmon, chicken, shrimp, lotus root, and bean sprouts. They were all delicious, especially the lotus roots which had a surprising amount of crunch. I was not impressed with the dessert chef's tasting though and it was actually the main reason for our visit. It came in three courses: a berry ice cream starter garnished with a toasted rice wafer, a tofu and roll cake middle course, and final course consisting of a cookie and chocolate-filled macaron. The tofu was creamier, sweeter and thicker consistency than I would have liked and the roll cake was only slightly cold -- it should have been colder. Overall though it was a pleasant experience and I recommend it especially if you are looking for a quiet oasis in the city. I would come back more for the tea than for the food.
Vivien T.}New York, NY}55}8}0}-1}4}4/20/2011}its cute... i like the ambience and everything.. the sesame creme brulee.. was alright.... it didn't knock my socks off... but dont come here if you have an empty stomach and expect to be filled... cuz you won't be...  i really like the green tea my friend had.... i forgot what its called... the waitress was extremely helpful... a bit pricey... but yeaa... i think you're paying for the atmosphere more than anything... i would come here again to try the limited lunch specials... cuz they ran out on that particular afternoon i went..
Siv L.}San Francisco, CA}189}821}44}18}5}4/18/2011}Came here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend on one of our very first dates. The place was fairly packed and they sat us in the little 2 person bamboo-type bench so we had a view of pretty much the entire teahouse -- made me feel as if we were sitting in a big stationary swing in someone's Japanese garden. The service was SUPER friendly and attentive. The decor was so cute. I ordered a pot of the Yinzhen Silver needle (white tea) and my boyfriend ordered one of the blooming teas (can't remember which one). We also split an order of the green tea and chocolate mochi (2 were green tea, one was chocolate). This was my first time having mochi and it was so yummy with the tea! We stayed and enjoyed our tea and talked for maybe 2 hours... I think we had the best seat in the house!Everything was great about Cha-An and I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves tea.
Tracy W.}New York, NY}113}119}243}-1}4}4/17/2011}Adorable place. Drinks and tea is kind of pricey. I come here only for their desserts. YUM x 10. I love their black sesame creme brulee- comes with ice cream and a black sesame cookie. The green tea roll with your choice ice cream was delicioso! Mixed berry ice cream, thumbs up. One of my favorite dessert places because it's not too heavy but still sweet enough.
Heidi S.}Marlboro, NJ}1}6}7}-1}4}4/16/2011}An interesting Japanese tea house, which serves light food (lunch and dinner) along with adult beverages, but their focus is offering modern Japanese desserts and a wide array of tea options for folks interested on anything beyond your typical Lipton tea bags or the Iced tea.If you are in or around East Village, give this place a try. Not a bad choice for a place to meet before or after dinner.By the way, does anyone know the purpose of the tiny room on top of the stair/staircase?
Tony L.}San Francisco, CA}710}1265}21}-1}4}4/15/2011}I'm a little torn in writing this review. On the one hand, the desert sampler we tried was pretty good. Greet tea short bread cookie. Black sesame creme brulee. Kumquat ice cream. A few other goodies. Yes, it was all good. But it was also hella expensive.I suppose I could flip this review around. On a rainy weekday afternoon, I came here with my girlfriend. I took a sip of her jasmine mint tea. Pure. Like the last whisper of winter on my warm palate. Unexpectedly, the owner of Cha-An was giving a video TV interview, camera crew and all. He spoke about concerns of importing foods from Japan given the nuclear disaster.It's crazy out there, out in the street, out in the world. To savor a few morsels of fine desserts, breaking cookies with my hands while the world crumbles outside. Sweetness and chaos. Sickness and respite. Sometimes you actually get a chance to reflect in a place, like a teahouse, that's meant for reflection. And somehow it's still ironic.
Doriancita X.}Los Angeles, CA}86}180}454}-1}4}4/12/2011}I came to Cha-An after dinner, craving for some tea and desert. The place is upstairs and still had a line at around 9:30pm. Clearly a late night sober option to hang out. It's very nice and quiet, and somewhat zen until you see a hipster that's dressed with obnoxious clothing that un-zens everything.The meals looked very expensive but super yummy. They have this little menu of cute deserts and all sorts of teas/ explanation on where the tea is originated from, what kind of health function is does which I thought was pretty cool. Definitely somewhat romantic, sober, cozy and warm.
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}4}4/10/2011Updatedreview}:) Not to mention that I had a not-so-good 1st date once here before I still really like to come here with my friends. Cha-An is definitely a hidden gem located upstairs on 9th st. I really love their Japanese serene decor inspired by an authentic tea house...so cute, which makes me feel cute ;pAnyhow...I love their dessert tasting menu and also their different set lunches and dinner sets...perfect meal with tea pairings. Yummy!
Dwight D.}Staten Island, NY}37}13}10}-1}4}4/9/2011}Cha An is a great place to try authentic Japanese teas paired with unique desserts. You're better off making reservationsas it's a small space that fills up fast. if you do make reservations, they mandate that you have dinner. So you can't just make reservations for tea.
Janice L.}Los Angeles, CA}101}499}629}18}5}4/3/2011}I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE CHA-ANSesame creme brulee. If you love sesame, you'll love sesame creme brulee. It's so full of rich sesame taste you'll feel like your mouth just went to sesame heaven. Green tea sponge cake is alright. Sesame ice cream is amazingggzinggzing! Also, their red bean matcha is delicious, a must try!Great dessert, good for afternoon tea. This place is so cute and the tea is good. Their tea menu is like a tiny dictionary. Definitely drop by if you're at the area!!PS it gets packed at night
Peter C.}New York, NY}2}19}0}-1}4}3/30/2011}Yay! I'm a fan.   Superb green tea and delicately flavored food (albeit not much choice for lunch).  A very chilled Japanese experience. Definitely the kind of place I'd return to with friends/family.   Incidentally for more substantial Japanese dining, I'm liking Zenkichi in Williamburg as my current preferred Japanese food place.
Angie K.}Singapore, Singapore}1254}427}263}-1}4}3/29/2011}Cha-An's a charming little tea house in the heart of St. Marks. Loved the cozy and intimate atmosphere. Our party of four came on a Monday evening and were seated immediately. We were served promptly, and we all had an overall enjoyable experience at Cha-An.With that said, I don't know what to rate on the food. it's dessert. Dessert always tastes good. So I kind of expected this "IT" place to offer AMAZING sweets because of all the hype. But it was okay. It was good, but it was paralleled to every other dessert places I've tried. Come here without expectations, and you'll have a great experience.
Kristen Q.}Palms, Los Angeles, CA}212}714}1423}18}4}3/28/2011}Come here for the happy hour specials- Sunday unagi hitsumabushi don $10it's a meal which comes with unagi over rice, Asian pickles, and select teas. Overall, good, not great.Cha-Ans Sweets cookies, scone, pound cake & more, your choice of tea $17: also, this set of desserts is good, but not great. But I think it's because I prefer tofu, cake desserts over cookies. For cookies, I just like your own home-baked soft cookies. I enjoyed the pound cake!Sencha Green Tea $7: Wow, what high grade quality tea (but it better be for $7) --- I had a headache before I came in but after drinking this tea, it went away. Of course, that and the very relaxing environment of this place. I do wish the tables were a little farther away from each other but still, this place is a nice retreat away from the loud hustle bustle of the city and a stark contrast from the loud tea shops such as Ten Ren or St. Alps, Manhattan.
Charlotte G.}Manhattan, NY}5}29}0}-1}3}3/28/2011}I wanted to adore this tea house and at first i did. Beautiful decor, very inviting and welcoming. I am a tea fan always on the lookout for great tea salons.I was there recently and enjoyed what the soup and tea i had.The server was a bit weird with me though, just a very strange attitude of super fake smiling and when after waiting for my soup for 15 minutes she came and asked if i wanted to order something else (the soup had not arrived yet), i said i'd like a glass of water while waiting, she returned to the open kitchen station and simply did other things than bring me water, among others, talking to other waitresses and unloading the dishwasher.The soup eventually came, with a glass of water.After i finished my soup she came to ask me if the food was good.... maybe she could have asked before i finished, otherwise, i don't see the point of asking...I'll try them again for their apparently special deserts.
Deborah Y.}La Canada Flintridge, CA}30}29}13}-1}3}3/28/2011}I went here with my friend for some dessert and tea. We got the black sesame creme brulee and the green tea roll cake with sake ice cream. For tea I got the honey oolong tea. The tea was very simple and perfect for a cold day. The desserts were just mediocre. The first bite of the creme brulee was incredible, but the more I ate it, I started feeling nauseous and it became too heavy and creamy. The roll cake was not good. It was dry and the custard in the middle just tasted like nothing. The sake ice cream, however, was FANTASTIC. It was very refreshing and I loved the taste. If I come back here again it will be for the sake icecream
Ren T.}ASTORIA, NY}1}16}180}-1}4}3/27/2011}I've been here twice already and I really love the desserts. I start salivating just by staring at the menu! They also have foods other than desserts in their menu, but I have yet to try them. The ambience is also perfect for having dates. Expect to wait in the line though, as the place is pretty small.
Jennifer K.}Markham, Canada}125}6019}51995}18}4}3/24/2011}I just love Cha-An! Especially where I live up in Toronto there are NO Japanese style Teahouse as authentic as Cha-An!!We anxiously wait for Cha-An to open at 3 pm... I am so glad we got here right when it opened their doors, because this place did get fill up fast and it was a Monday too!!The vibe definitely authentic Japanese with slow, leisure services... you expected to just chill and relax and sip your tea and enjoy your dessert... and just take it slow........... breathe........ imagine you are in countryside in Japan.A good change of pace from the hustle of touristy places I visited in NYC!
Robert G.}Jersey City, NJ}1}13}0}-1}5}3/17/2011}I have been to Cha-An on several occasions, primarily for the Japanese teas.  As a bit of a tea snob, I have had high expectations.  My expectations were routinely exceeded at Cha-An, a small and authentic tea house with many quality teas, particularly of Japanese origin.While $7 might seem pricey to some for a small pot of tea, I would consider the price a bargain at Cha-An, particularly because the high quality teas can be infused over and over again (4-6 times, depending on the variety of tea).  That's about as much liquid as you could hope to quaff in one sitting.I cannot speak with much authority about the food, as I typically go just to enjoy the tea, but the few comestibles I've sampled have also been excellent.
WaYnE c.}Maple, Canada}32}1083}3082}18}3}3/17/2011}From the street sign placed during open-hours to the second storey climb upstairs.  The serene zen setting to the incense aroma covering up whatever miscellaneous washroom odours... . . .  .Everything here seems to remind and promote Japanese state-of-mind in calmness & relaxation.  Sumimasen, as I imagine the rituals of their Tea Ceremony and let my mind wander with minimal speech........ . . . . .  .     .     .      .     .Cha-An Sweets(Cookies, Scones, Pound Cake & More)Choice of Tea - Hojicha Green Tea ($15.00)Domo arigato !
Wendy H.}Phoenix, AZ}77}117}37}18}5}3/16/2011}Delicious lunch sets...the ambience is intimate. The servers are very attentive and keep your cup of tea warm and full. I would like to make this a regular experience.
Kelsey T.}New York, NY}367}440}62}-1}4}3/15/2011}This was a perfect, light, and surprisingly filling Japanese meal!I stumbled upon Cha-An when I was wandering the neighborhood w/ a friend looking for somewhere to eat. Being two girls who love tea, we decided this was a great spot to try and we both loved it!We got the Cha-An set B, which came with a bunch of small dishes. The soup wasn't anything spectacular, but the daily vegetable (dashi-soaked eggplant) - was amazingly good. I like eggplant, but I loved this! The tea-smoked salmon was very flavorful and was served upon some very fresh greens. The soy milk quiche was a very yummy chawan mushi-like dish and of course I loved it, it's one of the most comforting Japanese dishes available! They gave us two different desserts so we got to try more things, which was nice.What blew me away though was the selection of tea. Simply stunning selection of tea, it was so hard to pick one! And the best part was they kept refilling our hot water without us having to ask.Only drawback, it's cash only. So make sure to stop at the ATM on your way here.
Alice K.}Brooklyn, NY}22}25}7}-1}5}3/15/2011}mm.  yummy yummy in my tummy.black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream.  oh yeah.and the toast.  that is not just some regular ol' toast.  it's the most buttery and soft yet crispity toast with some butter cream on top.  mm, mm, mm.
Ashley K.}Los Angeles, CA}293}138}114}-1}4}3/15/2011}4.5 stars!!!!I went with a group of 6 girls and we ordered 4 desserts and 5 pots of tea.In order of deliciousness...1. Black Sesame Creme Brulee w/ black sesame ice cream2. Chocolate Souffle 3. Green Tea Mochi and Chocolate Earl Grey Mochi4. Toast with Red Bean butterThe only one I still rave about is #1. It was so good!!! It was nutty and not too sweet. It was what my korean palette's appreciated. If Cha-an was in LA I would go at least once a week or maybe every other week to eat the black sesame creme brulee :)
Chu Z.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}144}138}55}-1}3}3/14/2011}I have been to Cha-An for 3 times in 6 months...just to impress my girlfriends. They like little cute things :/The desserts/food are in small portion, tasty and pricey. Presented in cute dishes with nice deco, deserts and tea both look sophisticated even though they actually come from regular recipes. Food quality? Decent. Service? Alright."I feel I am paying for deco, nice plates, and human labor." I said this to my fellow yelper Nicole after reading her review. Obviously I am not the only one feeling it.I may still come back, but just to impress my gfs who fall for all these.
Nicole C.}Washington, DC}195}567}916}-1}3}3/14/2011}I noticed that most of the high ratings for this tea room come from women in their mid 20s. So, being a woman in my mid 20s, I thought I'd feel the same way, and met up with a girlfriend (also in her mid 20s) here for dessert, tea, and gossip.The ambiance here is lovely; the tea room was tranquil, even though it was a full house. We shared the:1) Cha-An Sweets ($16) - An assortment of desserts including a chocolate-filled macaron, green tea & red bean cake, lemon poundcake, chocolate cookie, scone, and clotted cream & jam for dipping. It also came with a pot of tea; we chose the Honey Oolong.2) Zenzai Dessert ($9) - Sake ice cream with black sesame crisp, mochi balls, chestnut & azuki bean jellies in green tea matcha soup. This dessert was featured in an article on SeriousEats.Everything was delicate and enjoyable, but for the prices we paid, the portions were really small. They're worth a try, just keep in mind that you're paying more for the novelty of cute japanese desserts than anything else.
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}4}3/12/2011}As many people have mentioned, the black sesame creme brulee is a winner. I literally always scratch the sides of the cup/bowl to scoop up every last bit of its deliciousness. Dim sum is very fresh, if a little overpriced, and rice dishes are generally good. They tend to change the lunch sets pretty often, but I tend to think of this place as more of a snack stop rather than a place for dinner.Entrance is a bit too cramped.
Qing Y.}Flushing, NY}58}46}6}-1}3}3/9/2011}My friend and I wanted a nice quiet place to warm up after a long walk in the cold and we were excited to find a Japanese teahouse. We ordered some dim sum (small snacks for tea) and two pots of tea. We rather enjoyed our tea, but the dim sum dishes left much to be desired. The teahouse had a nice ambience and was ideal for chatting.
Kent W.}New York, NY}74}308}9}-1}4}3/2/2011}You know? Some places aren't about the food, but more for the memories we have at that place. A friend, that I haven't seen in 10 years, came here with me after dinner for desserts. We drank tea and ate mochi and souffle with black sesame crunch on top. It was a very relaxing environment - we sat for hours and just talked about our last 10 years. * miss her much
Monica J.}New York, NY}121}151}32}-1}5}2/28/2011}Came here on a first date and fell in love with the decor as soon as I walked in. It's a small space but much more on the cozy side than it is stuffy. My date and I were the only non-asians in there (well, aside from the old white man and what appeared to be his significantly younger female... whatever you wanna call it) so I can say with quite a bit of confidence that Cha-An is as authentic as it gets. Hidden away on the second floor amidst your typical EV bars, it is a zen-like oasis from the bustle of the neighborhood in which it resides. The menu had quite a few delicious sounding items, and judging from the table next to us, the food is definitely worth a try! Unfortunately, we had both already eaten dinner and decided to just get some tea. Their tea menu is pretty extensive, I had a bit of a tough time choosing but ended up going with the Teguanyn. Boy, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. A few minutes later the waitress brought over this wooden box with about 6 or 7 ceramic containers of different shapes and sizes. Thankfully she began to explain the process because I would have been completely lost otherwise. First she poured the tea leaves into a little teapot, and then poured hot water over it, covered it, and then poured the water into a bigger glass vessel through a strainer, then she poured that water into 3 smaller glasses - one of which looked like a tiny tea cup, the other two shot glasses. One of the shot glasses looking ones was apparently for smell.... then she proceeded to pour more water into the teapot and then poured the 3 cups of water over the teapot.. to warm it. THEN, she finally poured the water in the teapot into the bigger glass vessel with the strainer and then into the tiny tea cup. FINALLY it was ok to drink. There was also a little white chocolate covered thing with what tasted like a black sesame and pretzel combo... either way it was delicious. The tea was very light but good- once I finally got around to tasting it. Never have I seen a tea ceremony this elaborate. It was quite a bit of work to drink given that the tea cup was so tiny. Felt almost like a chore but it was so cute that I can't really knock it for that. This is definitely a great date place... if you have a good date person to go with that is. I will let you figure out what that implies about my date but I will tell you that I had to go home after about an hour to get some work done... Will most certainly come back here again. I love this place. Great place to hole up with someone and immerse yourself in conversation for hours. Almost didn't want to leave this review so i could keep it a secret for myself in this crazy crowded city!
Ann L.}San Diego, CA}167}140}39}-1}4}2/20/2011}This place has been on my Yelp bookmark list under "to try" for the longest time. Things that stopped me from going: 1) never having time, 2) not remembering that it was on my list to begin with, and 3) not knowing where the heck this place was located. I briefly caught a glimpse of the sign once when I was cabbing home from somewhere but that was it. So, finally, when another friend of mine suggested that we go here for dessert after another sodium-laden bowl of deliciousness at Ippudo, I jumped at the chance. The place was small, though, and we had a group of 5, resulting in a wait of one hour. (Protip: small groups are the way to go for most places in NYC.) It worked out well, though, since it gave me time to digest my dinner and leave more room for dessert.Things we tried: the chocolate souffle, creme brulee with black sesame ice cream, and green tea mochi. Favorite was definitely the chocolate souffle, with the creme brulee coming in at a close second. They have a pretty extensive dessert and tea menu, though, so I wouldn't mind going back and sampling the other well-crafted sweets.Other things of note: CASH ONLY! And the desserts aren't cheap, either... Service was attentive and friendly, which is always appreciated.
Makiko O.}New York, NY}10}33}1}-1}5}2/19/2011}someone once said to me, "japanese desserts are the bomb!" well, cha-an exemplifies this statement to the max. you order from over 30 types of teas (green, white, black, herbal, oolong, pu-erh, etc.) and an array of delectable desserts. my favorite is the black sesame crème brulée.
Subin L.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}75}21}23}-1}4}2/18/2011}My boyfriend and I had our valentines day dinner here, and I highly recommend it for a date spot. The tea is the best part about this place, and if you need a break from the same old coffee shop that you can find at every corner in this city, this is certainly a unique experience.  There are so many different types of tea to choose from, and the menu comes with a brief description for each one.  I chose one of the Japanese green teas and it was so delicious I must have had them refill my pot at least five times! The food was tasty, and they compliment the tea very well.  A warning for the hungry guys though, because the portions won't be enough to fill you up.  I would definitely revisit this place for the tea especially during the cold months.  Perfect place to simply sip some tea and talk with your date!
Tassawalai P.}Alexandria, VA}2}5}4}-1}5}2/18/2011}I have heard a lot of good things about Cha-An from a couple of my friends living in NYC.  Yesterday I had a chance to go to NYC and I didn't hesitate to try!Well, I was full from my lunch so I went for a dessert instead although their lunch special menu was so tempting--only 10 bucks! The first thing I was really impressed about this place is their interior design which makes their whole ambiance very traditional Japanese--zen-like.  Ok...so I had no idea what to order because everything seemed to be very delish!! So I asked the server what I should order for my first visit here and what's their signature dessert.  She recommended the "Black Sesame Creme Brulee" and "Chocolate Souffle with Raspberry Sauce".  I didn't feel like having heavy dessert or chocolaty one.  Moreover I wanna go for something Japanese so I picked 'Black Sesame Creme Brulee"  OMG! It's divine!!! Everything melt in my mouth!! They served their homemade black sesame ice cream on top of the creme brulee.  It's such a nice combination!! I love everything about it.  At first I kinda thought it must have been similar to the black sesame tofu at Kytofu.  But it's not!!! I simply love it!! So if you have a chance to go to Cha-An, don't miss their "Black Sesame Creme Brulee"I will definitely go there again and will bring my friends along!
Adam C.}Brooklyn, NY}2}4}0}-1}5}2/17/2011}Fantastic! The Japanese girls are very polite and friendly. The green tea from Japan (cannot remember the name) taste really idyllic, haha. I ordered a set called Cha-gayo (if not mistaken), including a congee and five other small dishes and a dessert. Amazing! and it was only 18. Excellent price for the environment and food! Strongly recommend!
Lee J.}Brooklyn, NY}4}109}0}-1}4}2/17/2011}The food is surprisingly lovelyAlthough I wonder how often they change their menuI would five star this place but the ambiance can suffer from clueless types who get one cup of tea and linger all night when there is a wait...
Erika H.}New York, NY}36}107}4}-1}4}2/14/2011}Delicious teas and delicious desserts -- I highly recommend you get the afternoon tea set paired with some sort of green tea (I got kabusecha). The scones, one flavored lightly with chocolate and the other flavored with earl grey, were amazing. They are baked while you wait, and come out piping hot :) I enjoyed the unique fusion of traditional Japanese tea and food with the British tradition of Afternoon Tea.
Matthew C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}18}0}-1}4}2/12/2011}Food: The the teas I've tried (chamomile and silver needle) are good. But what you should come here for are the desserts. In particular, the black sesame creme brulee and the Zenzai (sake ice cream, chestnuts, matcha green tea sauce/soup) are fantastic, and their chocolate souffle is a favorite of one of my friends.Service: Very good. Food arrives promptly and tea is refilled if ordered. No credit card service makes me sad.Be prepared to deal with a 10-30 minute wait if you arrive late night (9pm onward). We were turned away once because we showed up close to closing time and the wait was long.I'll have to try their set meals one day, if it they are very good, this place definitely deserves 5 stars. What I have been doing though is going to Soba-ya across the street and then going to Cha-An for desert. Heavenly.
Christina L.}Los Angeles, CA}134}87}0}-1}5}1/29/2011}I was a bit skeptical when I told my friend I wanted to get some tea, and he made me go to this place. I was like "what's the point of paying so much for tea, I could just go to Starbucks"...but it's worth it! :) They have a variety of teas to choose from. I honestly can't even recall the tea that I ordered (so many different names, and I am definitely not a tea-connoisseur) However, they bring your cup of tea (of course) and then a pot of the tea.. So I guess it's worth the 5 or more bucks that you spend on it!The place itself is really cute! I loved the bathrooms...so high tech! I guess it's the Japanese techy-part of it! :) There are private rooms that you can get for like 20-40 a person, depending if you want food or just dessert, which I think would be so awesome to utilize if you want a really romantic date! I like this place, and will be back!
Bryan T.}New York, NY}347}45}69}-1}4}1/25/2011}restaurantbrat.comAs a general rule I am much more a coffee person than a tea person. In my mind, an expertly brewed mug of dark-roast java is perhaps one of life's simplest yet most indulgent pleasures. I have my daily fix sans the sugar and milk, black as the night - a potent, earthy broth with a pungent aroma capable of revitalizing even the most languid morning grouch. I like my caffeine to growl, punch me in the face, and corrode my tonsils. I'll sometimes punish my stomach lining in this manner up to four times a day. Tea, on the other hand, is a different beast altogether. I will succumb to a zesty cup of chai every once in a while, or perhaps a numbingly spicy teh halia (Singaporean ginger tea), but for the most part, tea in my mind often seems a bland drink devoid of any attitude. I suppose I can be partial to extreme behavior. To each his own. I do, however, understand how to appreciate subtlety on occasion, especially when it comes to food and beverage. The Japanese, for instance, have made an art out of simplicity, and their fresh, pure cuisine is a testament to the premise of ascetic fulfillment. On a recent visit to Cha-An Tea House for brunch, I was reintroduced to tea, and saw firsthand a beverage disarming and shy, stripped down to but unobtrusive flavors and faint bouquets.Lo and behold! A pot of hot water magically transformed into Flower Craft Green Tea, as a modest pair of tightly spun bulbs blossomed into a joyous watercolor before our eyes. A potpourri of faded greens and pinks, the tea was as beautiful to look at as it was to taste. A whiff of jasmine, a fleeting touch of chrysanthemum, each sip was teasingly delicate and supremely balanced. A second pot, this time of a white tea mysteriously named the Yinzhen Silver Needle, was just as exquisite, but with a more distinct body. I sniffed at it and sipped it, I rolled it around my tongue, and tried to chew it. I treated my cup as though Yinzhen Silver Needle was in fact Napa Silver Oak, and it must have subliminally returned the favor, as I fell into a dreamy, otherworldly stupor, relaxed and utterly content.   I snapped out of it only when the food arrived. Cha-An offers a number of good lunch options, and in my temporal state of languorousness and comfort, I had opted for an order of porridge, to be served with what our server described as a daily rotation of six Japanese mini-appetizers. The porridge was thick, starchy and absolutely tasteless - and yet, all facetiousness aside, absolutely delightful. It was just what I needed. The light purple grains of Japanese rice lent a nice viscosity to the bowl, and the porridge could not have been more suitable as a platform for the bolder tasting accompanying side dishes. Of the six, savory Curried Squid Rings and tart Pickled Mustard Greens with Sesame were winners. I paid less attention to a thimble of Pickled Radish (slimy with yam extract) and the Grated Salmon (baked, and just a little dry for my liking). My dining companion had ordered the rice set, which featured a dry version of my purple rice porridge, and a number of different, meatier accompanying dishes. Noteworthy among those that I sampled included the Soymilk Quiche with Mushrooms and Scallions, and the Shiso Chicken. The former had the texture of silky artisanal tofu in the middle and a crisp crust on the outside, and the latter featured tender chunks of dark meat paired with a coy kiss of mint. There was a salad with a tea-smoked salmon topping that I did not try, but which looked fairly decent. Among the sides in the rice set, I probably enjoyed the Curried Eggplant with String Beans the least. The oversized aubergine chunks were soggy and did not pair as well with the mild curry sauce as the squid from my porridge set.I was pleased to discover that Cha-An's dessert menu was very good indeed. A Cappuccino Sponge Roll with Strawberries was fluffy and delicious, as was a Japanese Choux Crème. I am not normally a big dessert person, but both of these were anorexically light, and found myself inadvertently especially enjoying the latter, a cream puff of absolutely phenomenal quality, possessing just the right amount of coffee flavor to satisfy this perpetual java-addict.Cha-An Tea House is a tiny, cluttered, one-of-a-kind tribute to all that is good about the Art of Tea. An oasis of calm on the second floor of a nondescript shophouse; a serene sanctuary of reflection and appreciation. I am nowhere near understanding the complex yet profoundly uncomplicated meaning behind a simple pot of tea, and accordingly am miles away from the status of my tea connoisseur friends. You won't find me forsaking my morning coffee anytime soon, and my penchant for exaggeration will probably persist. Ultimately though, I guess every lesson counts.
Elizabeth P.}San Diego, CA}15}269}15}-1}4}1/22/2011}Cha-An is a cute and cozy Japanese tea house great for tea and desserts with friends.  They have an extensive list of tea with great variety.  I tried one of the green teas, along with the green tea and chocolate mochi, and both were delicious.  I wish they had more dessert options however, because there were only a handful of desserts to choose from.
Grace K.}New York, NY}23}46}10}-1}5}1/21/2011}One of my favorite spots in East Village!Soooo many kinds of teas and delicious desserts!I usually go for dessert. Generally, their desserts are not too sweet. If you don't like too sweet treats, it will be a good place! Especially their chocolate mochi and cake are pretty good. Also if you are not a coffee fan, you would like there as well! :)They take CASH only!Dessert price is not too cheap, but not too expensive. Dessert portion is small too. However, for a cup of tea it is fairly good price. You can refill your tea as many times you want! Usually you need to wait for a table when you go there. Most of time they are busy.
Janel Y.}Walnut Creek, CA}301}1407}1628}-1}4}1/20/2011}This place has been on my list to try for about 1.5 years. I finally got a chance to check it out when an out of town friend was visiting.Here's what the two of us shared:-some kind of set that included: 15 grain rice porridge with side of minced beef, bok choy and mushrooms. We also got smaller dishes of seaweed, salmon, a pickled vegetable, a plum and something else. The whole tray was delicious and reminded me of when I was in Takayama and Mt. Koya during my Japan vacay-matcha latte: DELICIOUS! I would come back just for this green tea drink! There were some red beans at the bottom too. The drink was smooth and creamy and with a green tea flavor-black sesame creme brulee: it looks like your regular creme brulee but what you thought was vanilla bean is actually black sesame! The top was perfectly torched and the flavor of the dish wasn't too sweet at allWhen I arrived, I scored the last table on a weekday, around 5PM. The place is small, but very traditional. Dining here is as if you have time traveled to Japan. Service was friendly and attentive.I would come back just for the matcha latte and/or black sesame creme brulee!
Eve Z.}Brooklyn, NY}183}32}24}-1}5}1/19/2011}I just spent a good 4 hours here chatting and drinking tea. I ordered the Honey Phoenix (Oolong) and the Makinohara Sencha (Green) along with Cha-an dessert set. Everything tasted scrumptious and the tea was excellent. Our bill came out to $100--what a splurge at a teahouse haha. My friends and I were having profound conversations and I hope we didn't disturb the other patrons when we got a wee bit excited. Random:The bathroom is gorgeous! I had to go multiple times thanks to all the tea I drank. I even went into the mens room because the woman was taking way too long in there. The womens bathroom is much nicer and the toilet is high tech (mwahaha) :)Important: Cash only.
Ariel G.}Redwood City, CA}117}97}1}-1}4}1/17/2011}The sesame cream brulee is great! I've been there twice, but only this time I was told they only accepted cash. I didn't remember if it was the same policy about 6 months ago, but if you didn't prepare enough cash for it, it would be a turn-down when you were ready to leave.Despite of that, all are great, the desserts, teas, and the meal sets (they only have two options, both of them are like light dinners, which is good for girls). I ordered lavender mint tea for this time, together with sesame cream brulee, the sweetness of the cream brulee is balanced by the tea. It's nice a place to meet with friends and have a relaxing afternoon tea.
Lai T.}Fremont, CA}7}115}11}-1}3}1/9/2011}I can only give this place 3 stars. As much as I want to like this place, I thought the service could've been better. We came here for an early dinner a few weeks ago around 5:30pm. This is a great tea house with a wide selection of teas. Since they have perfected the tea selection, brewing and service, they really need to work on the rest of their offerings. The dishes are ok, probably better to stick with tea snacks than the meals the next time I go. I ordered a set menu that included 4 small dishes, including rice & soup. Everything was well prepared, but the flavors didn't particularly complement each other. Everything was also served lukewarm, except for the rice. I thought it was a bit weird that even the soup was lukewarm, but since I've never had this type of Japanese cuisine before, I thought it was  supposed to be that way. The set meal came with a dessert, cream puffs. I think Beard Papa's cream puffs are better. I also ordered the matcha tea which was $3 extra because it was a special tea. It was really smooth and very good. I wish I was more of a tea connoiseur so I could've appreciated that more. I would recommend not ordering a set menu if you plan on coming here, that way you can choose what you eat. It wasn't until we were ready to pay when I saw that the person on the table next to me ordered the same thing, and his bowl of soup came out steaming hot! I was fuming mad inside! This is the main reason why they get only 3 stars from me!Oh, FYI this is a cash only establishment.
Audrey A.}Burbank, CA}5}41}3}-1}5}1/7/2011}Cha-An has an authentic atmosphere and polite service.I've brought many close friends here for cozy chats over meals or tea and everyone always leaves satisfied.Meals ordered include the tofu quiche and a special with eel over rice. They are...amazing. The tofu quiche is really unique to the restaurant so I usually order that. Though the portions are rather small, they taste above average when compared to many other Japanese restaurants in the area.Sometimes I sit at the counter-bar while reading a book over tea and I never feel hurried to leave even when the place is full. It's a great place to come alone or with a friend.Highly highly recommended.Cash only.
Jen C.}Potomac, MD}514}369}357}18}4}1/2/2011}Very cozy spot to wind down from a long day of exploring NYC in the winter... so cozy that we ended up back here two times. I would say any other time of year this would be a little pricey when you can get good tea on the go elsewhere. After going up the stairs to Cha-An, you will discover superb tea here that is sipped in a dim, private, quiet ambiance. There is one small table that has a bamboo backdrop and enclave of its own, which was always occupied when I was there. Both times I came were around 8-9pm, and we were seated immediately. Never did we feel rushed, even when it was a full house.The reviews raved about the dessert here, but I found it to be overpriced, and even less than bite sized. We had a rum raisin macaroon which was odd, a teeny 5cm :( scoop of ice cream with a sesame chip, and a third dessert which was clearly unforgettable because I can't remember what it was. The dessert 3 course was priced at $17 with your choice of tea. Sticky rice pork balls were good but overpriced. I was too tempted by the "dim sum special" card. My head was telling me no but my tummy was the main decider here. In retrospect, it was a bad decision to buy these 2 balls for $5, because you can easily get cheap cheap dim sum in other places in much higher quantities. The mochi was tasty but not the best mochi I've had. I liked chocolate a lot better than that macha, as the macha had an overpowering fishy flavor that I can't really get over. Matcha latte with red beans came in a huge cup, whereas the chai latte came in a smaller mug but was my favorite drink there (both were $7 a cup). Didn't really taste the "latte" part of it, but tasty nonetheless. Puh-er and green teas were quality.What I appreciate about this place is that the tea is generous and ambiance is very cozy. They refill it with hot water immediately after you finish drinking a cup without you even needing to ask. Come here for bevs, but avoid the overpriced/overhyped treats.
Louis C.}Brooklyn, NY}10}14}1}-1}4}12/30/2010}Ah good 'ol Cha-An. It's a great post dinner place if you're on a date. Also great if you want to warm up in the winter. I've visited this fine establishment a few times and have had the same great experience every time. Sure the teas are a bit overpriced but the ambiance and desserts you can have here are worth it. It's a dimly lit, soft music playing in the background, warm, cozy environment. I forget which teas I've had here but they should be from the black tea bunch as I like my teas on the bitter side. None of that fruity stuff for me. I'll admit I'm not an avid tea drinker nor do I think of myself as a tea expert but I can tell you, the teas aren't the same kind you would find in a Lipton tea pouch. They have a very extensive tea list and I'm sure there's a tea for everyone at Cha-An. I've pretty much had almost all the desserts they serve here... multiple times and have never been disappointed. I would recommend the chef's dessert assortment if you are new to the place since you get a nice variety and it's well priced. Regardless of what you get, you'll be pleasantly surprised as well as happy with how delicious it tastes.
Laura A.}Jersey City, NJ}259}7}0}-1}5}12/13/2010}My sister and I had lunch here a few days ago, and I love it! The food is amazing, and so is the tea! The place is quite cozy. The staff is also quite friendly. It's a tiny bit pricey for me, but I'd eat here whenever I'm in the area!
Jack X.}Elmhurst, NY}341}105}65}-1}5}12/8/2010}One of the few places in NYC that is really a tea house and not just a busy bubble tea lounge.The decor is a little dark and it has a trendy Japanese feel to it but is quite small but when you sit it is not packed. If you come during busy hours for dessert or even early dinner the place maybe packed and you will have to wait in a tight spot but usually the wait isnt too long.They offer a wide selection of teas from European floral teas to traditional Japanese and Chinese teas as well as some trendy drinks like a azuki macha (red bean with power green tea) served cold. They do not serve alcohol in case anyone was wondering.They offer lunch and dinner specials but I have not tried them although they do look delicious from time to time. The only thing people usually order here are the desserts which can be paired wonderfully with some of teas such as the earl grey chocolate mochi with some matcha or darker teas. Overall every time I come here I have a great time and its a wonderful place to go with a close friend or a date.P.S. Not for groups
Adam R.}Brooklyn, NY}4}18}0}-1}5}12/6/2010}Cha-An is a great place to relax with some friends and enjoy tea and amazing desserts.  I usually ask them to pick a tea for me based on the dessert I order since they know better than I do.  Of course, the sesame creme brulee is AMAZING and so is their tea selection.  I am still yet to try their scones, but I tried the mochi and it was nothing special.  The atmosphere of this place is the most relaxed that I have found in NY yet, and I go to Cha-An every time I am in the area and have some free time.
Elaine S.}Brooklyn, NY}107}33}0}-1}4}12/4/2010}Been to this place twice. The first time my friend brought me there, we had some tea thing that i thought was really cute. not sure what tea it was but it was pretty soothing. and its fun to play with the cups and smell the aroma. The second time I brought a different friend there. I ordered the Scarlet Glow because it sounded good to me but I didn't really like it. Tasted sour to me. I like my tea light and soothing. My friend ordered some oolong tea one that was okay. I ordered a zenzai and it blew my mind away. It was so delicious. I forgot exactly what my friend ordered to snack on but it was pretty good too. The environment was very relaxing. It is a nice place to just be at with company after a long stressful day. The bathroom is pretty nice too. definitely a place i'll go back to.
Yan T.}Manhattan, NY}2475}1685}224}18}5}11/27/2010}Tucked away from the street-level noise and greedy eyes of NYU students, this place is a much-needed 2nd floor refuge in the East Village. They have a great variety of Japanese teas, not cheap but generous with refills. There are also some excellent prix-fixe options that include traditional tea snacks as well as Japanese touches--squid, veggies, lox, etc. There's a private tea ceremony room but you have to reserve it. Get your tea on!
Carina N.}San Francisco, CA}118}275}296}-1}4}11/23/2010}Tucked away on the 9th street, Cha An is a little oasis in the busy New York city.  Straight up the fleet of stairs, behind those fabric curtains is a tea bar.  I like their $10 daily special.  On Mondays it's Chicken Soboro (minced chicken with fresh herbs and rice), a side dish of chicken simmered in broth, some pickles, and genmai (brown rice green) tea.  Black sesame pudding is as good as everyone mentioned, topped with black sesame ice-cream and a piece of honey glazed thin pastry.  The $16 special A on the multi-grain porridge was however not so impressive.  It did came with a delicious chestnut cream tea roll with berries though.  We've also attended their tea ceremony ($15/person), lasted about 30 min that includes only 2 pieces of plain mochi and a taste of Matcha.  It was a very very brief intro on tea ceremony, and the hostess even dressed up formally for us.  I thought it was interesting but didn't really worth $15 for that though.  Then again, I'd love to come back again for their delicious dessert and tea!
justin t.}New York, NY}25}189}3}-1}5}11/22/2010}tucked away on the second floor on a quiet street in the east village, this tea house is a sanctuary for the weathered folk of nyc. the serene ambiance not only soothes one, but prepares one for the delicate cuisine served at cha an.first start off with a pot of tea, and we had a wonderful oolong that had hints of honey and citrus. some of the best tea, if not the best i have had.We had the chef's dessert assortment that consisted of sesame creme brullee, a strawberry mouse, chestnut pie/pastry and macarons and crackers. just sit back and relax and before you know it, it is a few hours later.i however would steer clear of the matcha sake cocktail.
Ari P.}Chicago, IL}10}130}0}-1}5}11/18/2010}Great, peaceful ambiance.  Excellent food at amazing prices (if you buy the set meals).
Thinh N.}New York, NY}145}44}4}-1}5}11/14/2010}sesame creme-brulee - believe the hype -- it's so freaking good!!! also -- beware of the wait -- I came with a friend on a saturday night -- the wait was an hour and a half -- we gave up and came back on a weekday.
Ginny L.}New York, NY}51}371}35}-1}3}11/5/2010}I wasnt too impressed with Cha-An.....the menu is small....and when we were there....we ordered the different set of meals....but somehow we ended up eating each other's orders because the lady who took our order got confused and gave us what our friends have ordered...food is ok...their dessert menu was pretty good...
Jen Y.}San Francisco, CA}4}77}0}-1}3}10/27/2010}the space is pretty nice with lots of wood and a cute little fireplace/hut niche. i tried the zenzai. it had soo much stuff in it mochi, red bean jellies, chestnut, maccha soup, and sake ice cream. it was like a meal in itself. the best parts of the it were the soup and the sake ice cream, which is house made. the alcohol taste was light, and i think there may have been some vanilla beans in them, which gave it a nice flavor too. overall i liked it, but the jellies, mochi, and chestnut may have been a bit too much. i saw the next table had the azuki toast with ice cream which looked very delicious. maybe ill try that next time...
tina l.}New York, NY}31}57}15}-1}3}10/25/2010}as soon as you walk up the stairs, you get the feeling that youve walked onto the set of a movie located in japan. its pretty cute, ill admit that. there is one table that has a canopy/hut built over it, and it makes for a great photo op. i ordered the genmaicha green tea for $5, which is pricey, but they kept the hot water coming, refill after refill. i also ordered the black sesame creme brulee. the best part is the little black sesame cookie on top of the ice cream. the black sesame custard itself is... weird. i love me some black sesame ice cream from chinatown, but this creme brulee was not doing that little seed any justice. you pay for the ambiance. its peaceful, comfortable, and scenic.
Sasha M.}New York, NY}210}210}15}-1}4}10/23/2010}Black Sesame Creme Brulee is indeed out of this world.4 stars only because the other item we tried - green matcha ice cream - was really disappointingly sweet and flavorless. Decor, ambiance, menu otherwise is stellar.
MichLee A.}New York, NY}9}456}2}-1}4}10/21/2010}4.5 Stars.The only reason why we didn't give this place five stars is because the lunch special (which we were able to get at almost 7pm even though the restaurant claims to limit it to fifteen servings per weekday) lacked a bit of protein.However, the ambiance, gentle waitstaff, and quality of tea makes this one of the best restaurants and best values to be found in the East Village.We enjoyed the teriyaki-don which was served on top of a sizable portion of lightly flavored but very moist whole grain rice with a side of tofu crumble and pickled Japanese cucumber. The endless refills of imported genmaicha green tea complemented the fabulously authentic dinner.Great for dates.
Vanessa X.}Chicago, IL}169}486}0}-1}5}10/17/2010}Such a charming little Japanese place! It is small with maybe only about 20-25 seats and a few at the bar but it is arranged so cozily you would barely mind. Unlike many faux Japanese places around the city this one reeks authenticity. I've never been to Japan so I wouldn't know but I imagine it wouldn't be so different. The brown wood walls, the low beamed ceilings, the tiny tiny teacups and the bamboo utensils are perfected down to the finest detail.The menu is eclectic and randomly arranged but it makes it all the more fun to flip through it and just go with whatever looks/sounds good to you at the moment. Whether it's oolong tea (which is what we got) or mochi balls or pork and tofu balls or  scones, anything and all is equally delightful. The tea is presented in a unique way with little baby cups for sniffing tea's aroma, tongs, two identical porcelain cups, and an adorable glass tea strainer. The tea set for two came also with two chocolate biscuits which complemented the honey tinted tea very well.This is a great place to come for an afternoon chat with tea and dessert, and anxiety melts away in a such a serene and unpretentious atmosphere. I am completely charmed.
Kevin C.}New York, NY}272}533}221}18}4}10/12/2010}This is an absolute GEM of a place in East Village.My first time at a Japanese tea room turned out to be a great experience. I shared a "set" which came with a choice of tea and 3-4 mini desserts. The teas were really refreshing and delicious. I had the chai without milk and my friend had a white tea that tasted of almonds and honey. Our dessert consisted of jasmine ice cream, green tea pound cake, some flan type thing, and macaroons/mini cookies. The presentation was beautiful. And for $17, I thought it was very reasonable.I'll def be back for more!
Tiffany D.}Arlington, TX}1786}870}756}18}4}9/30/2010}I want to have a tea party here! I want to come back in my kimono and pretend I'm a high class geisha. I wonder if Paul H. would play along with me. :P I really enjoy ending the evening here. I mellowed out with Paul H. and another couple over creme brulee and tea. OMFG Their black sesame creme brulee hits the spot. The brulee part is exquisite (you get that hard crunch when you crack the shell with your spoon). The deep rich black sesame flavor was wonderfully enhanced by our silver needle white tea. I can't wait to come back here to try more things. ::drools::
Maria G.}Oakland, CA}69}166}1}-1}5}9/26/2010}This was the highlight of my visit to New York this past weekend! I came here with a friend and we both got the Chef's Dessert Assortment. I got the Twelve Trees Oolong tea and it was amazing! It was a flavorful yet light tea and possibly the best tea I've had!The ice cream was great (green tea) + macaron + an amazing black sesame creme brulee. Absolutely great atmosphere (very relaxing), plus amazing tea, dessert and best of all, amazingly attentive service!I would absolutely go back!

Janie W.}York, ME}44}287}0}-1}3}9/25/2010}Been to Cha-An twice now. I think it's nice but perhaps over-rated. The space itself is tiny and there's a decent tea selection with a few food options. The $10 lunch option was a fantastic deal - on Saturday we had an unagi-don with a little side dish and a pot of genmai cha. That is a good deal. Not for picky eaters though, since their food selection is small and there is no substitution. I also enjoyed the black sesame creme brulee, but more so b/c I enjoy black sesame than anything else.
Catherine C.}Elmhurst, NY}705}254}952}-1}5}9/24/2010}Black sesame creme brulee is mouthgasmic!!!!!!!!Loved everything I ordered, from the tea to the delicious desserts! I haven't tried their regular food but I will definitely come back, again and again!The bathroom is awesome! Comes with heated seats and bidet.. only in the girls' bathroom though. I wonder why...
Ellen M.}Brooklyn, NY}64}41}35}-1}4}9/23/2010}This is a cute traditional Japanese tea house in East Village.  I love their chef's dessert and tea set.  It comes with 3 course dessert and a choice of tea.  I tried matcha green tea which was truly gourmet compared to everyday green tea.  It was so smooth and creamy.  My favorite and memorable dessert was black sesame creme brulee.  This is a place to chat with your close friends and enjoy your down time, not a place to go when you're in a hurry to grab a quick meal.
Ida C.}Singapore, Singapore}330}437}852}-1}4}9/20/2010}After accidentally falling asleep and missing dinner with a group of friends, I awoke to a terse text ultimatum to meet the crew at Cha-An Tea House for post-dinner sweets and cocktails...OR ELSE.  For the next 5 minutes, I slid around my apartment in my socks to make myself as presentable as possible.  Then I traded my socks for heels and clicked out the door and on downtown.  I was delighted by the tranquil atmosphere upstairs at Cha-An.  It felt a world away from the hustle and bustle of (much beloved) St. Marks.  The array of desserts was tempting, but I selected the Black Sesame Creme Brulee ($8) because how could the love child of sesame and creme brulee be anything other than delicious?  It was indeed sumptuous and with the added bonuses of a ball of (very likely) homemade black sesame ice cream and a crisp black sesame and caramel cookie (almost like a florentine without the chocolate).  Under the ice cream, the burnt sugar cracked wonderfully and exposed a nice thick layer of rich creamy sesame creme!  It was nicely balanced and not too sweet.  I practically licked the little pot!I ordered the Sake Mojito ($7) to accompany my dessert, but it didn't do a lot for me.  It was ok, but not particularly novel or alcoholic.  My friend ordered the Matcha Comfort ($7.50), which she described to resemble slightly alcoholic melted green tea ice cream.  That sounded appealing, but might have pushed me into heavy cream overdose.  I think I would have been much better served to try one of the many different types of tea.  When we were heading out we noticed a small private room.  Apparently, Cha-An offers Japanese Tea Ceremonies and private dining for a maximum of 3 people.  Looks like a fun place for dessert with a date!  Unless you are used to tatami, a full dinner may be a bit painful on the legs.PARTING THOUGHT: Check out the toilet in the ladies room!  FANCY!
Stacey K.}New York, NY}107}229}29}-1}4}9/19/2010}Cozy Japanese tea, lunch, and dessert joint.  I had one of the set menus- though the food was really good, the presentation and quality were well above average.  The service was attentive and there wasn't any language barriers.  This place is my new lady-day lunch spot! lav it lav it!
Valery C.}Forest Hills, NY}54}814}8719}18}4}9/18/2010}This small tea house, located a flight up from street level, is classic Japanese in style and atmosphere, and really reminded me of places I visited in Japan.  The staff are Japanese, and not all speak English well.  Upon entering at the top of the stairs is a small bar (seats about 6) that faces the cleaning and tea prep area, backed by shelves reaching the ceiling holding large jars of tea.  You can see through to the kitchen in the back where the food and desserts are made.  The dining space is fairly small, cozy, everything in dark wood paneling.The menu has food options, mostly simple rice dishes and small plates, with some sets offered.  Also a large choice of desserts and many teas to choose from.  They also have beers, including some not typically found in most places.  The menu is separated by tabs.Having come after eating a meal elsewhere, I went with the chef's dessert assortment, which included a tea.  I really should have tried a hot tea (usually my preference).  Unfortunately, fresh off the street and hot sun, I submitted to impulse and got a cold hibiscus tea, which was quite nice: tastes simple but sweetness and hibiscus flavor were well-balanced and smooth.There were five different items in the dessert assortment, in small but reasonable portions:-  yogurt ice cream with fruit compote - refreshing, very mild yogurt flavor-  pound cake with strawberries - light cake, light cream, not very sweet-  basic flan - surprisingly sweeter than I expected for the Japanese take on flan but no sweeter than Spanish flan tends to be; caramel flavor is very strong but also just a bit burnt-  scone - very fresh, lightly crisp exterior and crumbly interior with a light filling.  Better than any scone I've ever had before.-  mini nut muffin - also fresh, warm, slightly crisped exteriorOverall the desserts, while not extraordinary, were fairly good.  Cha-An is a pleasant place to briefly get away from the busy city life.  Its also a great place to visit if you're looking for an authentic, simple Japanese tea house/snack place.  Just wanted to also mention that their bathroom comes equipped with the multi-function Japanese toilets, which are awesome.
Reviewer ..}Los Angeles, CA}0}30}0}-1}4}9/17/2010}My friend and I arrived for lunch shortly after noon on Friday. The place had just opened, and we were probably the second party to arrive. We were quickly seated by a cozy window and given menus. The atmosphere was great. Very simple and understated, clean lines, earth tone. They played jazz in the background, which really set the relaxing toneOur waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes and teas. We ended up deciding on the 6-plate appetizer sampler, the shrimp appetizer, the salmon tar tar don, green tea mochi, and the dessert of the day (a raspberry ice cream dish). The food was SUCH a breath of fresh air. Most Japanese places serve Chinese-influenced dishes, perhaps because it has wider appeal, but Cha-an stayed true to some of the most basic and organic Japanese flavors. We would highly recommend the 6-plate appetizer. Each dish was uniquely flavored and it was fun to share. As for tea, we had a hibiscus-based tea and a green-tea with toasted rice (i know, sounds strange!). The hibiscus tea was lovely! Light and flowery, not too sweet, not too bitter. The green tea was quite original! It had a light, yet nutty taste...one I've never tasted before....I loved it!Overall, a lovely experience. The menu is so large and diverse, I will definitely be back to explore it further :)I'd recommend going here for: date, break from NYC, relaxing dinner, dessert.Would not recommend for: hungry people (portions arent that large); large groups (the space is quite intimate)
Dorothy L.}San Francisco, CA}64}503}317}-1}5}9/9/2010}I love the set choices.  It's a nice place to relax and enjoy your afternoon tea.  Do not miss out on the matcha latte!  I can drink three glasses of those.
S V.}New York, NY}39}288}34}-1}4}9/3/2010}Phenominal, intimate atmosphere. I loved sitting here taking in the sights of the kitchen and looking at all the white tea canisters lined up. This is a really great place to go for a light bite and to catch up over a cup of tea.The tea is great. I tried the cold lavender mint tea and was very happy with it. I also tried the sampler of 6 mini appetizers and loved it. Oh, and an order of the appetizer bread basket! The appetizers were samples of various seafood, chicken and veggies served in tiny pots. The bread was fluffy and wonderful and came with olive oil for dipping and a strawberry butter spread, which was amazing and fresh.I was hungry when I stopped in with a friend who had been craving a visit. I'd advise against going there very hungry, as most of the selections are very light bites meant to be picked on as you sip your tea.There are two more substantial options on the menu, (set A and set B.). Which brings me to one of my only qualms. The menu is very vague and our waitress didn't know what was in my dish or the set my friend ordered when we asked her while placing our order. Neither of us is picky, so that was just fine, but I could see this being a problem for many people. Especially since her set A came with an entire bowl of (delicious as she described them) tentacles.There is a vast selection of dessert to choose from. And obviously, an extensive tea menu. As with most teahouses, you aren't rushed along and will  have to flag for anything you need, including a check.I loved this place and can not wait to go back. I think this would be a nice place for a date or a low key birthday party.
Ammy M.}New York, NY}1}8}6}-1}3}8/30/2010}My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for delicious food and decided to make a trip to Cha-an since it had pretty good ratings on Yelp. To be honest, this place was pretty disappointing. There wasn't much on the menu to choose from and the placement of the tables are very close so it would be kind of awkward to sit by other customers. However, what I favored most about Cha-an was it's peaceful environment along with the polite and sweet Japanese waitresses. The food portions were a bit small and did not really meet my expectations(also pretty pricey). If I were given the option to go back, I would rather grab some onigiris from the nearby sunrise market.
Nick B.}New York, NY}1}14}0}-1}5}8/30/2010}This place is awesome. The tea is, as one would expect, solid. The black sesame creme brulee is phenomenal. Their salmon toast is bomb. One thing I've noticed, though, is that in the three times I've been here in the span of about a month, their "toast of the day" has been the same (salmon). Don't get me wrong, it is quite delicious, but when one of the two toast-based items on the menu is "of the day," I would expect it to change now and then. Still, its good. Get the toast. Seriously. The most surprising menu item, for me, are the scones that come with the afternoon tea set. Granted that I'm not a scone connoisseur who travels the world in search of the finest scones, but I've never had a fresh, steaming-hot-from-the-oven scone before. Why don't other places do this? This elevates the scone from the dry, crumbly, is-it-stale-or-is-it-supposed-to-be-like-this obligatory coffee shop inventory to what a scone should be: steaming hot, moist, delicious. Kudos to not copping out by buying from Bulk Warehouse Scone Distributor Corp Inc. (NYSE: BWSD) like most coffee shops do.Added bonus: a (modest) selection of Japanese beers which aren't Kirin, Sapporo, or Asahi!TL;DR: Go for the tea. Stay for the scones.
David C.}Campbell, CA}85}413}14}-1}5}8/23/2010}I love this place. I think it was the highlight of our trip to NYC. The city can be a little too hectic and our vacation there didn't feel like a vacation at all. Cha-An was really a perfect place for us at the end of a ridiculously busy day and a vacation loaded with spectacular, over-the-top fancy food. First, the space is really nice-- not crazily cramped, very clean, very Japanese-y. We split a tea set / bento box thing which included some fancy green tea, tea-smoked salmon, 15 grain rice, lotus & eggplant, some tofu thing, soup, and a soy/mushroom quiche. Everything was seriously awesome, especially the quiche. What I really love about Cha-An is that all the dishes taste different. A lot of restaurants throw a bento box at you and it is the same sauce or the same ingredients or stock in it. Every dish had a nice, distinctive taste but managed to be light and flavorful, keeping in touch with the fact that you are drinking some gourmet tea. I think Cha-An reminds me a lot of food I get at home or make myself but wayy better. They should make a recipe book and sell it...to me. Come here for great service, great Asian comfort / homestyle food, and to just relax. Love this place.
Laryssa W.}Los Angeles, CA}405}279}91}-1}5}8/23/2010}I came here at about 9:30 on a Saturday night, when one of my friends asked me to join her and a few others for dinner. I had never heard the name Cha-An before, but it turns out that I've walked past the place many times. I was expecting dinner, in the traditional sense, but a delightful sampling of small plates and sweets would have been a more appropriate way to describe the experience.If you're looking for a substantial savory meal, you won't find it here. Cha-An's two dinner options come in the form of two sets: Set A and Set B. Each set includes a sampling of small dishes, dessert, and tea. You can also choose from a limited menu of appetizers.One of my dining companions ordered Set A, another ordered Set B, another ordered the soy milk quiche and miso soup, and I ordered the sweet potato samosas. I wasn't sure about ordering samosas at a Japanese tea house. My friend joked that our server would have to pick them up at an Indian restaurant down the street. But they were so wonderful. The dough was flaky and buttery, and the sweet potato insides were creamy, like the most decadent mashed potatoes you've ever tasted.I had a spoonful of my friend's miso soup too. It was by far the most flavorful miso I've ever had. The two friends who ordered Set A and Set B seemed to enjoy their food. For drinks - this is important at a tea house - we had a wide variety of selections at our table. I ordered the macha shake, a tall cool glass of green tea powder with ice milk, like a chai latte. I thought it was excellent for what it was, but it didn't appeal to my taste. One of my friends ordered a pot of blossoming tea. The floating tea bundles opened as they steeped in the water, creating what looked like a beautiful undersea landscape in her pot. We also had iced hibiscus tea, which tasted like flower petals, and a dark tea that my friend described as "the coffee of teas". I had a sip of everything and enjoyed it all.However, the scones were the highlight of the evening. I'm not sure exactly how they were flavored, as Cha-An serves a different type of scone every day, but they were more crumbly and soft than traditional scones. They broke apart like freshly baked muffins. The dough wasn't too sweet, but the crackled sugar on top added a nice touch. A small dish of (blue?)berry jam and clotted cream were OUT OF THIS WORLD. We all remarked on the heavenly texture of the cream. We liked the scones so much that we ordered another round, despite the fact that Set A and Set B came with their own desserts, which we shared around the table. I don't remember what those desserts were, even though I tried them, because I was so enamored with the scones. Must go back for the scones. Love this place.
Alex K.}Buffalo, NY}108}169}220}-1}3}8/22/2010}I went to Cha-an on a lunch date a while back.  My date and I were immediately impressed by the decor and the atmosphere, and we were promptly seated in an excellent spot suitable for the occasion.  The tea was good.The service was fantastic.But the food was terribly mediocre!  I don't think that I've ever tasted less flavorful eel.  It wasn't bad.  I didn't get sick, but I'd never found myself picking over eel before.  On a plus side, the dessert, though small, was thoughtful and well prepared, and the tastes were delicate and restrained.  Maybe I caught the staff of Cha-An on a bad day.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  I want to like this place so much, but the memory of that eel haunts me.  I may not be back.
Amanda Y.}Brooklyn, NY}43}32}86}-1}3}8/21/2010}I came here with a couple of friends to try out the tea (what else).  I ordered the afternoon tea set which included a pot of tea, mini-sandwiches, scones and cookies. I chose the chrysanthemum blossom tea and it was a very pure taste.  The sandwiches of the day were salmon and raspberry butter. As for the scones, I had earl grey and chocolate. The food and presentation overall is very good and well-done. And the decor is very relaxing. Plus: service is excellent and they are always willing to give you more hot water.Minus: the portions are small.
Jacqueline Y.}New York, NY}154}406}104}-1}4}8/18/2010}its delightful. everything is simple, tasty and clean. i came here with a group of 14 people for a birthday party at 11am. we had a private party and rented out the restaurant during certain hours. it was cozy and despite the rain, it was a wonderful brunch party. great to come with a couple girl friends or a date that can enjoy a not over filling meal. so cute.to be honest, i dont remember what i ate and it was a preset meal selection but i remember everything tasting great and the desert YUM
Lucie T.}Yonkers, NY}260}435}2}-1}4}8/17/2010}Very cool...Tea selection is nice.. Presentation is nice...Desserts are yummy... Ambiance is great... Service a little slow.. but friendly.Who needs more?I dont...
Naoko I.}New York, NY}2}45}0}-1}4}8/16/2010}Their tea leaf selections are amazing. I can remember how many kinds they have but all I know is it taste very good. I grew up drinking a lots of green tea so i can tell whether the tea is good or bad. I've tried their Lunch dish one time. All of the food seems to be very natural and authentic Japanese food. Also (here comes the best part) their desert is excellent!!
Steph M.}Long Island, NY}363}487}522}18}5}8/14/2010}A limerick of love, relevant to those who have been here: Cha-An I adore theeYou introduced me to black sesame You usually have a long waitbut your tea is greatand I end up leaving with such a clean tushy
Anna W.}New York, NY}152}315}40}-1}4}8/10/2010}Whyyyyy can't I give places 4.5 stars. Given that I tell everyone who visits about Cha-An, this should be something above 4 stars. 5 stars is generally reserved for awesome food and service. Service is cute, with tiny Japanese women with accents who do a pretty good job of explaining things if you have questions.If you come here on a weekend, you'll get to wait on the rickety stairs, as this is on the second floor. If you wait long enough, you'll start wondering about the domino effect and what it'd look like if you fell backwards. Fortunately, the time I came here with my cousin on a Saturday night, we "only" waited 45 minutes. Fantasies become reality after an hour, I think. With the bamboo and slats--but no sitting on the floor--the atmosphere is reminiscent of an authentic Japanese tea room as portrayed in the movies. What? I've never been to Tokyo, dagnabit. I've only had the dessert, in the form of the chef's dessert and tea. They're tiny and good, though not amazing. The green tea latte is standard. Really, though, you're coming for the unique atmosphere and a place to chill after dinner.
Alice T.}Redwood City, CA}435}1054}488}18}3}8/7/2010}The place is super cute. It was nice to just come here and relax with friends.The chef's dessert and tea was a good deal at $17. You get your choice of drink and a (rotating) 3-course dessert: raspberry mousse cake, black sesame creme brulee, ice cream with berries, and a macaroon and truffle. I wouldn't recommend the cold matcha green tea ($7)- it tastes pretty standard. Go for something you've never had before because they have an interesting and extensive selection of tea.
Wendy L.}Irvine, CA}341}215}155}-1}5}8/7/2010}Don't have enough money to fly to Tokyo? Come HERE!I was Tokyo last year and I don't think I even found such a great place as Cha-An. Everything there is very authentic and DE-LIcious!AND AND AND, you have to check out the woman's bathroom...Automatic toilet with the tushy washer! The toilet seat even goes up and down at the push of a button! So if your in much need of a pit stop in New York City and need a clean spot, I would suggest this place. Of Course, Don't forget to try all their teas and food. Their finger sandwiches are great and fresh! Please don't expect large potions of food, this is more of an afternoon tea places :)
C W.}San Francisco, CA}182}151}14}-1}4}8/6/2010}Great desert/tea place to hit-up after stuffing yourself with food on St. Marks. Very interesting teas and fusion Asian desert. I got some sort of desert sampler which was 3 deserts and a tea for $16. I really liked this place, like a fancier Japanese Ten Ren.
Wendy C.}Manhattan, NY}37}59}0}-1}5}8/3/2010}SUPER CUTE! Its just like you disappeared into a little japanese tea house.  I love their sets, everything is delicious and the presentation is so pretty.  Tea comes with each set and you can pick.  They also have different sets for each day of the week so you know what you are ordering is fresh!  The only thing is the menu is limited and its not a lot of food.  I'd say its a good place to go for afternoon tea or when you want something light. Oh and try out the bathroom it has those cool japanese toilets!
B C.}Boston, MA}1}5}24}-1}5}7/31/2010}I feel like this place deserves 5 stars just for the amazing Japanese-style toilet in the ladies room that has more functions than my cell phone.That said, Cha'An offers a good selection of tea, and the atmosphere is perfect for catching up with friends and lazy afternoons when it's too hot to stay outside. Though not a tea connoisseur, I am picky about quality and was impressed with the delicate yet strong flavor of my lavender-mint iced tea. I can't wait to go back to try out the summer lunch set.
Joyce B.}Nuremberg, Germany}309}474}39}-1}3}7/31/2010}this is strictly a review of their dessertsto be honest, as you can tell from my rating already, i was a bit disappointed by their desserts. we came here to get the chef's assorted 3-course dessert. i asked the waittress if she could let us know what's offered in the 3 course dessert and she simply replied that it'll be a "surprise". well, surprises are always so great. when i had kyotofu the other time, we knew what we were eating, and desserts were amazing. here, i think they were so-so. course 1) some kind of tea ice cream with thin sesame cookie - the ice cream was very refreshing and light. the taste of the minty tea was very strong, but not overwhelming. it definitely adds the kick though. course 2) earl grey tea mochi with chocolate truffle + puff pastry with cream - the mochi was interesting because it had the tea flavor in there. the chocolate was so-so. i liked the cream between layers of the puff pastry, but it was very amazingcourse 3) sesame cookie thing and jasmine tea macaroon - the sesame cookie wasn't very impressing, almost disappointing. the tea macaroon is probably the best part of the dessert course. it was very intense tea flavor but also amazingly sugary and crusty at the same time. overall, desserts were in extremely small portions and were not very amazing for what they're charging.
Lena N.}Washington, DC}35}130}4}-1}4}7/30/2010}My parents and I went to this place when we visited NYC based on the recommendations of my cousin (the local). Cozy place. The tea there was AMAZING. Probably the best Jasmine tea I've ever had or at least top 3. My parents (tea snobs) had different versions of Japanese green tea and they both enjoyed their teas. Very simple menu. The appetizers that come with the lunch specials were delicious, interesting and perfect for the ADD eater like myself. My mom had the salmon tar tar lunch special and the fish was so good. I had the 15 grain porridge and that was yummy for how simple it was. We got the Chef's Dessert Assortment to top us off. There was some green tea ice cream sundae-ish thing, a cream puff, and the black sesame creme brulee. All very delicious and not too dense or sweet. Service was friendly and fast even though there was only one server running the whole show. And as a side note, they have those fancy Japanese toilets that took me a while to figure out how to flush it. They also do a full on Japanese tea ceremony in this tea room they have but you have to make reservations a few days ahead of time so they can prepare. Overall, great place for a filling lunch that will not weigh you down. Delicious tea. I'd recommend it for tea and desserts.
Tiffany L.}New York, NY}121}1085}2}18}5}7/28/2010}how have i never been here before?? fiance took me here for a sweet date. we shared a dessert tasting for $16. Comes with 1 tea, 2 desserts, 2 cookies, and ice cream. Great deal considering each item by itself is around $7. we had the matcha latte as our "tea" which i thought was the best item of the night. Next came the ice cream (black sesame) with an earl grey macaron (my 2nd favorite item of the night) and a slice of orange pound cake. we also requested the black sesame creme brulee as one of our desserts, which was very good, followed by a panna cotta (not sure of the flavor).overall the ambiance was very serene and sweet and i'll for sure be back! this place is MUCH better than kyotofu.
Nancy Z.}San Francisco, CA}120}293}478}-1}4}7/25/2010}Great ambiance.  The place has a simple Japanese decor.  Perfect for relax and talk with friends.  They serve small appetizers as well as desserts too.  Love their tea selection.  The menu even has a brief history and map of where each types of teas are grown.  I like their cold sencha on a hot summer day.  My favorite is the chocolate souffle with raspberry, so good...
Katie J.}New York, NY}2}10}0}-1}5}7/25/2010}My friend and I stopped by for a late dessert, we accidentally almost went into the club next door and when the bouncer asked us for our id's we were like... what kind of tea place is this? But after we figured it out we made our way up steep stairs to the tea place. The atmosphere is beautiful with wood walls and little bamboo accents. We ordered to scarlet glow tea which had enough for two cups each and was 5 dollars, which is pretty decent. The tea was delicious and it smelled so good I just smelled it for a few minutes. I had the green tea truffles which were very bizarre tasting and very good. MY friend had the sesame creme brulee and said that while it didn't taste very much like a creme brulee it was the best dessert she had ever had. We'll be back.
Wan L.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}4}7/24/2010}A cute Japanese Tea House that have a "bar" area and a tea room for when they teach tea ceremony.This place is pricey, can be worth it. You can come here for a drink (they have a wide selection of tea and also alcoholic drinks), dessert, or lunch/dinner. What I recommend is their Sake Mojito and an ooolong Gran tea I forgot the name of. Sometimes I come here just for the Sake Mojito.Their dessert selection is limited, but delicious. The plated them very nicely, which is a plus. Each day they have a special for dessert and appetizers, which they will stop serving when it runs out.They have a set meal and a daily special. The set meals comes with a few side dishes and looks small in proportion, but are done so that you eat a healthy and right proportioned meal.Good place for dates and a quiet evening with friends or alone. Not recommended for families.
Adrienne L.}Manhattan, NY}27}74}69}-1}3}7/22/2010}Ordered the black sesame brulee... consistency was not of creme brulee. It needed more of the black sesame flavor.Also got the green tea rolls, very yummy! Good texture and liked the fact that it had a green tea cream center. ( This is why it's three stars and not two)I liked the sesame crisps that were used as decoration. Umm but $7 for an iced tea???? RIDICULOUS.
Caro H.}New York, NY}9}32}0}-1}3}7/22/2010}i've been to this place twice and had desserts and teas each time. they were all lovely. the servings, however, are ridiculously small. the $17 chef set (3 desserts, 1 pot of tea) really should just be for one person. the desserts are worth 2 bites each, and the tea, 4 cups. since i'm on a limited budget, the serving sizes especially peeve me. if you're loaded, you should keep coming back, but i'm not going to.
Kim N.}New York, NY}0}37}0}-1}5}7/22/2010}This place has a nice, relaxing ambiance about it. A quiet place to catch up with a friend or bring a date. I've recommend this place to a lot of my friends and they have all loved it. I've tried the set at dinner time, a few of the desserts, and their teas. All have been very good!
Siwei L.}Flushing, NY}84}20}10}-1}4}7/19/2010}The desserts here are delicious. Try their dessert tasting option. The teas are aromatic. Their other food items are also great. Always thoughtfully presented and prepared. The place is small and quiet. Great for dates or small groups of friends to catch up. They also let you stay as long as you like. Come, sit, enjoy the teas and sweets. Come on weekdays or come early. There will be a wait.
Mo C.}New York, NY}9}28}75}-1}4}7/17/2010}This is a nice place to have a conversation with friends, a friend or a date. Nice and quite.The deserts are great and light... I will recommend the Mint Mojito.The place is clean and unique. Love the decor. The restroom is also clean another plus!
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}4}7/14/2010}A really great spot to sit back and sip on some tea.  The prices rangefrom $5 - $15 or so for tea and that includes refills.  The desserts are about $7 or so a piece but are really good.  I strongly recommend their flan and creme brulee.  Neither are overpowering with flavor, but instead of a very subtle yet noticeable taste. So it's not the cheapest spot out there, but if you're stumbling around in the EV and want a different place to hang out besides a coffee shop or a bar, give this one a chance.
Albert S.}Seattle, WA}49}40}0}-1}5}7/8/2010}I love coming here to sip on some tea and do some reading. This place has a really nice atmosphere and the large assortment of teas couldn't get any better. It is somewhat costly, but oh so worth it.
May-chen K.}San Diego, CA}68}11}0}-1}5}7/6/2010}The setting of the restaurant is quiet, elegant, and neat.  My friends and I tried the green tea and white peony.  We also ordered mochi and green tea burlee.  The layout is pretty and they are amazingly delicious!However, I noticed one minor thing - when you speak to the waitress, you probably need to speak slower, so they can understand you better.  After all, some names of the dishes are spelled after Japanese, thus it might be us who pronounce them wrong causing the misunderstanging.
SK K.}Wilton, CT}174}233}341}-1}4}7/5/2010}A menu that appears in an ancient looking album, it can't get any cooler than that! A very neat concept. I was a bit hesitant when I first was asked to go there, A tea house?? I had been to Lady Mendel's Tea house which was an entirely different setting, but I took the plunge and decided to check this place out. There was some confusion as to where this place is as its not very clear from the outside, It feels more like walking up to someone's apartment, and I  looked around for a buzzer. Once upstairs, after passing through the traditional Cloth made door, that most japanese restaurants have, you can see the seating area and the counter.We were asked to seat towards the end of the floor, which is overlooking the street. The steas are mostly wooden chairs and tables, however there is one seating arrangement which was the coolest. It looked like a hut, with a bench that can seat two people inside, and other chairs were around it. The next time I go there, I am going to try that.The menu as I mentioned was an album, and a lot of detail is included on the tea's that are there to be offered. It was interesting to see, some of them had a label "sold out' next to them. We ordered a serving of "Scarlet Glow" and "White Peony". The Scarlet glow was hands down the better of the two and was really refreshing and had a hibiscus, pomegranati taste to it. At $6 for each tea order, it looked a bit expensive, but when it arrived the quantity was satisfactory, and our server refilled the White Peony about three times, so got my money's worth ;-)I have to put in a few words about the restroom. It was very COOL! very clean, nice art and a great sink.Overall a pleasant visit. I haven't tried the desserts, but glancing at the tables next to me they looked really good. The Tea selection is nice, the presentation is great and in reading through the menu, you may learn a bit or two about different Tea's
Alisa K.}Wellesley Hills, MA}0}56}1}-1}3}6/30/2010}Cute janapese place with a wide arrange of delicious teas. However, the servers are so clueless, and they don't really answer the customers' questions. We specifically asked for a pitcher of tea, but we somehow ended up with a single cup..Also, this place is slightly overpriced. Very tiny portions for what you pay for. Still, if you have someone to impress, this is an excellent place for some serenity and calm ambiance.
Susan L.}Manhattan, NY}313}420}670}18}4}6/26/2010}This japanese tea house is pretty nice. As you walk into the restaurant, there is someone there to greet you. The atmosphere is really relaxing. There is a small room in which you can sit kneeing down. The size of the food are pretty petite, but really filling. The multigrain congee is healthy and tastes good. There are many different types of tea in which you can choose from and if you don't know which type you would want to try, you can always ask for suggestion from the waiters.
Jasmine L.}New York, NY}62}62}2}-1}4}6/25/2010}i think the experience of this place outweights the taste of their eclectic dessert. it's a nice thought to be in the middle of the city and have an afternoon japanese tea. we had the dessert set sampler and ordered the tea recommended by the server. it was a great complement to one another and i wish i knew more japanese delicacies to try out other things from the menu. the service was great, server was readily available whenever we needed, and i want to go back to try more!
Serena L.}New York, NY}70}84}3}-1}4}6/22/2010}Great for a light meal, afternoon tea, or dessert. Or if you are me... all three! Great for meeting up in the afternoon with a friend, or just exploring a new place in New York. FOOD: I had the daily special, which on Sunday was Unagi Hitsumabushi Don with appetizers and tea. The appetizers was a side of pickles and a delicious lotus + mushroom dish. The unagi was yummy and the rice with seasoned to taste good on its own. A great deal for $10! I'm sure Monday - Saturday would satisfy just as well.  TEA: The tea that came with the daily special was Genmaicha, brewed with burnt rice and some type of tea leaves. They kept your personal teapot filled at all times so tea would be a part of every bite of your meal. DESSERT: I also got the black sesame creme brulee for dessert $7. DELICIOUS. i'll admit, the texture of the black sesame custard wasn't quite typical for creme brulee, but it you just think about it as yummy goodness with a glazed top, you will be happy. OVERALL: I would say the two highlights of ChaAn are 1) the wide selection of tea  2) the unique, japanese fusionized desserts!  I would say definitely come for the tea and dessert, and if you are hungry too, $10 is a great deal for the daily special.
Canny F.}Knoxville, TN}621}1563}6641}18}4}6/19/2010}Love the multigrain congee. The tea's were great too! This is the first tea house I've been to. I enjoyed it very much. The prices are reasonable.
Jenn H.}New York, NY}13}115}3}-1}5}6/18/2010Updatedreview}Went there again tonight for the millionth time and I must recommend their iced chai tea latte or iced sencha (green tea).  Their green tea is truly amazing--no bitter aftertaste and oh-so-fragrant.  I bought a 1-oz package of it to take home ($8) and am sipping on it as I type.  Worth every penny.  Service, as usual, was absolutely perfect.
Jack F.}Dallas, TX}556}1045}812}18}4}6/11/2010}You'll easily become a fan of Cha-An.  If you've got a small group, then sit at the bar and watch the kitchen staff (all Japanese female chefs during my last visit) dance around the kitchen like a kabuki theater.  Even the tea making process is a complicated process watching them pour water from pot to pot with timers going off every now and then.  Cha-An is a progressive Japanese teahouse serving both traditional and fusion dishes.  There are Asian-inspired desserts using western techniques like the green tea macaroon with red bean filling or jasmine tea ice cream with a sesame tuille. There are great menu sets like $10 lunch boxes or afternoon teas (with 2 sandiwches, scores, and tea).  If you've not nothing else to do, why not splurge on the $20 set with matcha and sweets or a $40 set, which includes a meal, matcha, and sweets.Oh, it's cash only so head to an ATM beforehand.  [Original Visit: January 3, 2010]
Carlie F.}San Francisco, CA}1101}427}194}-1}4}6/8/2010}this little japanese teahouse tucked away upstairs in the middle of st. marks made it quite a journey.  the host was nice enough to let us sit down even though they were closing soon.being a creme brulee connoisseur, i got to try something quite extraordinary.  their black sesame creme brulee lived up to its hype and was very delicious.  i wish the portions were bigger!cha-an also has quite an extensive tea selection.
Minnie M.}London, United Kingdom}146}310}31}-1}4}6/8/2010}I wish I could give Cha-An an extra star dedicated solely to the bidet in the bathroom.  I have determined after playing with its cleaning and drying functions, that I need several bidets in my life.I came with a friend around 8 pm on a Saturday night, and it was only at 15 minute wait.  Food was delicious!My friend ordered the $17 Summer Special, which included rice in cold broth, and some tiny appetizers that included pickles, boiled salmon, radish, potato salad, and a dessert of puff pastry and green tea creme.I ordered the $19 Bento Set B, which consisted of a soy milk quiche that I savored slowly.  The mushrooms in it were so flavorful!  Smoked salmon was good, and the soup was pleasant but not particularly memorable with its crusty croutons.  I loved the black sesame creme brulee, it was a wonderful finish to a satisfactory meal.The iced matcha tea that came with the order vanished before my appetizer even arrived.  Curse you, iced matcha tea, for being so refreshingly perfect.
Nancy L.}Bridgewater, NJ}114}309}309}-1}5}6/1/2010}Per other Yelpers' recommendations, my bf and I came here for afternoon snack/early dinner before picking up friends at JFK. We ordered the dessert set (6 assorted samplers), which included any tea of choice and we decided to go with the Sentra. On top of that, we ordered the black sesame creme burlee and lunch specials. With that said, here's the breakdown of my ratings:Service: 5 stars. There's unlimited water refills for the tea and the waitresses were very attentive in checking up on us to see if our pots need refills.Setting: 4 Stars. Cute decos and very cozy....but this place can get quite crowded. Dessert: 5 Stars. Everything was excellent. The set of assorted samplers was well worth the price and the black sesame creme burlee was simply awesome. Lunch: 5 Stars. Eel with mixed grain rice and side dishes (Asian pickles)....loved the rice and portion was just right for me. Oh yah, at the end, we even ordered the green tea matcha to go...very satisfying...will definitely go back again.
Jackie W.}San Francisco, CA}2}13}0}-1}5}6/1/2010}One of the most unique tea place in East Village! It is a little pricy but it is worth it! Their afternoon tea set was very good (all the sample size desserts were super delicious!!) I especially loved the scones. Strongly recommend to girls who want to have a relaxing chit-chat afternoon with friends. I definitely will go back there again when I get a chance.
Sumomo O.}San Francisco, CA}0}130}0}-1}4}5/31/2010}Go here for the experience more than for the food.  The food was good, too, but the experience was better.  I felt like I was in Japan with the atmosphere, good smells, bathrooms, and Japanese-speaking staff.  I ordered the special cool-broth rice with 6 items, tea and dessert for $17.  The rice, grilled mackerel, tea and dessert were excellent, while the other 5 items (in my case: konbu, salmon, cabbage, kabocha, ume) were fine but not remarkable.  Still, I would go again for the hour of feeling like I was in Japan.
Tessy M.}Astoria, Queens, NY}4}26}0}-1}4}5/30/2010}If you want to go to an authentic Japanese cafe in NYC, you should go to Cha-An. I had a lunch special and matcha there, and it was excellent. (Eel donburi was super good!!)I went there several times on weekend, and it was too crowded that I couldn't get in. It is too bad that place it too small!!
Muppet C.}New York, NY}7}52}3}-1}4}5/29/2010}I like Cha An.  The key word here is service, which in my instance was prompt, thoughtful and careful.  The tea was also well prepared and came in a variety of vessels depending on your selection.  What's not to like?  Agreed it's a bit on the pricey side (which is why it doesn't get 5 stars), but if it's your thing, reserving the authentic bamboo room for a tea ceremony would be well worth it.  I enjoyed my Hojicha :-).
K L.}San Jose, CA}21}62}0}-1}4}5/27/2010}YUM... sesame creme brûlée with marble sesame ice cream. Green tea Mochi was soft, chewy, and light. Great small place.
Paul L.}Edgewater, NJ}573}320}107}-1}3}5/27/2010}Guess I would have to say the place is nice.  I would probably give it a four stars if I was a XX and if I had some more cash on my ass but I'm not and I don't so three will have to do.The one word that comes to mind is gentle.  Gentle as in there's a quiet rhythm about the place that one does not want to disturb.  Gentle as in if I don't watch my big behind, it might knock over a table or two because the space is kind of cramped.  Gentle as in the waitresses are very quiet in taking your order and practically glide around the room.  Gentle as in there are candles on tables.But also, the one word that does not come to mind is gentle.  Not gentle as in, "Wow, this place is really nice" quickly followed by "Wow, I didn't know two to three bites of dessert is worth $12-18."  Not gentle as in, "Damn, my Lychee Martini was literally three to four sips.  Done."  Not gentle as in, I don't want to order another one because I'd rather keep my $15 instead of three more sips.  Not gentle as in I blew out the candle on our table by breathing.Quantity and price are in a very flat direct relationship here but what can one do?  Sometimes, one just can't go gentle in that good night.  Other times, one must rage, rage  against the dying of the light.
Jessica O.}Indianapolis, IN}51}69}75}-1}5}5/22/2010}What a cozy and adorable place! The Japanese servers are very nice and welcoming.Ambiance: wonderful; the place smells great.Tea: I normally don't even like tea THAT much but this tea was amazing! I felt like I could smell the tea... forEVER!Desserts: I'm a BIG fan of green tea desserts. And this place blew me away with theirs. The sake ice cream was surprisingly good too!They even have souvenir/gifts that you can buy and take home! If I lived in Manhattan, I would come here ... very often, without breaking the wallet. Desserts run over $8 and they're not very big. The teas run $7+ for a tiny pot that pours out just about 2 cups (you CAN get refills though). But boy would I love to take all my friends here to enjoy the aroma and sweetness (in every sense of that word) of Cha-An.
Myra C.}Sunnyvale, CA}70}193}1}-1}5}5/22/2010}green tea roll cake + sake ice cream. fluffy matcha roll cake filled with matcha flavored cream. not to sweet. not overpowered by the tea flavor. all in all a great mix. what blew me away was the sake vanilla ice cream served on top of a bit of red bean. RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME flavors. talk about loving this...the sake flavor was a bit off at first, but gradually the vanilla flavor would take over with a soothing aftertaste leaving me in a bliss. super impressed with this dessert and its creativity with flavors in general. black sesame creme brulee. never would have guessed the two could go together, but its actually black sesame creme brulee served with a vanilla black sesame ice cream. the sweetness of the ice cream does well to cancel out the goma. the creme brule base itself is on the creamy side. its good, but don't know if its a i-can-polish-it-off-myself-good-so-order-your-own good, but worth trying.  scones. freshly made. super buttery and flaky. i'm not a fan of it myself, but my friend ki-double l-ed it. choco and blueberry flavored. at around $8 a dessert its totally reasonably. drinks include: hibiscus tea, matcha iced tea, or a chai tea. good..but not insanely good like the desserts. but still...i LIKE. cha-an is definitely going on my list of NYC regulars.
Melissa W.}Bay Ridge, NY}96}26}24}-1}5}5/16/2010}Come to Cha-An to have natural revitalizing teas and amazing desserts.I am a non-frequent regular here!!! LOL. Allow me to explain, I come here on several occasions but not often enough to be considered a regular. Authentic Tea Room Rental.Its small but so serene. My friends and I decided to try it one day. They frown upon not making reservations first. It is a semi private room. It will cost you slightly extra to use the room but worth it. The servers were extra attentive (not that they weren't already so). It was just an amazing experience. The room had very traditional décor: bamboo strewn together dividers, wooden floors, and a traditional tea pot. If you are a green tea person like me, I recommend ordering the dragon well green tea. It has a soft mellow flavor, with a sweet fresh aroma. Absolutely perfect for those days you just want a warm and not a overly strong tea.Onto the desserts. Order the Chef's Dessert Assortment:you can choose 3 yes I know only 3!! From the choices of green tea truffle, ice cream, sorbet, chocolate souffle, or black sesame crème brulée. You must try them all atleast once. They were elegant, delectable, and unique.I will be soon returning for the tea ceremony....
Mike T.}New York, NY}72}261}0}-1}4}5/5/2010}I've been dying to come here for some time and finally had the opportunity to a couple weeks back. First off in terms of decor they don't come much cuter than this. Cha-An is like a haven for serenity on an otherwise grungy street-but my perception may be a bit skewed as we had almost the entire restaurant to ourselves (it was a bit early for dinner). That aside, the service and presentation here were truly exceptional and the food surprisingly good. I have to say I initially questioned the size of our portions but was more than satisfied with what was brought out. Definitely a great spot to come in the cooler months. Will be back soon.
Valerie C.}New York, NY}306}705}209}18}5}5/4/2010}I love how this place is tucked away along Stuyvesant Pl.Took a little long to wave down the waitresses but they're so darn cute and polite that I couldn't stay mad.My friends and I all got the Lunch Box special for $10. Came with unagi with a huge bowl of rice and their app of the day. DEEEEEELISH! After that we split the green roll & sake ice cream which was amazing as well. Everything was simple and felt really clean and healthy. They also keep refilling the tea for you in really cute tea pots! Extra plus!I noticed a lot of people got these green iced drinks around me, will have to try it next time. I think it's the Green Tea Matcha?
Lesie H.}Flushing, NY}359}576}260}18}4}5/2/2010}I got the Summer Special Set for $17 and choose Hibiscus Tea (the seasonal cold teas). The Hibiscus tea wasn't as sweet as I thought it was, more on the herbal side.The Summer Special included several type of cooked rice with some tapioca in a warm-to-cold clear broth (there was an ice cube in it). The sides were some miso fried tofu, octopus and carrots, seaweed, mushy potato thingies, pickled salad, and a pickled plum. I like the rice, octopus, and tofu, everything else was okay.The dessert was sakura ice cream in a cream puff with red bean. Yummy. I didn't get too sick (I need to re-evaluate my lactose intolerance).I'll totally go back again to try more desserts, and tea when it gets cooler.
Anna L.}New York, NY}4}36}0}-1}5}4/19/2010}Great atmosphere, very small and boutique.  I went with friends after dinner for drinks and dessert, which this place is perfect for. We ordered the green sake cocktail, lychee sake martinee (my hands down fav), and the special green tea cake/sake ice cream. Everything was presented artistically and tasted freshly prepared.  Price was $8.50 for desserts and $7 for drinks. The lines are very long since this place is tiny and people do tend to take a while chilling.
monica k.}Bayside, NY}0}52}0}-1}5}4/18/2010}green tea cocktail recommended.. although you will probably need about 10 of them to even feel tipsy. very interesting japanese dessert place. place is small but cozy and cute. and waitresses are all japanese.  girls, a perfect cute place to come and try with your gir friends and chat!
Poyz C.}Newark, DE}0}23}78}-1}5}4/18/2010}I'm also falling in love with this place. I went to Cha-An for a good tea and Japanese dessert. I love their Green Tea Rolls filled with super light green tea mouse. (A good happy-ending after my Takoyaki at Otafuku a few steps down on the same street). See you soon, Cha-An.
John Z.}Philadelphia, PA}21}140}21}-1}5}4/17/2010}You know that when a place has 231 reviews and it's still average 4.5 stars, there's something special going on. I don't think I can really add anything. So I won't! I loved it though!
Amy C.}Washington, DC}521}927}19}18}5}4/4/2010}One of my friends kept recommending this place. After over a year of him asking me, "Why haven't you gone yet?!" I finally made it today and now I will be the one asking people, "Why haven't you gone yet?!" I love their menu of food which I misjudged for small portions. I ordered the lunch plate (today's special was unagi don) and I had to leave half the rice in the bowl because I so full. The genmai cha (green tea) that comes with the lunch combo was perfect. I especially love the free tea refills. And since all the reviews I've found rave about the black sesame crème brulée, I HAD to try it my first time there. Now I know what all the hype is about and it IS a must try if you've never had it. The menu of teas is endless and I can't wait to go back again and again and again...P.S. They take CASH ONLY.
Winifred X.}Seattle, WA}243}672}121}-1}4}4/4/2010}I came here this past weekend and immediately fell in luv w/ it...  I am planning on coming to their tea ceremony at some point in the future.. -- not knowing what to expect, I ordered the pre-set menu set for $17, unlimited refill on "sentra" green tea (the mature one), and a full plate of small grain, salad, seared tuna pieces, and soup.... plus a small dessert.. I like the tapas style of a variety of small dishes... I will come back again next time for the macha-green-tea-latte, supposedly sweet twist on classical macha-green-tea..   =)Oh, luved the decor, the service staff wears traditional clothing, they are mostly real Japanese ppl and the place is decorated to transport you back to a century ago....   DEFINITELY coming back to this tea shop again.
Annie P.}New York, NY}40}136}47}-1}5}4/4/2010}Black sesame creme brulee    matcha green tea  go get them!!
Lan Y.}Washington, DC}0}95}0}-1}4}3/29/2010}Great selection of Chinese and Japanese tea. Excellent decor and atmosphere. Perfect for a date or a good conversation with a friend. The food is quite mediocre though and will leave you hungry after you've eaten it. Best to come just for tea and a snack rather than a full meal.
Jenny S.}San Mateo, CA}27}87}17}-1}5}3/27/2010}A perfect tea and dessert place.The one must-try item on the menu is the black sesame creme brulee. It's very unique, and I've never had it anywhere but here.  They have a lot of different desserts here that you don't usually find in one place in Japan.  Another item that I love is the green tea truffles.  The flavor is very intense, and it goes well paired with a bitter tea.Being the dessert glutton that I am, I usually get the chef's 3 dessert sampler menu.  My tea of choice here is the honey phoenix oolong.  A  lot of thought is put into the presentation of both the tea and the desserts. The cups are different for each kind of tea you get, and the desserts have a lot of small details that add a little something special.
Brittany H.}Santa Monica, CA}1037}631}254}18}5}3/22/2010}i like tea....but prefer coffee.  but if i must pick. within the realm of tea land.. definitely hands down Japanese and green.  Cha-An offers an exciting array of all kinds of tea: green, black, oolong... unfortunate for me, i was not in a tea mood... therefore, sparkling wine sufficed.  This place is like the gold to my sunshine, day or night.  night or day...cutting to the chase... i came here because a gf recommended it based on her 3 course heaven dessert here.  while i wasn't in the mood for such extravagance, my ears perked up in interest when i heard black sesame creme brulee.  this is probably my favorite asian dessert ever... so i decided this place was a must try. yum, yum, double yum!!  while the actual creme was my least favorite part, put it all together, with the black sesame chip crunch, textured black sesame ice cream, smooth creme...you've got yourself a sweet killer combo, without overkill on your sweet tooth.  dig it?did i try the jasmine ice cream? damnit, NO. but that just means i'll have to come back, now won't it?post review, i'm craving black sesame all over again. *sigh.
June L.}New York, NY}0}18}1}-1}4}3/21/2010}I am an avid tea drinker, so when I go to Cha-An, I go to drink Japanese green tea, which is excellent here. Their lunch menu is also very affordable and tasty. Reminds me of home food in Japan and a fancy tea house all in the same place.
Zi C.}New York, NY}88}26}0}-1}4}3/5/2010}This place is really cute!  I came here with my bf who complained thoroughly throughout the entire sitting (something about chick food not being satisfying.. haha, men). The bf does make a good point though, don't come here starving thinking that you're gonna pig out on tiny cookies, mini sandwiches and leave satisfied.However if you're craving a little bite, or some cute yummy desserts after lunch or dinner, this is the place to be.  I'm a big tea fanatic so most teas will put a smile on my face, but the choice I went with that day was the jasmine pearls (one of the green teas) which was pretty fantastic.
Lawrence L.}New York, NY}11}179}3}-1}4}3/1/2010}A little tea house with all the traditional furnishings. A mix of great desserts (molten chocolate cake) and plenty of teas to choose from make this a great after-dinner stop.
Izac H.}New York, NY}48}82}6}-1}4}2/24/2010}I met a girlfriend last night at Cha-An, it is a warm and cosy tea house, offering seclusion from the drizzle and traffic outside. It was our first time there and I must admit to being a little confused about what to order. As we were both on a detox, mine running strong at 2 days with a target end date of Friday, hers indefinite, we ordered some tea.I had the Green Tea Latte (7$), which was sweet, warm and tasty, little brown beans lining the bottom. My friend had the Macha, a green tea with a creamy froth, it was served with some sweet sticky ricey weirdness, which I kind of enjoyed. At $12 it was the most expensive there, both came in beautiful large ceramic bowls.Having just rushed from the gym I was really quite hungry but my friend wasn't so sure that we would really meet our dinner needs there. All around us people were eating cake, ice cream, custards, they looked delicious. My sugar veins were pumping, pupils dilating, my friend recognised the immediate danger to my 12 day beach body plan and arranged for a prompt exit. I definitely planning on coming back after my holiday and devouring a small childs body weight in cake, this place is as cute as pie, pardon the pun.
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}3}2/23/2010}Small, quaint tea house situated on the second floor of 9th street. Confused whether I was coming here for food or just a cup of tea. My date and I sat down and didn't have more than five minutes to look over the menu. Feeling a bit rushed, we quickly ordered anything that popped in our visual senses. When I asked our server for suggestions she just gave me this look like she didn't understand me. He ordered a green tea latte and I ordered the green tea matcha. His drink was a little too sweet for his tastes and mine was foamy and accompanied by sweet jellied candies and a teaspoon of red bean paste.  Both our cups looked like bowls and only 1/4 full. I was still a little confused for $12 if we would get a refill? By the time our waitress came back she asked us if we wanted anything else, but based on our language barrier and her misunderstanding us, we felt a bit rushed to exit the tea house and go for some dinner across the street at RobatayaNY.
Chris C.}Manhattan, NY}42}133}107}-1}5}2/9/2010}This is my favorite tea rooms in NY.  Coming into Cha-An is almost like going into a spa.  Right when you enter, the NY rush-noise-craziness just stops.  Being in here is an absolute soothing experience.  I've been here various times and each time is not a let down.  The place is quiet and easy for conversations.  The place is small but I think the quaintness is appropriate for the vibe of this place.They have a wide range of teas, and the menu is easy to read.  Depending on the tea you are having, it comes in a customized tea pot and cup.  They refill your pot with water once you run out.  If your hungry or want an accompaniment, I would recommend the food.  I've had the Cha-An set with Cindy C one night.... it looks like a little but once you start eating it becomes one meal.  I've also had some sweets; I would recommend all of them.  If you or anyone else is not really feeling the tea, they do have alcohol... for drinks they have sake and cocktails.Cha-An suites for multiple occasions whether if its pre or post dinner or with family or friends.  Cha-An is my NY escape.
Kris P.}El Paso, TX}204}201}592}-1}4}2/7/2010}My sweet tooth forced me to fall in love with Cha-An.This tea-house is my little haven in the East Village.Hidden away up a small staircase is a wonderful little tea house tucked away from the craziness of the St. Marks area. The items that make my eyes roll to the back of my head, and my mouth utter, "Ohhhh goodness" are their desserts. I almost always get the Earl Gray Chocolate Mochi, Black Sesame Creme Brulee, and the Chocolate Raspberry souffle. You just can't go wrong with those.It's a great place for a date - especially if you want to have more "intimate" quarters. It's small and cozy, and everyone talks in lowered voices b/c it seems to suit the place.The bathroom is famous for the toilet. But here's some info that might help someone - the door SLIDES open. Don't be one of the many who stands there and pushes at the door - only to think that it's occupied and therefore waits forever in the hallway with a leg stance that screams "I'm 4 years old and I need to pee NOW."Not that I was one of those people....Really....ok maybe.but i did NOT have the potty stance!
Christina M.}New York, NY}302}483}51}-1}5}2/6/2010}For $6 you can get to leisurely sip on a bottomless cup of green tea poured by a lovely tea mistress who encourages you to just keep sitting and soaking in the zen of the peaceful indoor tea garden. More importantly:  I've never experienced a bathroom like this before.
Kevin C.}Astoria, NY}5}5}1}-1}4}2/5/2010}Never before have I been so willing to spend $10 on tea. We came here for dessert directly after eating at Sake Bar Decibel a few doors down -- I guess we were feelin' the whole Asian thing that night -- and were pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere.It's true about the bathrooms. I didn't go, but my fiance couldn't stop talking about how cool it was. Also, the dessert was very classically French, which was a nice twist.If you sit at the bar be sure to stay away from the right side, by the door. It's right in front of a dishwashing station and you may get splattered a bit.
Nai W.}Flushing, NY}21}48}15}-1}3}2/4/2010}Nice little tea house. Offer traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Great Dessert.  Portion is extremely tiny. Versatile tea selections from different regions, but way overpriced for the quality they offer. Nice place to get lunch. Not a good place for dinner.  Fancy washlet toilet. Haha.  I wish they can change the lighting a bit. The spot light over my head is really unpleasant and a mood killer.
Daniel D.}San Francisco, CA}118}455}40}-1}5}2/3/2010}This place is the bomb for dinner.  Not because there are a ton of options (really, there are only two box sets), but because they give you so much delicious food for a really great price ($19 for the Box B that Allison H. and I each ordered)!It is true that the dinner food isn't mind blowing, life altering, or ground shattering, but it is definitely very yummy, and more importantly it's a good value.The selection of teas is very wide, and fortunately the waitstaff - which, by the way, is very nice - is able to help.The creme brulee, which Allison and I ordered _in addition_ to the desserts that came with our Box B's was awesome.If you have time for a single dinner in the East Village, I wouldn't tell you to come here, but if you're looking for tea and/or dessert, this is a great call.  And if you live in the Village, you might just want to stop by for dinner sometime.
Allison H.}Jersey City, NJ}312}575}9}-1}3}2/2/2010}Yelpers unite.  Came with Dan D on a Monday night after he repeatedly turned down my Otafuko suggestion.  We both got the Combination Box B and were surprised how much food we were given.  The tea selection is vast, and they refill your single serving pot multiple times.  We both had pre Yelped the place and knew the thing to get was the black seasame creme brulee, so we orderd that in addition to our 3 course meal.  Our watiress was confused, she reminded us that dessert already came with our meal, and we assured her we completely understood what we were doing.  The place was full, but not packed.  The waitstaff was nice.  The food was good......was it great, not at all.  But you can linger there, its serene.  The $10 dollar lunch specials might be a better deal.  Shout out to Dan who manned up and ate a lot of ice creamy desserts eventhough he's a lactose intolerant dude.
Jordan H.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}5}27}1}-1}5}1/29/2010}I'm not sure how tea quality and selection could get much better.  This is exactly what I was looking for in a good tea place.  Cha-An has a very good selection of a variety of different teas.  It's easy to stay for hours when they refill your tea pot.  The environment is friendly but small so you may have to wait for a spot.  Great find!
Momo R.}San Francisco Bay Area, CA}47}227}8}-1}5}1/25/2010}One of the many authentic Japanese eateries in the City, Cha-Am is a cozy respite during the dreary winter months.  Even though tea service is their specialty, they also offer a variety of bentos and desserts.  My friend and I split a pot of sencha and chocolate mochi balls (consisting of chocolate mousse enveloped by powdered sugar dusted mochi).  They savory and sweet complemented each other perfectly (a pat on our back), while the chocolate mocha balls were absolutely delicate and delectable (a pat on the establishment's back).  All in all, a great place to hole yourself away and indulge in goodies as it seemed that patrons are allowed to linger for as long as they desire even if the house is packed.
Linh N.}Brooklyn, NY}169}540}1462}-1}4}1/25/2010}Great for an afternoon tea to chit chat. Atmosphere was nice, wasn't too overwhelming with the tea leaves scent. The place was a bit tight but bearable, the jackets just makes it more complicated. I suggest going there in the spring or fall.Here are the dishes that my boyfriend and I ordered --Unagi Hitsumabushi Don - Eel on rice with shredded eggs on top. Besides the 2 pieces of eel on top of the rice, they are also mixed bits of it within the rice.Cha An Set B - 2 types of soup, tea-smoked salmon (which was basically raw fish), vegetables with mayo dressing, bowl of rice, and a quiche. Green Tea Genmaicha - tea leaves with grains of rice. The smell was strong, you can definitely smell the rice and the tea leaves gave it a nice combinationWhite Tea YinZhen Silver Needle - white tea, the taste was very simple and really soothes your taste budsBlack Sesame Creme Brulee - a must if you go to ChaAn. everything about it is black sesame, wasn't too sweet with the right amount of sesame seeds. The stop layer was crunchy was a smooth filling, sesame ice cream to top that off along with a sesame chip on top.
Jack L.}Union City, CA}18}358}23}18}5}1/25/2010}Most come for tea and dessert - and the tea is perfect for a cold winter night!  Well, here is a secret - this place is great for dinner too!   There are two set meals on the menu.  The food is delicious, and the 3-course meal is a downright steal for just $20!
Olivia O.}Los Angeles, CA}183}72}13}-1}5}1/24/2010}I love me some good tea and desserts. Intimate and warm atmosphere, with a zen bathroom I'd love to spend hours in...no joke! The toilet has all these different functions + buttons. It's probably one of the nicest bathrooms I've been to for such a quaint restaurant in the E. Vill. I instantly feel like I'm in a small Japanese village teahouse.The teas are always AMAZING, and I'm obsessed with their freshly made scones! Other desserts look delicious too. I love how they have such a wide selection of tea, with descriptions about each one.I never had to wait for a table. One of my favorite places! Absolutely adore.
Allison M.}Bloomfield, NJ}173}473}1}-1}4}1/22/2010}Pleasant place to go for a nice pot of tea and warm up on a cold day.  Nice menu, serene atmosphere, helpful wait staff and reasonable prices.  For a pretty authentic tea house, I would say this all makes it a win.
Kay Y.}Brooklyn, NY}7}9}34}-1}5}1/19/2010}my favor place to go for lunch... afternoon tea... after dinner dessert...I go there when I have nothing to do... I go there to relax...love their toast with red bean and fresh whipping creamtheir black sesame cream burlee? did i spell burlee right?errr.. one thing... I love I love from them....jasmine tea ice cream....light and the taste of jasmine after taste ... perfect... perfect ...why read.... just go try YO!!
Jessica C.}New York, NY}29}91}3}-1}4}1/18/2010}The spotty service was redeemed by the scrumptious assortment of pastries and gooey scones that come with the Tea Sampler ($17).  The ultimate dish was the still-warm-melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip scone, laden with huge morsels of sugar crystals and the "sandwiches" were tiny one-off bagel bites with raspberry butter and salmon with chives.The place has daily lunch specials that vary from Tuna-don to Salmon tar-tar-don.  (meat over rice).  But on the weekends, Chan-an serves unagi-don, with a spot of tea for only $10 until 7PM.  I will definitely bring an appetite for this deal for my next visit. GREAT date place, or TINY group.  The place is the size of my apartment (which is also the size of a dollhouse), but it definitely packed a punch.CASH only....lame right?
Jamia W.}New York, NY}246}88}7}-1}5}1/17/2010}Delicious tea and fantastic service. I sampled an amazing lavender mint tea and a green tea that brought me from a melancholy to clarity. The fancy Japanese toilet was an interesting treat--with a deodorizer, dryer, and cleanser included.
WeiKay L.}Flushing, NY}74}23}72}-1}4}1/14/2010}Love their yuzutini. Super refreshing! Perfect place to chat after dinner.
Tammie P.}Boston, MA}11}116}0}-1}3}1/14/2010}Cute tea house. Unagi donburi tasted very healthy and not fishy. The tea was great, but my favorite was the sesame creme brulee!
Jess L.}New Haven, CT}3187}4108}2861}18}3}1/8/2010}I came here for late-night tea with a friend. I was immediately charmed by the set up: intimate tables; cute, Japanese touches; a real tea room; and a smaller bungalow set up for one of the tables. The menu comes in a nicely bound, small binder with laminated pages. The tea pages themselves have tabs for different types of tea. Although the menu is set up to be quite organized, it's obvious that pages have been added and subtracted over the years, and all the pages have different formats and styles. I don't know why this irked me so much.Then again, the tea section itself was superb. There's a good selection but not the largest one I've ever seen, thereby not being too intimidating. I was sad to see so many types were sold out, including the type that my friend wanted, the cardamom chai. However, ultimately we were both pleased with our crimson chai and chrysanthemum tea, which came in their own glass tea pots. The tea leaves were steeped before being brought to our table, which might explain why it took so long to get our tea.The food that was served to the people around us smelled and looked so good! Next time...
Caroline C.}Kansas City, KS}63}201}113}18}5}12/29/2009}This is my first time being in a tea house, so this is a noob's review. ordered the white tea, friend had the indian black tea, and friend's sister had the jasmine green tea. We shared a plate of chocolate mochi. The tea was delicious. The chocolate mochi was a bit over the top, its basically a truffle wrapped in mochi. The service was superb. i would like to try their dinner boxes the next time i come.
alice y.}San Francisco, CA}41}57}0}-1}5}12/29/2009}What's not to love here?  It's tastefully decorated, the staff is friendly and on point, and the yumminess .. oh, the yumminess!They have really great teas here!  Also, if you want, they can serve it up in good tea service style, with the little pots/cups and the thin cup for aroma.  They tell you how to pour, and where to drain the water.  Then they leave you to steep the tea to your taste (I only got it right where I wanted it about 4/20 times, but it was still great tea every pour).  MMMmmm.  You don't have to, but it's a good experience, and you really get to appreciate the tea.One of my friends also amused himself heartily by pushing on the pot lid, making a little spurt of water come out the spout.  .. boys.Even if you don't want tea service, the desserts are also AWESOME.  Delicate and delicious, like everything else here (including the other drinks).  Something for everyone - we each had our different favorite, and we each enjoyed everything.I'm salivating right now thinking about it.
Jon L.}New York, NY}169}449}0}-1}4}12/27/2009}I have no idea how I've managed to avoid reviewing this place.  Probably my go-to place for dessert in the Astor place area (unless I'm in the mood for bubble tea).  Mostly I go for the decor, which as everyone has written, is really beautiful and cute without being kitchy.  Desserts are also delicious, and beautifully presented.  The truffle thingeys are awesome!!!  The tea selection is somewhat overwhelming.  Only thing I'm not particularly pleased with is the price, which is a little steep for dessert, but for the quality, taste and ambience, it's worth it once in a while.

Lisa M.}Brooklyn, NY}20}48}2}-1}4}12/21/2009}I liken Cha-An to a Japanese version of hot cocoa by the fireplace because it's just such a good place to kick back, relax, and take a break from the crazy wired world called New York. It's small, cozy, and best of all, it's on the second floor. You don't see people walk by the windows or hear people talking outside. It's just you and your friends having tea with some scones and sweets. We all got the afternoon tea set and the waitress was kind enough to place a small divider between our table and the next so that both conversations would be more private. The waitress didn't rush us and kept filling our pots with more tea until we were ready to leave. It's places like this that make me a fan of tea time.Ironically, if the place is full, it can be kinda loud, which sucks. Either way though, I'm happy they're getting the business.
Stanley S.}Kew Gardens, NY}10}48}23}-1}5}12/18/2009}You know... I have been to this place many many times... but i havent written any review for them... what a shame of me... because i adore this place... nice and quiet... great desserts... my personal favorite... chocolate souffle... the best chocolate souffle that i have ever had... the price is reasonable too... also, each day, they have a dinner set special... they dont have many set each nite... so order it quick... the waitress there are friendly and cute... =) it's a great place to relax and havin a nice conversation with friends... (please not too many cuz the place is small)
Y A.}Manhattan, NY}13}208}58}-1}5}12/14/2009}What a great place! Went there with a friend and we ordered the afteroon tea set. Their scone were warm and flaky. Other stuff weren't that memorable, but service is great. They don't care if you sit there and chat away. They were also great refilling my tea pot with more hot water. Awesome atmosphere! Would go back again.
Patrick C.}Milpitas, CA}9}68}0}-1}5}12/6/2009}We were taken by a local here and it was awesome.  It evoked memories of Tokyo and the tea houses there.  We absolutely loved it, quiet and distant away from the New York nightlife.  I love Japan, and this place really made my night.Some oddities - it is extremely hot in this place.  I had to walk out a couple of times during the meal to cool off, and the menu's were huge and kinda difficult to navigate without someone who was familiar help.  We got a combination dinner that included dessert and appetizer, and a choice of tea.  Food was awesome, included a bunch of different vegentables, fish, rice and soup.  I'm not even gonna try to say what it was, but the food reminded me of daily small meals in japan.  They gave us a varieto of desserts with mochi, different ice cream eclairs (vanilla bean and green tea), black sesasme creme brulee was absolutely YUMMY.Tea was served in a very unique style, in their own teapots depending on the type and when we were out, they were refilled.  Very leisurely pace in terms of eating, I think it was almost 2 hours before we got out of there, and price was very good.  About 20 per person before tip, great service and an awesome experience - highly reccomended for both locals and tourists (especially when you want to get out of those tourist traps)..
Sarah L.}Falls Church, VA}145}443}530}-1}4}12/4/2009}What a beautiful, intimate tea house! It's a bit tiny, but here you can find a wide variety of teas as well as desserts. They also offer main entrees, but we came here specifically for dessert.My friends and I ordered the black sesame creme brulee, the sake ice cream, and the chocolate mochi flavored with earl grey tea. I was surprised by the mochi. You take a bite into it, taste the dark chocolate gooey-ness on your tongue, and then the flowery perfume of the earl grey bursts in your mouth. I love unusual flavors like lavender ice cream, so I thought it was great, but if you are not a fan of non-traditional flavors, you may want to pass (especially since earl grey tea is usually not a favorite for most people). I tried my friend's creme brulee and thought it was delicious. I am normally not a fan of creme brulee, but back home there is a jasmine creme brulee at Teaism, and Cha-An's version tastes so much better! The sake ice cream was also light, sweet, and surprisingly refreshing. For tea, my friend got the iced chai (with chai-flavored ice cubes, a nice touch). My boyfriend got the Assam black, and I ordered the Osmanthus Oolong. The tea menu is extensive and offered a description of each tea and its origin. There was also a sake, wine, and beer list.Altogether, it was a bit pricey: it came to about $50 for the three of us, excluding tip. They only accept cash here, as well. Service was adequate without being too intrusive. It was a lovely experience, however. If I lived in the city, I wouldn't frequent it too often, as it's a fairly small space and is apt to get crowded. Coming here just for dessert and tea can set you back $15-20 easily. However, this place is adorable for a romantic date or if you and a friend want to catch up. It felt like you weren't even in the city at all.
M T.}Vila Antonina, Brazil}3}8}4}-1}5}12/2/2009}I LOVED Cha-An, for several reasons.1. Little maps of Japan to show where the tea was from.2. I loved the atmosphere! It was dark and cosy, and very Japanese, from the screens on the windows, to the menus, to the mini tea chamber. I loved its authenticity, and the sense of sanctuary, and the fact that we were completely surrounded by Japanese people.3. The matcha float was FABULOUS.  I think it has vanilla ice cream in it, and ice cubes made of milk and red bean paste, SO refreshing for a hot July day. 4. The bathroom was tiny and perfect, the toilet was a typical crazy gadget with 17 buttons that you have no idea what they're for. I enjoyed that little experiment. Apparently the men's room doesn't have such frippery, however, so guys, be warned.5. The prices were reasonable, the service was prompt and friendly. I would come here again in a heartbeat.
Diana B.}New York, NY}246}1601}44}-1}5}11/28/2009}Taken there by  a Japanese friend, I enjoyed the meal and the place immensely. But you don't, obviously, have to be familiar with J cuisine to enjoy it.
Claire L.}New York, NY}20}100}0}-1}5}11/25/2009}My friend took me there for a late night desert and recommended black sesame brulee. I LOVE it, and didn't feel guilty to go to the gym afterwards. It's well balanced between your desire and lightness~~I also ordered kenmai cha. my friend warned me that it contained a very high level of cafeine, but I ignored it since i'm a pretty regular tea drinker. oooo, wrong again, couldn't sleep until 3am. But still recommend it to everyone for an afternoon tea.The environment is also very suitable for old friends to catch up. Good service.
Stefanos M.}San Francisco, CA}64}84}7}-1}4}11/21/2009}Great tea!  Relaxing atmosphere! What more can you ask for at a tearoom?
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}4}11/20/2009}I highly recommend the green tea rolls with sake ice cream! GET IT! GET IT! GET IT! If they don't have it, like the first time I was there, don't get disappointed. Get the black sesame creme brulee instead!The atmosphere is cute. There's tea from different countries and dessert that are very presentable. They have lunch specials too!
Molly T.}Redwood City, CA}24}222}5}-1}3}11/17/2009}My entire Cha An experience took four hours because the waiter forgot to put in our food order. He was incredibly apologetic and brought us some free appetizers while we waited, but it would have been nice to have something taken off our bill or to be offered more tea with our meal. So, sadly, what could have been a tasty and pleasant experience turned into a marathon of fasting. So yeah, the service gets 1-2 stars. But I will say that (almost) everything I ate there was delicious. I had some honey oolong tea that came in a huge glass pot, and then the dinner combo that came with various types of fish and other small dishes (though one of them was a strange mystery substance I wasn't too fond of). And the dessert was the highlight: black sesame creme brulee with a black sesame cracker/cookie thing on top and a teeny scoop of ice cream. Delish. Despite the sub-par service, I'd go back for tea and dessert. Maybe not for a full meal.p.s. The toilet seat opens on its own! Maybe it's worth going to Cha An just for the futuristic bathroom experience.
Athena C.}San Francisco, CA}925}1562}681}18}4}11/16/2009}Never tried their main entree; I only came here for their dessert twice but twice is not enough for me. They have amazing green tea ice cream, chocolate souflee and yummy sesame ice cream too. It is rich and creamy and super flavorful. I also really like the atmosphere of a Japanese tea room. It is different from other Western establishment and it is cute for a date.
george t.}Long Island City, NY}8}171}0}-1}4}11/12/2009}this is a good place to eat and spend some quality afternoon time if you want light japanese food and also avoid the crowd on st mark. The tea house is very well decorated and well lit, not too bright and not too dark. They don't offer alot of variety in terms of food and deserts but all the items that they do offer are pretty tasty. Don't expect a big meal though because the portion are small. A good way to experience it is to order the desert set: 3 course desert and tea of your choice. This place have more varieties of tea than their choices of food and desert combined. the desert are good also, nothing specticular, and also the portion is TINY if you go with the course. The atmosphere is great though, I would recommend this place highly for afternoon tea especially if you want some place comfortable.
Nick V.}San Diego, CA}24}8}8}-1}5}11/6/2009}This place rules!!!  Very authentic and the green tea there is amazing.  Even the toilets and bathrooms are built to Japanese standards. Go there.
sarah d.}Brooklyn, NY}58}77}1}-1}5}11/4/2009}This is one of my favorite places in the city. Cha-An's pastry chef is a MASTER.Every sweet treat I've ever had here has been the best of its type that I've ever had.  And when I get the lunchtime tea set (which is amazing), every time I finish off one delicious little item and move on to the next, I'm pretty sure that whichever one I'm chewing at the current time is the best...until I take a bite of the next.Their scones are not only the best I've had, but the best I can even imagine scones ever being.  There's one that has a taste of almond and bitter chocolate that is CRAZYGOOD.I have multiple friends who are seriously addicted to the black sesame creme brulee, but even though I acknowledge its deliciousness, I'm more of a carby dessert girl myself.Now, the savory foods that I've had have been limited, since I can't come to my favorite dessert spot and NOT get dessert, but everything I've had has been good.  Admittedly, I once had a soup that was only "really good" rather than earth-shaking; but in my opinion you come here for sweetreats!Cha-an comes close to being absolutely perfect.  The only thing that could make it better would be if they'd make friends with Otafuku next door and offer up some takoyaki with that tea and dessert.
April Y.}Queens, NY}6}38}20}-1}4}10/29/2009}A bit pricey but the lunch special is reasonable and changes day by day."Today's Toast" is $10 but has a wonderful topping that also changes depending on the day (salmon is my favorite!)Their various choices for tea sets (choice of tea, meal and dessert) are fun! I've had the chrysanthemum, jasmine, matcha and orange pekoe tea (all recommended.)For dessert, try the black sesame creme brulee. The bidet toilet in the restroom is wonderful! There is a soft incense scent in the bathroom.
Alexis L.}Stamford, CT}0}17}0}-1}2}10/29/2009}it's all about the location. This place makes me wonder if they would do so well if they were placed somewhere else. I had tea, food & desert. Unfortunately I didn't quite enjoy any of them. Maybe I expected too much; considering I went to this place after reading Yelp's rave reviews. I witnessed the server putting my Macha latte into a microwave instead of steaming the milk. Result? just bitter and tasteless tea. ( I miss Amai Tea's Macha Latte. Why are they closed??)I don't have any remarks about their food or desert. They were just ok. Nothing that stands out. I liked the ambiance and all. But, I wouldn't return to this place just for the ambiance.(Oh, let me not forget that I almost tripped over the little rock pond they have on the floor. Safe hazard, I would say.)
Kacey K.}Philadelphia, PA}33}150}1}-1}3}10/26/2009}Very cute, but I don't quite get the overwhelming reviews.  It is tucked away in a cozy second floor space, complete with little nooks containing some of the tables.  It was unfortunately very hot the night I dined there with a friend.  We couldn't even think about ordering hot tea when we sat down.We both got the $19 pre fixe meal and while everything was tasty, nothing was incredible, and I do believe it was over-priced.  It was a good place to catch up with a friend and it was nice to do something different, but I was ultimately let down after all of the stellar reviews.
Yvette W.}Brooklyn, NY}79}313}240}-1}3}10/24/2009}Cha An is a small little second floor walk up with friendly service that comes with a smile. It's great for a romantic date or meeting up with a small group of friends to sample some Japanese desserts and a variety of tea. I had the matcha macaroons which were easily one of my favorite little snacks. The other stuff was just okay, and that's including the ever popular black sesame creme brulee. Not very impressed with it.
Jboogie L.}San Francisco, CA}30}2218}894}-1}3}10/20/2009}Japanese Tea House located upstairs on the second floor with limited seating (not suitable for big parties larger than 6 people).  We waited 10 minutes before sitting down.  We did not order real food but desserts.I got the $17 tea set with three chef choice desserts. I got the apple pastry with ice cream, cherry ice cream, and a chestnut roll cake.  Since this was a tasting menu, the dishes were small.  I got the silver needle (bottomless refill) tea. See my photos.Nothing really exotic that stood out to me.  The bathroom was a toto with a sliding door.
Andrew M.}Seattle, WA}123}24}0}-1}4}10/18/2009}My girlfriend co-worker recommended this, and we decided to give it a try.  Its very small and cramped, but as the winter season rolls in, its a cozy medium-priced tea shop with a quiet atmosphere.The food here is a bit on the small side, so while you won't leave hungry, you also won't be taking anything home.  While the food itself is largely delicious, the presentation really sets the mood.  Dishes are uniquely designed and of non-standard shapes, while the food itself is presented quite nicely.  In other words, I felt like I was in a restaurant where I would be paying twice as much as we did.Which isn't to say its cheap.  Expect to pay a minimum of $15 for a meal, and tack on $7 or more for drinks.  Speaking of which, I highly recommend the "Maccha Comfort" drink.  I loved it so much, I had to stop the waitress and ask her how it was made... I picked up the ingredients from the local grocery store that night and mimicked it.  Its so rich and creamy!They also have a great selection of mixed drinks, although they also tend to be on the small side.  Waiters were attentive and friendly, and combined with the tea house atmosphere, made for a memorable experience!
Terry F.}Queens, NY}26}40}14}-1}3}10/18/2009}I was very surprise to find a small little stairway that would lead to a traditional Japanese teahouse in the middle of East Village.  I shouldn't be surprise since some of the greatest japanese restaurants are also located around the area, but the teahouse is not very noticeable.  You could easily have past it.But if you happen to walk up those stairs you are suddenly transported to Japan.  The decor is astoundingly pleasant.  Their selection of tea will make you want to come back, and their petit dessert will make you call for seconds (I recommend the Black Sesame Creme Brulee ).  Of course, if you can afford it.  I won't call tea and pastry a dinner but the amount you will spend is equivalent to one.  Thank goodness for unlimited refills.This is a place only for tea lovers and for small group socials.  It is a very small tea house so expect the LONG wait.  Nobody leaves the place until their tea leaves are pulverized.  I tried to get a table three times and only managed to endure the wait once, and I'm a teacher so I know what patience is.
Aliya J.}Orlando, FL}243}134}53}-1}5}10/17/2009}I have been here several times, and just went again today. I love this place! It is so intimate and cozy. The food is fan-freaking-tastic! And the teas are phenomenal!Everything that Cha An does is simply perfect. I ordered from a set menu that came with sandwiches, sweets and tea. It was all delicious, but the mini bagel with raspberry butter... amazing! I was here with a friend for 3 hours! And not once did I feel rushed. I could seriously live in this place. LOVE IT!Btw, the black sesame creme brulee is scrumptious!Bring cash, because they don't take cards, and be prepared for a real treat. The service is spot on too.
Jen C.}San Mateo, CA}118}41}0}-1}4}10/6/2009}I thought I went to Japan when I got in.  The environment was so Japanese.  The bites were so tiny and the drinks were good.  I enjoyed chit-chating with my friend while I was visiting New York in late August 2009.  Good to try.
Ming T.}Arapahoe, CO}4}42}6}-1}5}9/23/2009}I love this place.  Desserts are some of the best I've had anywhere!  The tea sets are mellow and soothing while tasty and filling.  Service is superb.  very quite and zen-like atmosphere.  Great for dates!  Gets crowded so expect to wait weekend evenings.
G P.}Manhattan, NY}27}131}5}-1}5}9/18/2009}Cha an is a little oasis in the city.  Its so quiet and lovely and I could spend hours here if they provided me with a little napping area. The daily lunch set is a great deal at $10 and the quality is superb.  They never rush you out and the service is fantastic.  But you all know that already!
Allison L.}Laguna Beach, CA}394}130}55}-1}5}9/13/2009}Loved this Tea House! Order the Tea Set (Tea pot w/ your choice of tea, basket w/ salmon sandwich on fresh warm bun and fresh warm bun w/ strawberry butter, variety of small desserts and scones with devonshire cream and fresh raspberry jam).Went here for lunch. Small, cute place with a wide selection of teas. I ordered the Tea Set and loved it. Very good. The scones were delish! My boyfriend ordered one of the lunch specials, which he liked. He also ordered a really good sparkling plum sake.Good service. Our waitress was friendly and helpful.It's cash only...so make sure you are packing more than plastic.Overall great experience here. I will want to come back next time I'm in New York.
Alaine H.}Singapore, Singapore}661}286}358}-1}4}9/11/2009}The tea selection here is excellent. Sometimes service is helpful and other times difficult to flag the waitress down. I come here when I meet my nutrition counselor and we have a blast trying different teas. I like that all the food is homemade and you can find healthy options (as well as unhealthy options) in the menu. I have also had their afternoon tea set and I can safely say that one set is enough to feed two (unless you eat a lot or starving). Definitely try the dark chocolate truffle mochi, it is ultimately sinful and delectable.
Laura A.}Brooklyn, NY}234}342}1228}-1}5}9/11/2009}I don't know if this is real, meaning if a Japanese Tea House has to be like this or if they just recreate exaggeratedly the Japanese topics... but if all this is an illusion.. just let me dream. I get totally enchanted with Cha-An... starting with the deco to the ambiance, the service and finishing of course with the Tea. And holding my daily Genmaicha cup of tea I appreciate even more, if that is possible, the one that I had at Cha An. GENMAICHA green tea. Coming in a small and modern teapot with an intense Rice scent that rapidly fill the table. We also order the Flower Craft Tea, which is not a tea that I'd order again because my personal taste, but it was really really good.. and gorgeus. Coming in a transparent jar with a huge fuchsia Chrysanthemum inside.  For those loving Jasmine Tea, is the one to try. Something common for both teas was the delicacy and intensity of the flavor. Ok, its a Tea House, they should be as good, but we all now that words are words and facts are facts.They also offer a small selection of sakes, cocktails, wine and beer, for that ones that prefer something stronger. Small but a well studied variety. Add to this different food sets, very interesting, coming with your choice of tea including some dessert sets. With a price, that for what I have see, is more than reasonable. Coming after dinner I couldn't think about to eat a bit more.. except for the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. We were 3 people sharing, it was enough, and I was surprise again with the delicacy and intensity of the flavors. The black sesame was a little weak for me, tho. 3 layers, 3 flavors, 3 textures. The best way to completely enjoy it was to fill my spoon from bottom to top; and so you get the trilogy at the same time...and then refill, refill and refill...what else to add? you can imagine: extraordinary service, well I have to say it was a little slow, they are busy.. this time was on Friday night, 10:30pm and almost full. The ambiance relaxing, perfect for friends talks and the deco.. just I'd like to copy that room for my place; What else... Definitely, I'll come back... because the Genmaicha, because many others teas; for the ambiance; because the Creme brulee, because many other sweets; for the food.... and I didn't tell anything.. .but for the bathroom... and for the Japanese Tea Ceremony
B B.}Jersey City, NJ}0}38}1}-1}4}9/8/2009}Charming little Japanese teahouse with Yummy desserts and great tea! Can get pretty packed on weekends.
Kristen A.}Oregon City, OR}304}54}1}-1}4}9/7/2009}Ooooh!  I really enjoyed my entire experience here, even down to the lovely japanese toilet in the bathroom!  The tea, the service, the food, the ambience made it a definite new favorite for me.
YooY W.}New York, NY}856}27}39}-1}4}8/31/2009}List:  Sweetiesyelp.com/list/sweeties-n…Ever look for that slightly more sophisticated than Starbucks scene to play catch up with your good friends? Cha-An Teahouse offers just that sort of sought after ambiance. Offering a cozy, classy touch, you can enjoy the small, tasteful Japanese snacks or their fragrant variety of tea.While I've passed by this place dozens of times on my way to show apartments in the East Village, I had always been curious about what this teahouse had to offer, but not enough to ever step foot. Too bad I lacked much of an appreciation for tea because it is here that I found that they serve zenzai, one of the food items, the other being wafuu hamburger steak, that I have been craving ever since coming back from Japan.Zenzai is a type of red bean soup commonly served cold or warm as dessert in Japan. Certainly we can find red bean soup in many Chinese restaurants, but those dessert items are quite plain. Zenzai offers more than just red bean soup. It usually includes ingredients such as ice cream, shiratama (mochi), fruit, shaved ice, and condensed milk. Yeah, may not have been the best made zenzai or seem all that complicating, but I'm glad to finally get another taste of Japan that I have been desiring for a long time.It's a great place for an original dessert tasting menu, socializing, or enjoying the aromas of tea.
James F.}Brooklyn, NY}291}295}280}18}4}8/25/2009}Cha-An = the other reason you need women in your life. Tea and dessert is not a typical guy activity. Cha-An is a wonderful experience so guys find a date, relative or female friend/co-worker and go.The tea choices are plentiful if a bit overwhelming. There must be 6 or more pages of different tea's available. Thankfully there are descriptions which seemed accurate; the hojicha tea I order was strong and not bitter; just as described.My preference in desserts usually run more towards fruit-based sweets (tarts, pie, etc). So I was very pleased and surprised how much I liked dessert items here. Safe bet go for anything green tea based. I loved the green tea macaroon (very soft) and the green tea swiss  roll.The chocolate mochi and cookie were okay but too rich for me. I liked black sesame creme brulee, but was not blown away. My dining companion was  pretty  fond of it.Decor doesn't usually phase me unless its disgusting or unique and or beautiful.  Cha-An definitely falls into the latter. Does it feel like Japan? Don't know, I've never been. It looks like the Japan I've seen through Kurosawa and Anthony  Bourdain if that helps. It's a small space but they decorated it beautifully.Service was excellent and 3 course dessert for $17(cash only, no CC) is pretty reasonable.
Melissa Z.}New York, NY}204}117}81}-1}4}8/19/2009}I want to live in that teeny tiny bamboo house, with a black sesame creame brulee in one hand and a teapot in the other. Mmhm, that'd be the life. We both had the Chef's Dessert Assortment ($17 = 3 dessert courses + your choice of tea). I wanted to try the famous Black Sesame Creame Brulee, but wanted the chef's menu. The waitress suggested that I put in a request for that item to be part of my tasting, which the chef complied with. + star for being so accommodating. Between the two of us, we got: Ice Cream: - Mixed Fruit Ice Cream- Green Tea Ice Cream Mini versions of: - Green Tea Swiss Roll- Flan in azuki bean- Black Sesame Creame Brulee- Chocolate mochiCookies: - Green Tea Macaron- Chocolate cookieTeas:- Hojicha- Flower Craft Tea I definitely recommend the Green Tea items. All of the desserts were made with a light hand in sugar, so nothing was too cloying. To me, the creame brulee was the standout dessert, but my companion loved the swiss roll too. The chocolate mochi was the weakest, with a super soft mochi shell but a cold, stiff dark chocolate interior.  The Flower Craft Tea has flowers that blossom beautifully inside the pot.Go there, chat, enjoy a relaxing evening. And don't disturb me inside my bamboo house.
Mr. Met s.}Stony Brook, NY}78}346}513}-1}4}8/15/2009}Small, but very pleasant place. Friendly service. Went on saturday around 1pm, was nearly full. (small, about only 17 seats total. located upstairs)Had the eel with rice saturday/sunday special for 10 dollars which included 2 tiny side dishes(sweet vegetables and some potato/corn mash potatoes?) Added three dollars to include a dessert. (Must warn you, it's randomly picked - u don't know what dessert u will be getting.)The rice was very good - a high quality rice. Also comes with shredded eggs and basil like leaves. Must warn that the portions are small, especially the dessert. But the sesame cream brulee was just awesome, a small scrumptous creamy scoop on top of a iced layer which stores juicy sesame pudding.(They sell a larger one for 8 dollars) Comes with a delicious sesame cookie. My other dessert was a strawberry cake type. Pretty good too.Definitely a gem, but not for the buget concious. So just come here occasionally.
Jacob L.}San Francisco, CA}17}169}0}-1}5}8/2/2009}This place looks like it could be in Tokyo, and that's also what my Japanese friend said about it. "I feel like I'm in Tokyo!".The service is friendly (as it should be, given the Japanese "customer is god" idea). They have a great variety of teas, interesting pastries, everything is made there (as can be seen by the huge kitchen in the back), and they also serve savory foods, which looked delicious although we didn't try them.  I wish they were open for lunch!
Leon C.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}128}57}71}-1}5}7/28/2009}I *love* this place's decor, it is a zen tea house with an intimate flare. Great for dates.They have a huge selection of tea so if you hate tea, you should still come for their dessert! (They do have one or two coffee if you *really* want - but go try a tea there!) I personally love the green tea with the rice grain, I love the smell of it. They also started serving food so if you're in for a snack, this place is great for that.I've had several of their dessert, they're really good. First of all, that Black Sesame Cream Bruelee is to die for. Not only is the dish dressed up nicely, the dessert was amazing. I've also had their sampler and I liked most of them. At another time, I had their chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce - which I thought I would hate because of the sauce. The sauce came in a separate tube which was really cute and I could control the amount - that made me very happy.Now, the price is a little bit up there, but it is totally worth it for the atmosphere, the friendly service, the kick-ass dessert and lovely tea that they refill for you.Speaking of tea refill - if you get a teabag/herb tea, you won't get any refill, it comes in a big pot. If you get the real stuff, it comes in a little pot with tea leaves (traditional) and they will refill water for those since the leaves will probably give you about 3 cups before it loses its taste and strength.Awesome ambiance, friendly staffs, amazing dessert, great selection of tea to go with it.
Joe C.}Forest Hills, NY}5}219}3}-1}3}7/26/2009}The perfect ending to a perfect date:  the most authentic & true Japanese desserts ever.  A lovely place... And the cocktails are great too!
Sean S.}Manhattan, NY}743}1655}34}18}4}7/22/2009}Tea tea tea, and more tea.  They have a good selection, and a food menu too.  What you'll remember most besides the flavors in your mouth, is the decor of the place...  cute, quiet, comfortable, intimate even.
Cindy C.}New York, NY}78}287}0}-1}4}7/18/2009}A solid 4 stars.When my friend suggested this place for dinner, I was skeptical, maybe because there were only two choices for dinner- I was sort of wondering if it'd be like a fastfood joint, but with even less choices. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was absolutely delicious- all the courses were light, but by no means were they not filling. I loved the soy milk quiche they make here. I almost wanted seconds.If you're here to check it out, I suggest dessert and traditional tea. The staff was so friendly, constantly refilling my teapot and asking if i needed anything else. My only regret is that I was too full to have more than 2 bites of the wonderful dessert, so I shall be returning again. SOON.
Mimi F.}New York, NY}1}14}0}-1}5}7/18/2009}I think everything are so wonderful and specially how to serve these teas. If you have someone who is so intimate with, you should take there.
Hamid E.}Brooklyn, NY}29}23}9}-1}5}7/16/2009}This place is almost a hidden gem. Of course you are not going to think that with amount of reviews it has received. But because it's actually on the second floor and the entrance is just a little door leading upstairs, you might miss it all these years, like I did.My friend Ty pointed out the tea house. I loved it at the first irasshaimase! I had my fave genma cha and sesame creme brulee this first visit and some hot and cold sake the second. The atmosphere is soothing and it'd be actually a nice place for a low key date.
Jewel Y.}New York, NY}121}767}3340}18}5}7/10/2009Updatedreview}5 stars for Cha-An's 3 course desserts!!! It's $16 and loved the variation of delectable and eclectic sweets! It's a nice mix of Asian and European flavours, everything is very beautifully presented and you get to enjoy them with a complimentary tea of your choice. I loved green tea scone! The menu changes all the time so I've gotta go back again and again to get indulged in my sweets heaven! Mmmmm!!!I also recommend matcha latte! So good!!!!
GarGuPi L.}Flushing, NY}81}493}1452}-1}4}7/5/2009}Keep in mind that you dine in Cha-An for the serenity, the sweets, the "toilet" experience and the great customer service and you would have a great experience. Every restaurant has its own sweet spot(s), so don't get too disappointed if you ordered something the chef isn't a specialty in. So when you come to Cha-An, of course you won't be wow by the set meal. They're just the cream on the top to the picturesque desserts concocted by the visible chefs behind the counter.  I wish they had a larger savory section, but then again, that's not what the chefs want to focus on and I respect that.  The weekend lunch set features the unagi don that comes with a small dish of appetizer (based on the chefs' mood), some pickles and unlimited refill of genmaicha.  As always, don't expected large portion at authentic Japanese restaurants, but you would be satsified by the high quality.  For $3 more, you get to enjoy a dessert set! Now here's the perplexing dilemma of mine. I really wanted my companion to try the infamous black sesame brulee (equivalent to the blueberry pancakes of Clinton's Street Bakery), but because it's an 'attachment' to a lunch set, I couldn't choose my choice, but rather succumb to the chef's choice.  Hmm...should I serve this customer ice-cream? Mochi? Roll-cake? Or brulee? If I wanted to save myself $5 (regular dessert is around $7 each), my sweet tooth is inevitably dictated by the chef's frame of mind. Ahhh!!!!!!  But the waitress did inform me that I get to eliminate a choice (kind of like using a lifeline in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire), so I opt out of ice-cream because I can get that anywhere really. I wanted to taste the chef's labor of love. So with ice-cream out of the picture, I hurried my companion to finish up her eel so I could find out what the chef wanted us to eat! Other diners received ice-cream, roll-cake...so what did we get???................da suspense.............It was....the chocolate roll cake with stewed strawberries!!!Not black sesame brulee, but the cake was so beautifully set and mastered, topped with a sprinkle of snowy powdered sugar.  It was a beautiful site. The waitress was really sweet as well. Very polite and we struck a short conversation even though I'm not Japanese. I've to admit though...since my income is so low right now yet still wanted my companion to try this teahouse, I didn't order anything, but drank her tea; however, the waitress was still kind enough to keep giving me refills.  No unfriendly eye stares or smirks.  And another thing...I don't have a sweet tooth, but I would gladly fork over $10 just to sit there with a plate of beautiful dessert and a cup of tea sitting in front of me.  Then, I'll doggy-bag the cake for someone I love. Yes, I pay for the atmosphere and share the flavor with another one.I'll come back for sure - to chat with friends, to just feel like being in Japan again, or just to feel respected as a diner, even if I could only afford a cup of tea.
Eva G.}New York, NY}144}688}465}-1}4}6/17/2009}$17 for a teapot of grass tea, and a 3 course dessert. Tastes are not overpowering, and very simple and light. Nice place to go after a moderately sized meal. The sakura ice cream was great. The restroom has a bidet; that was pretty hot.

Madhu R.}Washington, DC}89}625}23}-1}5}5/28/2009}Awesome teahouse in East Village!  Atmosphere is great for a date, or to just have a quiet afternoon tea.  On Fri/Sat night, it's great to see the crowds of native Japanese people.  Also, I spotted Famke Jansen there once....I think she lives on tea alone.
Meesh C.}Irvine, CA}21}29}33}-1}5}5/27/2009}Just like the tea shops I visited in Ginza on my Japan trip.  Only had dessert and tea here.  The black sesame creme brulee topped w black sesame icecream alone is worth going out of your way to visit this place, waiting for a table, and it's high price tag.  The delicious variety of teas are an bonus. The bathrooms here made me feel like I was back in Japan, not in dirty Manhattan. I actually made the trip to Cha-An after reading yelp reviews about the black sesame dessert. I was on a mission to find black sesame desserts after falling in love with black sesame cake in Ginza and soft serve in Kyoto when I was in Japan (had it on my first day in Kyoto and everyday thereafter).  Found it on the dessert menu at Sakagura, and then again here at Cha-An. (Chinatown Ice Cream factory has black sesame flavor also, but it is a major fail!). I love Cha-An because I can come here just for the dessert, which is the only reason I ever even eat dinner to begin with. Score!
Weili H.}Houston, TX}158}56}44}-1}4}5/27/2009}Here's the thing about this place, the decor seemed authentic (I'm Taiwanese though) and everything about this place screams peace and tranquility. I could tell walking in this place might burn a hole in my wallet. Definitely not of the cheap-eats variety.We went there for lunch and ordered their lunch special rice bowls. The salmon tar tar was good, and the rice was filling. The appetizer dish was a little strange as we didn't really know what it was. The real charm of this place was with the dessert. We ordered the Earl Grey Chocolate Mochi and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. They were both amazing. Probably the best and most unique desserts I've had in quite sometime. If you can only choose one I'd go with the Black Sesame CB as it's probably unlike anything you've ever had.
Kat L.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}5/17/2009}simply divine. charming spot for a couple/small group of girlfriends to sit and chat. i went with a  girlfriend to catch up, and we chatted for hours over the afternoon tea set ($18) and chocolate mochi ($7).the tea set is enough for two, if not super hungry. (actually think it would be a bit too much for one?). ours came with two mini sandwiches (each about half-size of my fist; one was raspberry and cheese, the other salmon), two scones, a slice of pound cake, a financier, and a green tea macaroon with red bean in the middle (like an oreo). we chose a pot of macha green tea, which they refilled with hot water after our first pot, and the balance was excellent. five stars especially for the scones that were warm and buttery, nothing like the typical american bakery scones. they came with a cream and raspberry jam. everything was fresh and delicate. the mochi, also five stars, had the perfect gumminess/chewyness and were not floury at all. the chocolate-green-tea filling had an excellent balance between the sweetness of chocolate and the fragrance of green tea.   very small, authentically japanese setting. a bit pricey perhaps if you want to go every day, but still highly recommended for a once-in-awhile visit. :)
Jeremy S.}Manhattan, NY}13}50}0}-1}5}5/10/2009}Wonderful place. We had the black sesame creme brulee, a cup of hojicha, and a cup of genmaicha. Attentive waitstaff and warm atmosphere. Looking forward to a return visit.
Akiko T.}Los Angeles, CA}1294}228}102}-1}5}5/2/2009}This place is such the quaint, quintessential Ginza / Minami Azabu tea shop relocated to Manhattan.  I think everything about it is absolutely, tastefully gorgeous.  Try to get the 4-top "cabana" located in the middle of the restaurant!  It's the quaintest thing on the planet.I ordered the macha tea which was appropriately perfect and dreamy and shared the Black Sesame Creme Brulee which came topped with a Black Sesame Ice Cream.  They also brought us some complimentary mini kinako mochis.  I was salivating over the toast the people were ordering next to us that came topped with Azuki & Ice Cream... but decided I really don't need to be eating that.
paul c.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}4/27/2009}love it. the food is tasty, clean and fun to eat. all the deserts are nice but the sake ice cream is ridiculous. im in love.if you love tea and can appreciate it properly, this place is for you. the variety and presentation are spot on.the setting is great. atmosphere fits the food as best it can in Manhattan i suppose.service sometimes is lacking but the food, tea and dessert make up for it. sitting at the bar makes the service much better.
Tommy L.}Los Angeles, CA}223}115}6}-1}5}4/24/2009}Words alone cannot describe how much I love this place! I knew, deep down, that our serendipitious encounter was meant to be :) The three course dessert item is the perfect finale to an evening date either with someone of romantic interest or just friends! Also, the bathroom's decor is out of this world! So tranquil and unbelievably clean.
Jamay L.}San Francisco, CA}50}34}7}-1}3}4/22/2009}Alas, this was one of the few times my high-expectations-due-to-rave-Yelp-reviews led to disappointment.Because of the long lines outside Chickalicious, my boyfriend and I decided to get dessert at Cha-An instead.We ordered the caramel apple cake and the sesame creme brulee. Both were beautifully presented but tasted just OK. There was a funny taste to the apple cake that neither of us enjoyed, and the creme brulee, while interesting, didn't really taste like creme brulee. It didn't help that they were both pretty overpriced.Maybe we just craved chocolate. Or Pinkberry.The tearoom atmosphere was cool though, as were the funky menubooks, crammed with interesting tidbits about tea and Japan and tea in Japan. I don't think I will go back though, given the excellent array of dessert and late-night food options in the area.
Trina M.}San Francisco, CA}2082}139}456}-1}5}4/15/2009}OMG !!! I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE !! I wish they had it in San Francisco too. I came here twice while visiting NYC. My first visit was during the day and I'd ordered their Chef's Dessert Assortment $17 with Chrysanthemum Blossom Tea. It came with 3 different desserts. One was their Ice Cream, second Fudge Cake & Sesame Mochi, and their thier dessert was Chocolate and Green Tea cookies. Service - Okay~My second visit we came here during last evening 7-8ish~ We ordered their Green Tea Truffles $6 , Chocolate Mochi $7, Jasmine Pearls Tea $6 , & a small bottle of their sparkling sake. ^ ^ Service - Excellent ! Our waitress checked up on us and refilled our tea ^ - ^ sweet !I really like how it's cozy and relaxing. You can enjoy a nice coversation with someone/friends without having too much around you and their tea and dessert are so yuMmy ~!! LOVE IT !! ^ ^ I wanna go back !! ahaha [ NOTE: Photos Posted !! ^ ^ Check them out !! =D ]
Yumi A.}New York, NY}33}136}15}-1}4}4/13/2009}I love this cozy tea house and need to go there more often!! I've come here twice for desserts and tea, so I have no idea how good their food is. But their black sesame creme brulee and scone duo are both sooo good. Their scones are baked fresh and are the perfect size. Why don't more bakeries make earl gray flavored scones?! Their selection of teas is also pretty large, and it's fun trying new flavors. I personally love the chai :)
Sophia C.}Los Angeles, CA}49}52}4}-1}4}4/9/2009}Pre-recession Sophia would have given this place an immediate 5 stars - paying too much for fairy-sized food was my thing.But now that my money has left with the stock market, this super Japanese teahouse gets 4 stars for serving pound cake slices the size of my index finger.  And I have little Chinese girl hands.My 'mo and I ordered the afternoon tea set (he chose jasmine pearls [a green] as the tea and it was magnificently fragrant).  We also got:a hibiscus and elderflower tea with a Red Something name that he said sounded dirty (I discovered I don't like stevia at all and the tea was a bit to sweet for my taste)"dim sum", which turned out to be 3 each of tiny tofu roll and pork shui mai (as tender as the filling of a Shanghai dumpling)the special: shrimp and lotus root with mustard sauceIn addition to the aforementioned finger cakes, the tea seat also consisted of scones (one choco and one earl grey, still piping warm) accompanied with clotted cream and jam of what looked like a lingonberry variety.  It began with two "sandwiches", made of bagels with a diameter of 2 inches; one was salmon and radish, the other butter and jam.  Lastly, the desserts included a 1x1 inch chocolate cookie.Of course it tasted ridiculously good.Then we paid $47 for an afternoon snack for two people.There goes half my NY trip food budget.Oh and there was douchey-level annoying conversation next to us for us to mock (reference my Perilla review).
Justin B.}New York, NY}9}45}0}-1}4}3/29/2009}Cha-an is an authentic tea-room in a great neighborhood. It is a little bit tucked away up a flight of stairs, so you won't be finding tourists or annoying American kids in there (no offense, I am just trying to say that it is authentic).There is a diverse selection of teas, and you should be able to find something that suits your taste. Try one of the sets that includes cookies and pastries for a nice snack. It is a bit on the pricey side, but not unreasonable.I would suggest stopping for afternoon tea or for late night socializing.For a SECRET BONUS, check out the bathroom. They have one of those ultra-fancy Japanese toilets that has all all kinds of cleaning and drying functions. One of the only one of these toilets that I have found in NY. If you don't know what I mean, check it out and you will understand.
Norman S.}New York, NY}78}484}0}-1}3}3/26/2009}i heard a lot about the desserts here.  i think the only dessert worth coming for is the zenza which is the best aduki bean porridge dessert you can get anywhere - it is completely balanced.  everything else is just regular run of the mill dessert.  chikaliscious is way better and its just a block down the street.what should really bring you here is the beautiful interior and the tea ceremony room.  the teas are pretty decent.  silver needle white tea is decent but not brewed long enough.  the only white tea i really like is actually the bottled white tea from bombilla gourd company.
Mo Riza ..}New York, NY}139}206}1126}-1}4}3/21/2009}Quiet place to sip tea, but only if you get to sit in the special tatami room. Good teahouse with overwhelming selection of teas. Tasty but pricey appetizer. I come here often to set alone during the quiet hours of the early afternoon, during busy time I like to sit by the kitchen and see the very well coordinated dance of preparation by the staff.
Vivian L.}San Francisco, CA}142}312}22}18}4}3/19/2009}My first Yelp review ever! Came here last night for dinner with a friend. Really cute (but tiny) interior. Looks like a good place for an intimate dinner with a (small) group of friends or for a date. I didn't have to wait for a table luckily, but I could see how this place could get filled up really quickly, there was room for maybe 20 people in the whole place. Cash only, so come prepared! If you go for dinner there are pretty much only two options for food, Set A or Set B. Me and my friend got one of each, and neither of them were particularly memorable. Both sets come with dessert (Chef's Choice) and your choice of tea. I got the silver needle white tea, which was good but nothing amazing. There are unlimited refills on the tea. Portions look small but I was pretty full by the time we were done. Our desserts were a green tea pound cake with sake ice cream, and a red bean mochi with some sort of ground peanut powder sprinkled on top. Neither of them were too special. Unfortunately, you can't pick your own dessert instead of having Chef's Choice(we tried asking the waitress with no luck).From all the reviews I've read on Yelp about this place, I really wanted to try the Chocolate Mochi and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, so we ordered them on top of our dinner sets =). The chocholate mochi was super rich, and I definitely would not have been able to eat it all myself (it comes with 3 pieces). This dessert is not for the weak of heart and I would only recommend it for the true chocaholics out there. The Black Sesame Creme Brulee on the other hand was amazing! From the presentation, to the sesame ice cream served on top, it was flawless from beginning to end. I would go back for that dessert alone. I wouldn't suggest coming here for the food, the dessert is definitely the highlight here. If you go, eat some of that black sesame creme brulee for me =).
Erin L.}La Puente, CA}62}388}29}-1}5}3/18/2009}A-maaaaaaazing! Came her for dinner with a friend. This is a really small place so it wouldn't be good for a large group. The restaurant is really cute and the waitresses were nice. My friend got dinner set A and I got dinner set B. B is definitely better than A. A is more like a breakfast meal and the side dishes were okay. Both sets of dinner were okay...I'd give it maybe 3 stars for food. Each set comes with tea and a dessert picked by chef. Tonight the chef picked red bean mochi and green tea pound cake with sake ice cream on top. HOOOOOWEVEr....we ordered more desserts cuz we actually realllly wanted the chocolate mochi (3 of them - which the chocolate fudge/ganache on the inside was quite heavy....i didn't think it was super special) AND the black sesame creme brulee with a scoop of sesame ice cream on top. The creme brulee was HEAVENLY....ORGASMIC!!!!!! I'd go back there any day just to eat it!!!! This dessert was definitely asian fusion DONE RIGHT! I'm in love! ::sigh:: =)
Teddy P.}New Haven, CT}23}24}2}-1}4}3/17/2009}My friend and I had just eaten a rather filling dinner a few blocks north. He said he wanted tea. Since I'm no native New Yorker, I pulled out my iPhone and its Yelp application to find a nice place to get tea. Luckily, it was on the way to an ice cream parlor I wanted to try.And how glad I am that we tried it. I got very high-quality matcha tea; a nice portion of it. The price, though a bit steep, was definitely worth the experience. My friend got a black tea, complete with its associated tea ceremony. The hot water is poured into the very miniature teapot that contains the leaves; the water is left in for 15-20 seconds, then strained; this strained water is put into an aroma cup and then dumped immediately into the drinking cup. I think this is actually a Chinese tea ceremony (Wikipedia leads me to believe that it's Gongfu), but since I'm no expert, I make no strong claims.This whole ceremony-aspect made the experience a five-star one. The tea was delicious, as was my accompanying mochi. If you're looking for a high-quality tea-drinking experience, this is definitely the place in NYC. And I think it's worth every penny one might spend there.
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}5}3/17/2009}Help me, I've fallen.  Not since my time in Japan have I found a tea house so welling with charm.  A tiny little space with close seating and pleasant low firefly lighting, it scores high on intimacy, coziness, and magic.Once you get past the downright amazingness of the venue, past even the neat prettiness of the plates, you'll find that the food and the tea manage to match everything else.  Dinner combos (at least the bigger one) are plenty for a light meal.  A tofu quiche provides a few smooth custardy bites, and a tray of small dishes like squash curry, tomato miso, and tea-smoked salmon provide a tasty variety while still leaving room for dessert.  Combos come with one tea and one dessert (chef's choice) included.  I ordered the matcha ($3 extra), which I love and am hard-pressed to find stateside.  It was bright green and soothingly bitter, perfect for sipping with dessert.And oh, dessert.  I will not lie.  My friend and I polished off the strawberry mille-feuille and sake ice cream profiterole with azuki beans that came with our combos and proceeded to order the earl grey mochi truffles and black sesame creme brulee to round out our meals.  Two excellent decisions.I have to admit, the mille-feuille and sake ice cream were nice but rather forgettable.  I have issues with profiteroles thanks to the puff pastry's inability to stay soft in contact with ice cream, and Cha-An did not sufficiently address these issues.  The mochi truffles, though, were out of this world!  Each bite gave a wonderful sensation of soft mochi giving into a rich, dense, but yielding center, and the intense depth of chocolate flavor with just a subtle note of tea was sublime.  Nor was the black sesame creme brulee about to be outshone.  A salt-and-pepper marbled ball of sesame ice cream resting gorgeous under a sesame tuille and over a pot of sesame cream, all in a little quaint clay bowl, this was one of the handsomest desserts I have ever seen.  Incredibly, it tasted as good as it looked, with rich sesame flavors and a masterful mix of textures - cream on cream with crunchy moments in between.  I would've appreciated maybe a tiny tiny bit more of that caramelized layer, but I would rather have had around five more of what I already had.Service was nothing noteworthy, but waitresses were courteous and attentive.  My only complaint is that I was caught off guard with the no-credit-card policy and thought that prices were a little steep to demand cash only.  Nonetheless, I will return very soon.
Natalia K.}Oakland, CA}35}716}55}-1}5}3/16/2009}Definitely will be going back to Cha-An.I ordered the afternoon tea set and picked Darjeeling to accompany it. Friend picked Set B. Mine came with two mini sandwiches, scones, and cookies. Scrumptious is the word.Portions are small but we were full by the time we were done.Edit: I did go back two days later and fell in love with the earl grey chocolate mochi dessert.
Serena C.}New York, NY}37}160}13}-1}5}3/16/2009}I wasn't going to review this place because I didn't want anyone else to know about it, but it appears that hundreds of you all already knew...so what the hell. This place is a great place for a date. Or chatting with friends. They have savory food as well as desserts, and an extensive tea and drink menu (including alcoholic beverages).My companion and I split the dessert set ($17 for three desserts, plus tea), meaning I ate the three desserts and he had the tea. The waitress explained that the chef would choose three desserts that went together, and I observed that other tables that ordered this received similar but different menus.For me, the first dessert was an amazing caramel crunch ice cream--a sweet cream with crunchy toffee-nut bits. The second was a two-parter: the black sesame creme brulee and a fluffy raspberry mouse topped with fresh whipped cream. And the third was a green tea (matcha) macaroon with a chestnut (?) filling and a black sesame shortbread cookie. Everything was delicious, and the server did an amazing job of constantly refilling and pouring the tea for us (a full-bodied green tea). I was equally impressed that they didn't rush us out after we paid. I'll definitely be back. Tip: Octopus takoyaki from Otafuku next door plus the dessert set make for a great evening meal...
Nadia F.}New York, NY}35}84}0}-1}5}3/15/2009}Let's put it this way:  I am dying for an opportunity to go back.I love tea, and it was great to find this adorable tea house with charming decor and great matcha green tea!!  yum!  I didn't eat too much, but my friend did and he said it was good... and it looked like a tempting menu indeed.  Great place to hang with a friend
Ben C.}Brooklyn, NY}0}156}0}-1}4}3/6/2009}I almost walked right past this place since the doorway is small and unassuming but a female friend of mine kindly guided me through the door and up the stairs. the plae is small and intimate, something that a girl would like..I had no idea this was a tea room to be honest but it does have a tea room atmosphere now that i think about it. they dont have any "real" food but they do have small dishes that go well with tea. I think I had some octopus balls (I think they were octopus?) and they were pretty good, I would order a huge bowl of them if I could. Couldn't remember the names of the dishes we sampled but the dessert in unforgetable--their own vesion of walnut tiramisu--really really tasty and different from tiramisu..it was served in this glass container that resembled a tall fishbowl, with pieces of walnuts, pieces of angel food cake and topped with generous amounts of creamy tiramisu filling that had a similar consistancy as pudding (but more rich and smooth)
Chris C.}Wilmore, KY}29}96}0}-1}4}3/5/2009}Black sesame creme brulee is as good as it gets, and that's not hyperbole.  I admit that I'm biased because I'm partial to black sesame, but my first bite of the tasty confection counts as either my first or second most memorable taste of the past five years.  I shared a $17 dessert combination with my companion.  The tea was excellent.  First course was an exquisite bit of sake ice cream that was delightfully balanced.  Second course was the creme brulee and a green bean mochi that was very well done.  Third course consisted of a green tea macaroon (good, not great) and an exceptional shortbread that pairs well with bitter team.  I debated over that fifth star, but ultimately held back because only one dish (the sesame creme brulee) truly wowed me.  But that one dish... WOW.
Yeni H.}Orlando, FL}52}227}14}-1}4}2/14/2009}extensive menu of teas. so extensive they have more than 5 types of green teas. if i remembered correctly, they dont only sort their teas by country, but also by grade and obviously, fragrance/taste. they were out of several desserts when i went. what a waste. im not into green tea anything besides green tea drink(which was really fragrant) so that brings me to very little choices left. but anyway, the place was serene, although it could use more natural sunlight(the window's tiny). i'll be back primarily for their good selection tea. desserts wasn't fantastic.
Ash H.}Brooklyn, NY}1}51}6}-1}4}2/14/2009}So I, and a friend I haven't seen in a bit went here Wednesday night. We walked in, up a narrow, short flight of stairs and through a curtain into a small Japanese oasis. At first I was worried the setting was too quiet for us to have a a lively dinner conversation, but those fears were quickly allayed because as serene as the setting is it allows for you to "carry on" as normal without worry. The space is small (approx. 6-8 tables and 6-7 seats at the bar) with dimmer than usual lighting, all creating the aura of oasis. Our waitress was deferential (that's the best way I can describe it ), made timely appearances, and nodded after any interaction with us. But let's not kid ourselves it's the food that matters! The menu is set up so that you have a choice of one of two "Sets" (A or B). I ordered Set B which includes a  quiche starter (it had mushrooms-which I typically hate but didn't even notice in this delightful and delicate dish!), about 5 seemingly small but perfectly portioned bowls: a kale?/seaweed? soup, fresh salmon w/ radish (?) slaw and a cream sauce, rice (nutty undertones-mmm), a pallid fish dish with a root vegetable that was water based as it was starchy, fried balls of goodness resting on a bed of kale?/spinach?-I definitely got my fill of iron that night). To be honest, I didn't know what to expect in my Set because the menu description was nonexistent. I'm guessing what I ate that night (as all the ?s in my description of the bowls lets on) qualifies as Japanese fare but I have no clue as my standard Japanese fare usually consists of sushi/katsu. Whatever it was, it was good! I mixed and matched and the flavors complemented each other very well: extremely subtle yet seasoned. Above all, at the end of our meal, I was at capacity and could barely finish (considering I usually have a healthy appetite and ate next to nothing all day before coming here). The tea: I should have taken more care and perused the extensive and carefully constructed tea menu instead of going for the Ceylon (Sri Lankan tea) that I love so much. You are given your own teapot, which was more than sufficient because, as an ardent tea lover, I had half a teapot left! The meal ended with Chef's choice desserts. We ended up with a cheesecake (so good!) with a drizzle of some kind of fruit compote ( not overwhelming at all) and a creamfilled, bready dessert (not bad). My only complaint the desserts were too similar and as great as the cheesecake was I hoped for something more "Japanese" inspired ( whatever that means). All in all a great/filling night in a space that lends itself to lingering. I want to return to sample some more of their teas and desserts.P.S.-If you are into bidets, the toilet in the women's bathroom is awesome!
E-Kan S.}Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA}114}30}3}-1}4}2/10/2009}Cha-An is like a quaint, mellow little cove, perfect for hiding from the cold. Great for small groups.  They take their desserts and teas very seriously. They have a platter combination fo three desserts for 17 bucks, which might sound expensive, but is totally worth it.  And you can ask for chef's choice (don't remember the japanese term for it) where he'll whip a little combo together with pieces that'll complement each other.  You can even give them an idea of something you like, or flavors you prefer, or just leave it up to them. Either way you're in good hands. All flavors are subtle and tasteful, the way it should be. The matcha tea is  a popular one, but I actually prefer the chai latte. And to boot there's a bidet. Not sure if you all are aware of them, but they're in quite a few more of the authentic Japanese restaurants here in the city.  And by the way, what's the deal with only the women's bathroom having one?? I'm sure there's some Japanese custom I am not aware of, but still, us men like to have a fresh tush too! Just a thought.  Anyway, come check out the place.
Chester R.}New York, NY}5}8}0}-1}5}2/3/2009}two things first: 1) do not come ... please. you are ruining my zen. 2) do not come here just to use the fancy toilet (ahem women) - you make me quite sad. You are sooo missing the point of this little gem. Easily the best tea house in the city within an affordable price range. The food is very well prepared - always subtle, never overpowering. The tea is of good quality.* The mixed drinks are also superb and made with good sake. my favorites: Set B, Afternoon Tea Set (gotta love that raspberry butter and green tea macaroon), and I am very partial to the Honey Phoenix Oolong. do not: order genmaicha or earl grey if you have a choice. Its like going to House of Brews and ordering a Miller Lite. *the way they serve their black tea really, really, really irks me. There is no way for me to control the brew. The Keemun can handle it (and the Assam if you are adding milk) but it does a real disservice to the Darjeeling and the Ceylon.
Joan D.}Maspeth, NY}243}58}4}-1}5}1/31/2009}Cha-An is a beautiful treasure. It is a quiet and peaceful place to spend an afternoon with friends.  The food was delicious.  I had the "Set B" with the quiche, soup, salmon, veggie and a delightful cake with sorbet.  All the food was well prepared and tasty. They had a large selection of teas (with descriptions) and I look forward to going back and trying another one.
Amy L.}New York, NY}409}136}15}-1}4}1/29/2009}The cutest little Japanese tea place. Seems like the kind of place (female) New Yorkers eat up - surprised it wasn't packed when we came in on a Saturday afternoon, but we got a table for 6 without much fuss. Serious attention to detail in both place setting, food, and tea service. Chopsticks (while disposable) came tied up with a tiny little twine bow. My tea was lovely and served with care. Unique prix fixe tea menus, both sweet and savory, all with a Japanese flair. I had just come from brunch so was too full to eat, but I wish I hadn't been!
Miranda S.}Brooklyn, NY}39}134}0}-1}5}1/26/2009}Located in the East Village, not far from St. Marks Place, Cha An feels like a secret, special discovery. Up the narrow staircase from the street you'll find a tiny vestibule sheltering a small bench enclosed by bamboo. If you've had the bad fortune to arrive once the place is full (easy to accomplish since Cha An is tinsy-weensy), you will develop a close and special relationship with this bench during your long wait (Cha An's atmosphere invites lingering and patrons are in no hurry to vacate the precious tables).Once seated you are in for a treat. Cha An has a lovely menu that centers around - as you might surmise - teas. Each is described in detail (there is even a map showing where different teas come from and so on and so forth) and all are equally hard to chose from. There are tons of selections, including herbal, black, green, and white teas. All are prepared and served differently and in the manner most suited to the particular tea you have selected. They are NOT messing around here.There is also a small menu of savory and sweet delights. I should disclose at this juncture that I am wildly, uncontrollably addicted to mochi. Cha An offers a mochi treat so ridiculously, fantabulously good that I am shuddering ever-so-slightly in delight just thinking about it. Appealing to the chocolate-lover in me, this mochi dessert is filled with tea-infused dark chocolate truffle. I deem it Absurdly Good.As the winter draws in tigher and more cruelly around us, I find myself thinking about Cha An all the time....and wishing that it was located around the corner from my apartment!
Emily K.}New York, NY}14}234}0}-1}4}1/17/2009}I hate using the word "zen" to describe anything, but it fits this place perfectly.  Tranquil and cozy, it's a nice break from the hectic bustle of the East Village.The teas are all fine and dandy, but the thing to get here during the colder season is hands down their zenzai, a sweet dessert soup/puree of azuki (red) beans, which comes with toasted mochi and chestnuts.  Portion seems small, but always remember your eyes are bigger than your stomach.  Comes piping hot and sits heavy and sweet in your belly to warm you up before you trek outside again.
Fiona L.}Brooklyn, NY}189}82}4}-1}5}1/12/2009Updatedreview}Ah yes, within a weeks, I've went there again. Maybe it's the atmosphere that catches my attention or just the unique adorable desserts...My friend is leaving to India to study abroad soon, and he always wanted to try this tea place, so we went, before he leaves us. I had dinner here, and at night it was either meal A or meal B, and I picked meal B but they gave me A, where it came with appetizers, congee rice, and tea smoked salmon. Very delicious, and of course I had to have desserts, so I tried green tea truffles and Cha An's sweets. The tea I tried today, was White Peony and Green Tea GenimachaI wish they got our orders right though, because meal B would've been worth eating than meal A, but that's fine. Also their workers needs to be a tad louder, because it's hard to hear them. I'll come back in a year, when I can spend 140 on food again (for a table of 5 people)
Sonia C.}Seattle, WA}408}864}61}-1}4}1/11/2009}Soothing place to rest and chat on a cold winter afternoon.  We all ordered various teas from their decently-sized tea menu (teas range from $5-$12 per pot, average $7).  I had their auspicious New Year's green tea for good luck.  Each Japanese tea came in its own little teapot, each one filled with just enough hot water for one cup (unlimited refills though).  Some of the teas are served in a large round glass so you can watch the tea unfurl in the hot water (the flower tea is really pretty).Two of my friends split the tea set which was exquisitely presented - the main dish of 15 grain rice porridge were accompanied with 6 different small dishes.  Seemed pretty good, but quite expensive at $18.Overall, good place if a tiny bit pricey.  Service is good, though a little absentminded sometimes.  Cash only.
tc h.}San Francisco, CA}10}90}0}-1}4}1/11/2009}my sis showed me this place when we were looking around for dinner.  i ended up coming back with jon instead.  we ordered the 2 different set meals with chef's choice for dessert, and 2 teas.the atmosphere was great, very cute, very japanese.  very quiet.  i liked the service, it was respectful and fairly prompt.  i liked the set meals, they were very subtle tastes but very different (they were more on the bland side but i like it that way sometimes).  the tea was very good.  the dessert was unusual (chestnut swiss roll and strawberry with butter cookie) but quite passable.  this place is fairly expensive for the amount of food you get and what they charge but i'd go back because i like varied and bland food sometimes.
Lei L.}New York, NY}86}56}0}-1}4}1/10/2009}hands down a wonderful place to relax! very beautiful, cosy interior, with a small tea room inside to kneel and practice making japanese tea. they have a great cha-an set menu with cute tiny dishes. everything is tastefully done, and a lot of attention to detail. some of the waitresses have clearly been trained in art of tea service, every movement is done with precision and perfection. notice the small bouquet of japanese flowers at your table. just a relaxing place to whittle way the afternoon hours after a cold day in nyc. bathrooms are automatic and seats are warm. a major plus. beware of the toilet seat that opens automatically.
Pan R.}Manhattan, NY}0}199}8}-1}4}1/8/2009}The place is very small (probably seating 20), but cozy. Upon leaving, we saw this section where people would climb in and kneel to eat, but I do not know if customers can actually go there...It was somewhat empty when we were there, so despite the tight space, no conversations other than our own was heard.The decor is pretty cute, the light somewhat dim.The hostess was friendly, but her accent made it hard to hear some words.The tea tasted great! For abut $5-$8 you get a cup of tea with unlimited refills once the waitress/hostess comes around.Since I only tried the desserts, I have to say they were only okay-tasting. Sesame was in almost everything. The green tea cake, green tea scones, biscuit (?), and etc were rather dry. The dainty ice cream was sweet and delicious. However, the price for such is a bit too much and not worth it.The toilet was pretty cool. I thought water was supposed to spray up, but it didn't... If the toilet was automatic, I do not see why the faucet was not... Overall, it's a good place, but not somewhere I would go again due to my budget... unless I'm going just to drink tea (:
Margs K.}Los Angeles, CA}325}639}47}18}4}1/4/2009}I love this place - very authentic atmosphere, the tea selection is wonderful, and the hostesses couldn't be nicer. However, I wish it was just a tad bigger. Other reviews have described Cha-An as being "cute" and "intimate," but they must work in real estate because the place is straight up small. Most of the tables are within inches of each other, so you're either subjected to your neighbor's conversation or vice versa. But, despite that, I still rate it four-stars. (The bathroom itself merits a star on its own.)
Christina Z.}New York, NY}2}10}8}-1}5}12/28/2008}i LOVE this place!great service, great food, great atmosphere - very intimate and perfect for dates or eating with a friend.I  shared the Cha-An set B and the Chef's Dessert Assortment with a friend.  Both comprised of multiple dishes or desserts, but the portions were very small.  We became full mainly from the tea and the bread basket (best bread i've ever had in my life) we ordered.  Although the food was little, it was amazing!  Probably some of the best dishes I have ever tried.So, Cha-An is not a great place to go to if you're starving.  You should only eat here if you want to impress a certain someone, you're in the mood to eat and if you can eat slowly to savor the taste.Overall, it was a great experience.  =)  Unlike most places I've eaten at, these people were nice enough to not shove the check in my face while in mid-bite.  They waited very patiently until i asked them for the check.There aren't many Japanese tea rooms around! this is definately a place to check out.
Han B.}New York, NY}18}31}0}-1}5}12/27/2008}upon my first visit, I was a bit confused as to whether or not it was a imitation of a Japanese tea house or the real thing...It is the real thing and regardless, it delivers. A large selection of quality teas. the menu of the teas is a bit over done (going into great detail how tea is made etc) for my taste, but that's just personal I guess. The food and desserts are great. The service is always perfect. The interior is well done and the bathrooms are really cute too. They have a private tatami room (that's a bit pricey...? perhaps? but its there for that special occasion... ) which I really like. It's a bit pricey but worth it... when I go w a friend getting tea w snack its about $20- 25 (including tip) I think.Its hard to find a good place for tea and snacks... for the east village this would be it.
Jean H.}New York, NY}40}466}13}-1}4}12/18/2008}to be honest, ive only been here for dessert and tea. they have an EXCELLENT tea selection. the white tea is SO DELICIOUS!!!!&lt;3!!ive traveled through china and had some very delicious, rare and very good teas. this white tea really brings me back to southern china! oh! the memories!sometimes the wait for a table is long, so going in smaller groups is betterthe desserts are quite nice! go! its really yummy and a cute/nice date place too! the servings are small though- so i guess its kinda expensive if you look at it as a go!
Hana Y.}Long Island City, NY}90}79}0}-1}5}12/17/2008}I LOOOOVE this place.  All the food is so subtle and delicate in flavor.  It is the Japanese version of fine-dining, and it's my favorite type of food!  Seasonal vegetables express their natural flavors.  Cute little presentations, nice service, and quiet, peaceful setting.  I need to go back soon to refresh my memory!Although I grew up drinking green tea, I'm not exactly a connoisseur.  But I can definitely say that their tea selection is absolutely huge, and I'm sure their brewing is done just right too.The desserts are great too.  Not exactly cheap, but not over-priced in anyway.
Doris K.}San Diego, CA}244}455}134}-1}5}12/2/2008}Phenomenal! Dim lighting, serene feeling, tasty desserts. We came here after having a huge amount of yakitori but I was determined to try the desserts from all of the reviews that I have read. Instead of having tea, we opted for the lychee martini (made with saki) and a bottle of their extra dry sake (can't remember the name but it was only $15). Both were a great start to our romantic night out. We then proceeded with the earl tea chocolate mochi and the apple sweet potato tart. Both were gone as soon as they hit the table. They were just THAT GOOD. The utensils came in a very cute mini wicker basket as did the bill. The best part of all was the bathroom! The toilet was electronic, had a seat warmer, a front cleaner, a middle cleaner, a back cleaner, and many more options. Haven't taken a shower in a while? Don't worry because Cha An's bathroom will take care of that! The next time I come here I plan on having more than just two desserts.
infusia i.}New York, NY}8}16}0}-1}5}11/26/2008}oh cha-an, i adore you. with 1763259725 types of tea to choose from, i am truly spoilt. i felt i had been teleported into a teahouse in japan through the tiny door at 230 East 9th Street. do not expect  the same wide array to the food or dessert here, but you can certainly indulge in the idiosyncrascies of how tea being prepared and served.  the teacups were warmed with hot water before they poured the tea in for serving. each teapot seemed to magically only contained the exact volume of each teacup. don't ask me what's the whole point with the teapot thingie but they have earned the 5 stars for service, ambience, the wide selection of teas and the limited selection yet eat your heart out desserts. i could not resist zenzai dessert every single time i stepped into Cha An and it has never disappointed me so far. the chef has been creative to switch from green tea ice cream, served with a dollop of sweet red bean paste and utterly chewy and melt in your mouth mochi to black sesame paste with mochi. oh wait, i forgot to mention the thin sesame biscuit which taste all so exquisite. i had the Cha An dinner set, which was pretty good except the servings were so tiny. thankfully the dessert made up for it.
Jeff C.}New York, NY}1142}1258}14}-1}4}11/24/2008Updatedreview}After you burn that 1 calorie ascending the stairs to the 2FL, tell yourself that all your sinful pleasures here are justified. Never knew how many different lunch/dinner/tea sets they offered here, all at reasonable prices. For the dessert tasting menu, you might as well get it if you have a sweet tooth, as each dish is at least $7 by itself anyway. We shared the dessert tasting menu and it was ample to cap off a Sunday Night. I was shocked that the place was still at least half full @ 10pm. I'll be back to try the cooked foods next time, maybe even a Japanese-infused drink or two! Came here for dessert after Kyo Ya. 3 COURSE DESSERT TASTING MENU ($17, choice of tea)-Green Tea Latte w/ red beans - served in a bowl, thick and creamy, just the way I like it (that's what she said)-Mixed Berry Ice Cream - with sesame cracker, saw the vanilla bean specks in this, taste was nothing special though-Strawberry Mille-feille, Goma Creme Brulee - they called it a mille-feille so I expected layers of puff pastry a la Napoleon, but it was really a puffy pastry sandwiched between layers of strawberry cream w/ strawberries on the base, very good, goma creme brulee was good too, but it takes a back seat to Sakagura's -Goma Cookie, Green Tea Macaroon - goma cookie was extremely buttery and crumbly, just OK, green tea macaroon was good but I would have preferred green tea filling instead of a vanilla based cream.They also offer:-Afternoon Tea Set for ($18) [2 sammiches/scones/sweets/choice of tea]-Daily Lunch Special ($10) [meat of the day w/ appetizer & genmaicha]-Cha-An Dinner Set ($16) [15 grain porridge - 6 mini appetizers/dessert/choice of tea]-Cha-An Dinner Set ($19) [Today's soup & Veg - soy milk quiche w/ mushrooms & scallions/tea smoked salmon/15 grain rice/dessert/choice of tea]-Lychee Martini/Matcha Comfort/Sake Mojito ($7/ea)Total came out to $10.50/pp after everythingPics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…
Loretta H.}San Francisco, CA}10}95}22}-1}4}11/15/2008}It's so hard to determine a rating for this place.  I absolutely loved it when it first opened but had lost interest after a while.  The place is perfect for just getting together with friends for chit-chat.  The twelve-leaf oolong tea is good.  It comes with the complete tea set.  Would not recommend eating dinner or desserts here.  I am surprise they still aren't good with desserts.Love their bathroom.  I always enjoy clean and greatly designed bathrooms at restaurant.  Who wants to go to a disgusting bathroom after eating?
Renee M.}New York, NY}126}340}18}-1}4}11/14/2008}This place is amazing!!! Absoblutely Amazing....as soon s you walk in your get this feeling of serenity and traditional tea house feeling...the decor is beautiful..a Friend and I went here for a early evening tea and it was fabulous! The tea came in cute lil tea pots....the lil appetizers they served was delish esp the earl grey choco mochi...they had the most unique tasting mochi's tehre....green tea of course, but blk sesame creme brulee was light and had jsut the right hint of blk sesame....
Drew C.}Altadena, CA}9}58}6}-1}4}11/3/2008}Great place to bring a date.  Very intimate for a small party but not really great if party is bigger than 15 people.  Hard to maneuver.  Food is great.  Was expecting something spectacular.  The Green Tea Matcha Sake is awesome takes great.  Not too shabby to end the evening.
Lin H.}New York, NY}75}255}2}-1}4}10/12/2008}I think I have to start frequenting more traditional Japanese restaurants. The impeccably polite service is such a nice change from the usual treatment we get in NYC. sigh! Earl Grey chocolate mochi - I really liked the tea flavor in the chocolate, but the chocolate itself was so dense and rich I couldn't eat it all. Probably good news for a real chocolate lover. ;)Black sesame creme brulee - mmmmm. Not eggy at all. Nice subtle flavor. I was surprised it came out in a little bowl, not a shallow dish. Big scoop of sesame ice cream on top. Does it get any better?
Karen C.}Torrance, CA}7}15}5}-1}5}10/10/2008}LOVE this place.  I discovered it by accident on my trip to NY one year.  Ever since then, I'll go back any time I'm in NY.  The dinner set comes with your choice of tea, brown rice bowl, condiments, and a set of dessert.  I wouldn't say it's enough food for a guy but the dessert makes up for it.  Their green tea flan is superb and I haven't been able to find another place that can compare.  Great place to have quiet talk with friends or for a date.  Best thing is they have a semi-open kitchen so you can see them preparing for your tea and dessert.
Masumi T.}New York, NY}94}388}110}18}3}10/4/2008}Before I start, I think I need to put in a disclaimer that I'm not a big dessert person.  I came here after dinner for a little something sweet and I certainly got it.  It was a big night and they had run out of most things.  They had what we were originally going to order which were the Earl Grey Chocolate Mochi and Green Tea Truffles.  The mochi did have a nice hint of earl grey essence.  The chocolate inside was EXTREMELY rich.  It was too much for me.  I had one and it was enough for me.  The truffle had a pretty strong green tea essence and it also was very rich.  I didn't like this dessert because it was coated in green color white chocolate and I don't like white chocolate.However, the selection of teas was excellent.  They have teas from Japan and China as well.  I had a delicious Sencha which went well with my chocolate dessert.  It was dark and slightly bitter and delicious.  For our second tea we tried Dragon Well which was pretty much hot water.  I don't recommend it.The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice.  The lighting is soft and dim with a dark wood counter.  The staff was quick and attentive.  Typical of a Japanese establishment... in my opinion.
Miss H.}San Francisco, CA}42}215}31}-1}4}9/27/2008}Imagine this, you're a lightweight or maybe even allergic to alcohol, so what is one to do when it's raining and has just had a big dinner and dessert tasting at Chikalicious?  Go to Cha-An for some tea and small sweets.  I love the ambiance and decor of this place.  The staff is also very friendly and never pushed us to go.  We spent a good 2-3 hours here, just chatting and resting our feet.  We happily drank our tea and ate the small little treats, much like an English afternoon tea with a Japanese twist.  We never felt pressured to leave and we never felt we were overstaying our welcome b/c there was never a wait for our table.I didn't get a chance to try anything savoury, but looked around at the food that was being served and it definitely peaked my curiosity.  I will be back again.
Princess M.}New York, NY}34}337}591}-1}4}9/25/2008}Great desserts.My favorite dessert here is the chocolate mochi.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM.The various teas and milk teas are good too although sometimes I feel the menu looks confusing.Definitely a nice place to grab a cuppa and some dessert with friends.
Wendy C.}New York, NY}0}303}23}-1}4}9/22/2008}I had lunch here the first time almost 2 months ago. I was so intrigued by the dessert menu, I decided to come back for desserts only. This obscure 2nd floor establishment does not resemble any of the Japanese food joints that line up line up along St. Marks Place. It's the kitschy Zen decor which separate it from that prototype. The serenity of the atmosphere can make you fall asleep. I was tempted to do yoga on the spot, but I didn't want to offend my lunch buddy.I had the Cha-An set A with ice mint tea, my lunch partner had the set B. I was intrigued by the soy milk quiche with mushrooms & scallions that came with the B. It wasn't tasty, but it was pretty interesting to look at. The dessert portion was small, but it was big on taste. The black sesame creame brulee is the only thing on the menu worth raving about. I liked it so much that I came back  & only ordered that. In lieu of the full tea selection, I treated myself to a lychee martini. This is definitely a place for those who like dining alone.
Liz E.}Flushing, NY}39}416}228}-1}4}9/5/2008}I love the serenity and dim lighting of this zen-like restaurant, and was amused to find not a single male in the entire joint when I arrived. I was greeted kindly and sat at the counter to enjoy a bowl of traditional, Japanese zenzai ($8). A red bean soup, it's barely sweet at all, filled with globular, chewy mochi and chestnut. I especially loved the buttery, sweet black sesame tuile adorning the side of the stone bowl.I must caution those with small pockets against the rather large prices, but for something so tasty, I think it's worth it once in a while.
Candice A.}Brooklyn, NY}83}250}15}-1}4}9/2/2008}One point for the pretty place. Its so cute and cozy and I love japanese bathrooms.Another point for the good and reasonably price food. I had the special of the day, which was the unagi. Super good and their potato salad was also delicious (it came with it). The black sesame creme brulee was SOOO GOOD! The only thing I didnt like was that it's a bit off my budget. (I'm a stingy student) 7 bucks for the creme brulee. and 12 for the matcha tea. Apparently, if you add $3 more, you might as well do the tea ceremony which is scheduled (so its $15 total). The people next to us had the three course dessert. I want to try that next time. Sure it just said, cookies and cake, but there are around 4 or 5 kinds of those to choose from for $16. its a good deal =9
Lisa M.}Alexandria, VA}59}67}7}-1}4}9/1/2008}Sweet little tea house that exudes serenity. Cha-An is a great place to try some desserts (you can get three of them with one order) and a variety of teas. I personally prefer the crispness of the white tea. We were there close to closing time and never felt rushed. A little rushing brook makes me wish I could take a nap and/or meditate for a few hours. Either way, after spending an easy hour (or was it two?) inside, I emerge as relaxed as if I'd had a full night's sleep. Definitely worth a spot on the rotation.
Ingrid C.}San Francisco, CA}366}585}207}-1}5}8/25/2008}Cha-An is simply superb. The space is simple and elegant. I can sit comfortably with friends for hours. The menu is well laid-out; my boyfriend especially likes the map showing where all the teas come from. When my best friend comes into town, we usually spend some time having tea here; we usually split two different afternoon tea set menus, always featuring yummy pastries and other delectables. My last recent visit consisted of one of their delicious white teas (the $7 one - I'm blanking on the name for a moment). What drew me was the description of butter and almonds. Indeed, it did have butter and almonds on the nose, and the tea felt weighted with butter in my mouth. Delicious. My friend got these amazing earl grey tea chocolate mochis. $8 for three, but like scrumptiously smooth and rich chocolate tea truffles wrapped in soft, chewy mochi. Mmm. Another reason to love New York.
Nami C.}Rockville, MD}1}43}44}-1}5}8/19/2008}Another reason for us to move to New York.....Very pretty little, cute, detail, neat tea house (but they also serve food.)  Once I step in, it was like I were in Japan and may be even better.  The place may be small but the attitude towards food, health and environment are definitely huge.  It is not hard to notice every little details the owner puts in.  With all these high quality everything and they still maintain very reasonable pricing, the lunch special set is only $10 including tea with only $3 more you get to try chef dessert special. On our way out, we saw a take out notes...OMG, they even have class to teach people make all these delicious cookies etc. for only $50 a class including lunch and bring back your own master piece....I am so wanting to live in NY.CASH ONLY place
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}8/16/2008}Excellent, authentic little Japanese teahouse nestled on the 2F. The space is simply decorated, intimate, and has limited seating. Perfect for any intimate gathering/date. A good selection of Asian teas and some sake/wine. They have hot food and tons of dessert items. The portion size is quaint and small, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you were famished since the prices ain't cheap. You're paying for the atmosphere. Everything I've had here is excellent. The Afternoon Tea Set ($18) could feed two. The macaron filled with azuki beans was disappointing (I love a good macaron) but the scones, shortbread cookies, pound cake are all excellent.
Mike B.}Brooklyn, NY}1}1}0}-1}5}8/1/2008}Great place! was my first time, but certainly not the last!8 things to remember:1. bring cash only 2. bring a date(or a friend of the opposite sex)3. try the jasmine peals green tea4. try the matcha latte(even the ice is tasty?)5. try the choclate mochi6. try the Black Sesame creme brulee7. check out the bathroom(super nice, super clean)8. check out the scenery
mary k.}New York, NY}2}22}0}-1}5}7/31/2008}"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" is indeed!I love drinking tea =P  PRO:- nice setting- great selections to choose from- awesome Japanese toilet ... it reminds me of home *sob*went here on a date, ROMANTIC it is!
Lauren L.}New York, NY}28}103}17}-1}5}7/28/2008}I've never given five stars to places where I've only eaten one dish, but Cha-An is IT. Their adzuki bean toast was seriously the bomb diggity dig and truckloads more. I adore the adzuki bean toast. If I had nothing to eat for the rest of my life but this toast, I would be happy. I'm not one of those reviewers that speaks lightly of such things, but this toast blew my mind like no other toast before it, and likely no toast to follow. It consisted of a super thick slice of toast (around 3 inches thick) that had a small hollow filled with sweet stewed adzuki beans topped with freshly whipped cream (with a mild, mild hint of lemon) and maybe a little vanilla syrup. The toast was buttery toasted perfection, tender on the inside, a beautiful light tan color (no charredness here) and crisp, flaky deliciousness all around. I'm normally also not a fan of whipped cream, but their freshly whipped version was both light and delectable. There are no other words for it, I love this toast. This is possibly the best thing I have tasted all summer. This toast makes me swoon, makes me close my eyes and want to eat it forever.I sound like a crazy person, raving about a baked good, but trust me, it is that good. It's not too horrendously priced at $7, and you may think that it's just a sweet snack, but it holds up pretty well as a meal on its own. The interior is very cute (with a small tatami room for tea ceremonies), but it's pretty small and they don't take reservations so get there early or at a non-peak time. They are also cash only, so bring cash or else you'll miss out on the toast of a lifetime!
Carl C.}Brooklyn, NY}25}153}3}-1}4}7/10/2008}Teas! Desserts! Charming cozy friendly japanesey setting!  Really cool place to bring a date, have some tea and dessert and have, I dunno, a conversation? Maybe? You like talking right?
Rich S.}Los Angeles, CA}199}68}11}-1}5}7/5/2008}The first japanese tea room I tried in NY and was pretty pleased. The tea selection is vast with traditional leaf teas and also a nice selection of herbal teas.The highlight of this tea house however is the exquisite desserts they prepare to compliment your teas. We had the black sesame creme brulee and an unforgettable toast dish with whip cream and ice cream over it (with hints of sake and a citrus flavor added to the mix). Both were excellent and light.
Audrey J.}Los Angeles, CA}606}617}78}-1}4}7/1/2008}Count me in the (seemingly very very small) minority that considers public bidets (and lord only knows what other feats that commode is capable of) kind of....gross.You heard me.Sorry, ladies (you know who you are, and you know I LUVVVVS YOU), but it kind of grosses me out, no ways around it.Aside from that, let me get back to reviewing the place itself. The desserts are innovative and pack a potent -- yet complexly delicate -- impact. The azuki toast with JASMINE ICE CREAM (take note!) is ESPECIALLY heart stopping. And, yes, heart stopping in more ways than one. Never mind the fact that you're consuming enough butter to grease a turkey roasting pan -- the taste sensations that your tongue will be privileged to behold will have your heart pitter-pattering with glutton-ecstasy.The place itself is rather tiny, and you'll likely have a bit of a wait to get a seat. Once you do get a seat, you are in for one amazing experience that will have you thinking "only in New York."  Be prepared to bust out the dollah dollah bills, however, because this place doesn't take credit cards. (Minus points right there!)I like this place, and their desserts, for the most part, are delicious. Their service, while not perfect (they once forgot to put in our order and we sat for upwards of 20 minutes with no sign of life), is nevertheless friendly and respectful.  They gave us green tea cookies as a sort of penance for forgetting our order. The green tea cookies were unfortunately NOT amazing, but really...nobody's perfect, right?Overall, recommended.P.S.: That being said, I'm still not sure how I feel about a toilet seat that's smart enough to lift its lid in welcome upon my approach.
Brett M.}San Francisco, CA}7}35}0}-1}4}6/19/2008}We went for the Japanese Tea Ceremony, which is quite a bit different than most of the other reviews.  That said, it was really, really fun to sit in the little teahouse and have the tea ceremony performed for us.I do love me some matcha, and our hostess was so gracious at explaining the significance of the tea house and the tea and every part of the ceremony.I have to say though, that kneeling for almost 45 minutes really made my legs hurt, and it made me sweat so profusely and in a way that I'm sure would be considered completely disgusting in Japan.  Oh, and also, my companion had a bit of a wardrobe malfunction when standing up...so just be forewarned: *there will be much kneeling.*  Kneeling and all notwithstanding, we're definitely coming back.
Steve K.}Chicago, IL}16}36}0}-1}4}6/12/2008}I came here for lunch. There was a long wait to be seated. The dining space is small and calm; it's good for subdued conversation with a date. The furnishings and decorations are tidy and cute, and the food is presented beautifully. The service is rather cold and distant, in a painfully chic sort of way. The desserts and teas are excellent! The other menu offerings are passable - not exceptionally tasty, nor filling. There are no vegan options.I would like to come here again for dessert and tea. Everything is expensive, but you get what you pay for.
Moon B.}Elmhurst, NY}95}97}151}-1}3}6/11/2008}..... i had high expectations of this place after reading everyone's reviews, but i'm sorry to say, it fell short.i tried the following:- black sesame creme brulee- sakura flan- earl gray chocolate mochi- cold (something, i forgot the japanese word).... it's ricecakes w/ redbean paste- lavender mint tea- white peony tea- lemon verbena tea"the you-know-what over at you-know-where is better," i whispered furtively to my friends who were with me. i had to keep my voice low because we were sitting at the bar right in front of three waitresses who were diligently wiping teapots and teacups, casting long empty stares over our heads. the 'you-know-what' i was talking about referred to the black sesame crisp that came with the creme brulee, and 'you-know-where' was kyotofu. i found the black sesame crisp at cha-an too thick, chewy and slightly stale. i like my black sesame crisp to be lace-thin and crunchy. yah, just like at 'you-know-where'.i can comment on each individual item i tried, but i shan't. i will, however, say that the prices here are a bargain (relative to the proportions). maybe i'm getting what i pay for, because i think that none of the desserts really stood out. they tasted too similar and the flavours simply fused with and disappeared into one another. after a while, you don't even care anymore if you'd just scooped into the black sesame creme brulee or the redbean paste or the greenbean-based sakura flan, because they all tasted the same. it was around this time when my tastebuds were screaming "boring!!! boring!!! boring!!!". :(as for the teas, i like the vast selection offered here. the lavender verbena was delicious, with matching fragrance to boot. the white peony, so so.... tasted way too mild to earn a proper description. the lavender mint, sadly, tasted more like regular peppermint tea with undetectable lavender flavour nor smell. i gotta mention that they brew most of the tea for you here, so expect to get a pot of tea water sans leaves. hence, perhaps the white peony and lavender mint teas were underbrewed? who knows.in conclusion, this place isn't so bad that i'd give it less than 3 stars. in fact, i'm willing to return here again to try the cooked food, but i'm more than okay with skipping dessert. (IMO, fans of black sesame should head over to 'you-know-where' and order the black sesame sweet tofu; it is far more superior there.)note: toilet bowl is installed with lots of buttons, including bidet functions. fancy schmancy.
Maria C.}New York, NY}19}146}1}-1}5}6/4/2008}Cha-An is everything I ever wanted and more.  Came here about a half hour before closing on a Sat. night.  No wait.  I had some dessert wine (cannot remember the name) and they served it with a few sweet crunchy walnuts.  A perfect accompaniment!!!  Loved it.  Fiancee had the sake mojito which was just ok.  We shared the azuki toast, and black sesame creme brulee.  I don't have much to add to the reviews on these two amazing menu items.  I'll just say that the black sesame creme brulee was exceptionally good.  It was just so... sesame!!!  Everything down to the black sesame crisp.  Its not your traditional creme brulee at all, so if that is what you are expecting it tastes nothing like it.  Some flavored creme brulees are still reminiscent of creme brulee but this one, not really.  All the menu items seem to have a japanese twist.  As for the bathrooms, the squirting toilet creeped me out a little bit.  Is that sanitary?  It must be, but I think from now on I will stick to the good old fashioned toilet paper.  I'm old school like that.
Nicholas S.}Cambridge, MA}4}213}0}-1}5}5/30/2008}What a great place. It's tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript building, so you might not even notice it as you pass by. Cha-an serves a nice variety of teas and japanese desserts, as well as western ones like macarons and mille-feuille. The prices are very reasonable, and the food and tea are great, so this is a great place to linger with a friend over tea and sweets.
Katee L.}Los Angeles, CA}121}263}23}-1}5}5/20/2008}I only came here for dessert and tea, but both were VERY good. The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce was pretty awesome.I think I came on a Friday night and there was a little bit of a wait. The place is pretty small. I want to come back and try the real food. It looked pretty good.
Daphne H.}San Francisco, CA}78}444}18}-1}4}5/15/2008}YUMMY!!!Cha-An Adzuki Toast and Black Sesame Creme Brulee and Sake Mojito! Excellent for dessert - went on a Thursday night and we didn't have to wait. The Cha-An Adzuki Toast served with Jasmine Ice Cream alone is worth going to check this place out. I practically devoured half of it before my dessert partner could tuck in... :PThey look like they have a great tea-time menu too - I'll be back to try 'em! Oh and I forgot to check out their toilet - so that'll be on the to-do list for next time!PS: CASH ONLY.
Mariah C.}Long Beach, CA}22}127}19}-1}4}5/13/2008}I loved this place!The food was great and it was very cute inside.Further more.... the toilet was CRAZy!!!!It was the kind of toilet that had more buttons and offered more services than I new what to do with.

Buo Z.}New York, NY}490}921}703}-1}3}4/20/2008}This place is really tucked away and I almost missed it. It's right on the 2nd floor close to one of my fave Jap shabu shabu restaurants. My friends and I don't understand Japanese tradition, so when we ordered the 3 dessert item and we only got 1, we figured we misunderstood. But luckily about 15 min later we got the other 2 desserts. Needless to say, the desserts were bite-sized. Despite the food being nothing spectacular, the tea here was awesome. I don't remember what my friends or I had, but it was very good. Just come here with friends to sip tea and munch on bite-size desserts after dinner somewhere else, especially when you're trying to pass the time and have nothing better to do.
Mairead R.}Sacramento, CA}290}256}28}-1}3}4/18/2008}Up a narrow staircase and you'll be transported to a traditional Japanese teahouse. The walls are constructed like the thatched roofs and bamboo sidings of a Japanese lodging, complete with perfectly placed plants and hanging lanterns. Javier M. swoons about Cha An's magic appeal and I think the decor is responsible. A retreat from the madness of the east village, this tiny shop seats a cozy 20 people. While I visited patrons were speaking softly in Japanese, French, Russian, and English. The bar is lined with porcelain, glass, and metal teapots and teacups. Tools of the exotic and beautiful trade here. I ordered flower craft tea, a delicate flowering tea. Spiky green tea leaves are picked as young shoots in spring season and laced into tiny bundles with aromatic chrysanthemum blossoms. After immersion in steaming water, the blossoms gracefully unfold, providing a small ballet of brewing before your eyes. If you favor the rare osmanthus oolong from SW China or a blend of African Rooibis and Indian spicees, the tea menu provides detailed descriptions of each tea's origin, history, and flavor. I ordered the dessert sampler, which started with a mixed berry sorbet,. The acidic sugars held up fresh peaks of whipped cream. Although the sweetness marred the tea flavor, it was the best dessert. The black sesame brulee was flat, served cold and leaving a bitter aftertaste. The hot banana chocolate tart was all dough and no substance. A dribble of melted chocolate, two quarter sized banana slices, and a spoonful of whipped cream. The chocolate cookie, sliced like a refrigerator cookie, tasted of sprouts. Finally, the rice paste flour rolled in toasted rice flour was unusual but authentic. The winner was the macaroon, a glossy treat filled with red bean cream. Delicious and a sublime pairing with their sweet teas.
Aka C.}New York, NY}34}98}26}-1}5}4/17/2008}I figured if Cha-An is the default place that I bring my friends to when we're just roaming the village trying to find a place to hang out it's only proper that I dedicate my first Yelp review to it. The first time I went my friend and I just finished a filling lunch across the street at Sobaya. We just wanted a place to sit down and talk for a little while and my friend recommended Cha-An because she heard the tea and desserts were really great. Although we only ordered two teas that time, I knew I was definitely coming back to try their food.Tea: I've tried a few of their teas (Japanese and Chinese) but my absolute favorite is still the Jasmine Pearl. I actually felt a sense of CALM entering my system when I was drinking it. The tea is available for sale as well. The price is a bit hefty (I think around $9/oz), but if it works for you (we all need a bit of calm sometimes) then it's worth the money.Food: I love the Cha-An set A, which is 6 kinds of small dishes (to eat with the rice) with 15 grained rice. It's definitely satisfying as lunch. Cha-An set B, which is mix of salmon, shrimp, quiche, vegetables, soup, and rice, etc. is great as well. Chef's Choice Special is a great 3 desserts + tea set. The desserts vary (they change their selection around) but are generally tasty and very pretty to look at. Portions are not big, but perfect for light lunch and dessert (at any time). I've heard great things about the afternoon tea set but have yet to try it out.Setting: I love the bamboo and wood. The tables and seats settings are not too crowded and their little "hut" is the perfect spot for a deep conversation.Service: Great service. Once I had a small birthday celebration for my friend here. I asked the waitress in Japanese to prepare one of the special desserts of the day (black sesame crme brulee + earl grey pudding~ mmm) and put a candle (which I brought) on it. Not only did she do that, they also dimmed the lights while they were bringing the dessert out. Needless to say my friend was ecstatic. I don't think they even charged us for that dessert. The place gets a bit crowded after 8-9, so if you have a big group, be prepared to wait (if you get seated at all). Notes: Don't forget that this place is cash only. I've run into trouble because of that. Oh, and the bathroom is *nice*.
Jennifer L.}New York, NY}26}290}0}-1}4}4/14/2008}I've been passing by Cha An for a few years now, and only recently went in to check it out. Wow, look what I've been missing! Very Japanese in decor, feels very authentic. Cozy and cute, dark and comfy, like a little oasis from the craziness of the city. They have lots of food options, and of course, tea. I can't wait to go back and try the food. For my first visit, I had a pot of black tea and a couple of green tea macarons. Delicious! When you go, you MUST check out the restrooms. They have the fancy Japanese toilets. If you've never seen or experienced one, go now. It's so cool, so high tech, so Japanese. See for yourself and tell me you are not impressed, I dare you!
Michelle Q.}New York, NY}106}111}12}-1}5}4/10/2008}My first time at Cha-An I had the coolest tea set to make and pour my oolong tea. The tea set was displayed on top of a wooden box, and the waitress gave me a pleasant  tea lesson. I had the mini kettle, mini strainer, mini tall glass, tea cup, and a slender stick in case the leaves got stuck in the spout. It was awesome. It made Irri's delicious, naturally-sweet, tea boooring.Every visit I had was great. It's a comforting place with an extensive list of teas, and amazing desserts. I have yet to try their small dishes though. *Javier M. best describes Cha-An.
Javier M.}New York, NY}707}388}173}-1}5}4/2/2008}I remember the day I first went to Cha-An. Up we went through the small stairs, to the smallest reception/waiting area I've ever seen; and through the beige curtains I could see the promise of a magnificent realm, only that I didn't knew at the time that Cha-An was a magnetic kingdom and that It would never allow me, or my wallet, to refrain from coming back again and again...And I have. This is the story, then, of my unending fever for a place that knows no equal.Location. It is located in the perfect place around St. Marks; so accessible, and yet, so hidden... almost like an afterthought; you saunter too much, and you'll pass it by, never to try the delights that await you, but I'm getting ahead of myself.Beauty: Of course it has that feeling of zen; zen-sual lighting and minimalistic dark wood floors and seating; a very small bar to eat in front of the chef; and just 3 scant "private" dining spaces; Cha-An is very small, cozy and unpretentiously kingly. Or Queenly. Plants allocated here and there give it a touch of nature, and the overall mood is peace and relaxation... *aahhhhh*Food: I've tried their Lunch A and B, and let me tell you, it is strangely delicious; doesn't follow an standard Japanese food script, and it doesn't exactly follow any script but it's own; a mixture (blend really) of inspired cuisine from all takes, which yields an eclectic menu as if it was made for the remaining Royals of the House of Habsburg-Lothringen living in Budapest, Hungary.... several appetizers; egg custard, a small chirashi-like rice bowl, excellent miso, tuna steak don, or salmon tartare don, unagi, and a delicious and soft corn tart that would raise John Quincy Adams (who loved Corn and Fresh Fruits) from the dead... Try them all, and eat them all. And before we lead you to the sweets, let's remember that Cha-An specializes in...Teas: 60% of the menu is dedicated to a monstrous selection of teas; some yanked from the remotest places on earth; some bearing hefty price tags as they grow on special places and ONLY in special seasons; like the rare Yinzhen Silver Needle, carefully cultivated and with a rich nutty aroma, and though I am no expert, I would order a Matcha green tea, or a Osmanthus Oolong and I am a happy camper. And now the creme de la creme of Cha-An; desserts.With all the wise words you can get out of king Atif and other connoisseurs, I will limit myself to an eager salivation from my palate; do you understand that the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, or the Chocolate Souffle with Raspberry Sauce will make your sweet buds cum? Even the green tea macaroons and the pumpkin scones are delish and mouth watering even at 4:01am in the morning (the time of this review)So as you can see, I'm in love with this place, it's contents and everything else. Fit for royalty, presidents or just women who love to peruse of a Japanese Bidet to complete an otherwise, tantric experience.WhatCha-Answer? You may ask me. But Yelp only has 5 stars.
Michelle C.}Brooklyn, NY}33}95}0}-1}5}3/24/2008}Cha-an is probably one of the best kept secrets in the East Village.  If you are looking for a quiet, serene and intimate place to have a cup of tea by yourself or with a friend, Cha-an is definitely the place to go. I usually go there when I feel sad or need some piece of mind. The zen-like atmosphere is really soothing and a relief to the madness of life and what is New York City.While I would not purposely go to Cha-an for food, I must say their desserts and their cute Japanese-portioned entrees are tasty in my book! Cha-an is definitely a must try!
Kristi C.}Sydney, Australia}13}274}182}-1}5}3/22/2008}I love this tea house! A quiet, almost secret place to enjoy some great tea. The chocolate mochi nearly killed me (soooo rich!), YUM!
Shoshana S.}Bronx, NY}48}23}7}-1}5}3/19/2008}The perfect peaceful hideaway from the chaos of the city.Jazz of Coltrane's softer side and Ella Fitzgerald murmurs in the background as you enjoy the serene atmosphere of the Japanese teahouse. A menu of various teas awaits your discovery. I've been there a couple of times and enjoyed every visit. The chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is heavenly. I recommend doing the sauce as a shot. Also the sweet potato samosas are delicious too. I'm thrilled to have found such a gem of a place.
Maritess Z.}Seattle, WA}598}281}9}-1}5}3/14/2008}THEY KEEP THE SERVERS TIPS HERE. SLIP THE SERVERS MONEY SECRETLY SO THEY GET PAID!!!!!!!!!My friend works here, that's how I know. I love this place, so that's disappointing to hear they do things old school Asian communist way. That's how it was when I worked at a Korean restaurant illegally when I was 15, but that's another story.Otherwise, I love this authentic Japanese teahouse with beautifully presented and delicious teas and great deserts and snacks. Great secret esque location with real dark wood stairs Japanese style to climb up. Try the bidets--heaven! It was so naughty and pleasureable, go back for the bidets and amp up the power every time to see what you're made of.Small space, most time there is a wait, but a great place to take a date or friends to have sophisticated conversation in a nice dark atmosphere. I like the candles, the flowers, the real wood. If you've wondered what a teahouse in japan looks like, go to Cha-An.
Jamie S.}Philadelphia, PA}169}473}169}18}4}3/13/2008}Clearly if you come here you must have the black sesame creme brule. It is as good as everyone says it is. My friends ordered some unimpressive dim sum; so I suggest sticking with tea, sake, and dessert. There are some very reasonably priced sakes and (although on the expensive side for hot water and leaves) flavorful teas to please everyone. The early gray chocolate mochi was so tasty and different, but really intense, so it is a good thing to share.  There isn't  a wait before 630 on weeknights. Yes cash only, yes hilarious and amazing ladies bathroom. Oh, if you remember to ask, there is a weeknight happy hour special that gets you a few tiny but delicious snacks with an order of an alcoholic drink.
Kristina W.}New York, NY}13}201}17}-1}5}2/9/2008}A wonderful little Japanese tea house in Manhattan.  It is only big enough to hold about 20 people so if you come during a peak hour, expect a wait.  You can order 3 mini desserts or one normal size.  I'd recommend the 3 mini.  We tried to specify what 3 items we wanted but it didn't work.  The ice cream was the biggest surprise.  It was so flavorful and fresh.  The souffle was also excellent.  If you get the full size souffle, only add about half of the raspberry sauce b/c it doesn't need the whole thing.
Faith C.}Paris, France}38}88}7}-1}5}1/21/2008}The things you notice about an establishment the second time you visit it: the private tatami room usually occupied by Japanese women and the token man. Geisha lessons? Tea ceremony? I have no idea. But it was quite intriguing.I love everything about Cha An...the little menus, the presentation of the dishes, the quality of the food, the docile wait staff, the diversity of the cliente (ranging from yelpers to little Japanese couples), the open kitchen, even the heated bathroom bidet that sends me into a fit of pleasure (haha just kidding, I actually never tried the "pulsating back cleansing" button). Cha An is the quintessential slice of Japan, with about 5 pages of tea options in stock and a handful of amazing desserts. Oh yes, I'll be the 50934802 person who worships the black sesame creme brulee. I also loved the porridge and savory entrees-light, so very Japanese in portion size, and lovely in flavor. Echoing the previous reviews, this place is worth the wait.
Ting S.}Berkeley, CA}338}420}89}-1}5}1/20/2008}Make the special trip to the ladies' room.  If you can, make two.  It will complete and supplement your visit to this elegant establishment. If you are lucky enough to score one of the coveted dozen tables, that is!  The gods were generous the late afternoon we decided to check this place out. After being seated at the last empty table, we noticed that there was a constant stream of customers, but you would never guess the line of waiting, hopeful patrons from the hardly-rushed, calm service of all the staff. Orders taken, food and tea placed with impeccable delivery. We experienced the chef's assortment, a 3-course dessert parade with any choice of tea. The pu-erh tea was strong yet subtle, re-filled promptly three times, with the final pour offered after we paid, with a nod of encouragement to linger over 1 last cup of tea.  Excellent. The first course, sesame ice-cream with a sesame crisp was 2 very tasty, tiny scoops that fit into a shot glass.  Second course was easily the best, creme brulee and warm tapioca bean, in 2 separate containers.  The creme brulee was unforgettable! Third course was a sandwich of green tea cookies with a raisin creme in the middle. The sugar in the cookie was overwhelming, barely hiding the grainy texture.  Quickly recovered from the third course by a second trip to the bathroom.  Really a great experience overall, definitely a treat!Note: cash only
Scuba K.}Amityville, NY}12}210}1}-1}5}1/20/2008}I've visited this place a few times, and it's absolutely perfect if you're looking for something cozy and intimate.  Since the Cha-An is on the small side, you may have to wait a bit.  It's worth it though - the desserts are delicious; nuanced in flavor, slightly sweet with a delightful lightness.  Last night we went for some sake and lychee martini.  Mmmm...  If you do go, I highly recommend the lychee martini for a sweet treat.  I ordered the white peony tea, not my absolute favorite as I prefer a strong tea, but my dining companion enjoyed her green tea.Oh and it's cash only.
Junkfoodie Q.}NY, NY}12}372}0}-1}4}1/12/2008}4.25 stars.I ordered the jasmine tea thinking I'd be able to see the jasmine flower blossoming beautifully in my tea cup.It didn't.  But my friend's flower blossomed!  I think she had the "blossom tea" or something like that.  That makes sense, right?  To order the "blossom tea" and then you'd be able to see the blossom? Hmmmm.Anyways, my tea was still delicious.  We also ordered the dessert and shared about 4 desserts between the 4 of us.  The black sesame creme brulee was awesome, and the chocolate (?) mochi was also yummy.  They will also give you more hot water if you'd like refills of your tea.Small and cozy place, great place to come with a date and try something different!
Eric C.}New York, NY}47}140}0}-1}5}1/8/2008}A great place (especially for dates) that is unique and fresh.  It accomplishes what the Japanese do the best:  Complete attention to detail.  I had the best cup of chai I've ever had - it was perfectly balanced in terms of creaminess, sweetness, and spiciness.  We all shared the dessert sampler and had an awesome black sesame creme brule.Definitely worth a visit.
Jessica A.}Brooklyn, NY}85}181}0}-1}5}1/2/2008}This place was awesome. I love tea. Tea is delicious. My jasmine tea was some of the best I have ever had. And, don't get me started on the mochi.I will certainly be back, even if just for another trip to the bathroom with the automatic toilet. I think I used it 3 times.
Natalia M.}Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY}240}178}36}-1}5}11/16/2007}Devotees know patience, which in this case is the key to unlocking Cha-an's beauty and discovering its secrets. A fast-paced passerby in search of something exciting will walk past the restaurant's humble facade. But if you are lucky enough to stop, open the door,  walk up a staircase, and pull away two thick, square curtains hanging down mid-waist, Cha-an's warmth will encompass you immediately. Dim lit and quiet, the room is filled with wooden square tables and Japanese simplicity. Bartenders pour sake into mojitos, and, with the utmost care and precision, chefs create delicacies in the kitchen right behind. I sat int the midst of the scene, feeling like I had entered a beautiful sanctuary. A chocolate souffle covered in raspberry sauce was placed before me. For five minutes, it looked too sacred in its delicate beauty for me to desecrate it.  But when it started deflating, I knew it was time. I broke into it with my spoon and tasted a flow of sweet chocolate with a touch of cool raspberry. I burned my tongue over and over, but I didn't mind. Delightful to the senses, it promised the sins would be forgiven later. I only came here for dessert, and when I left, I felt satisfied. Not like a glutton feels satisfied after he pushes the empty death by chocolate crumb-filled plate aside and pops the first pants button open. But like a student, walking in the cold, yet glowing with that quiet satisfaction of just having had the first taste of knowledge from a wise master. There are more secrets here. I know it, because Cha-an's delicate, heartwarming creations whispered it to me. And like a true devotee, addicted to knowledge--and precious flavors--I'll listen and return.
Atif I.}New York, NY}173}640}1714}18}5}11/7/2007}Six weeks back I received a compliment late at night from Maria M which amused me no end. "I was notified last night that you have not yet been to Cha-An.  That is unacceptable, if you are to crown yourself the "Dessert King". Let's make time to go". I wondered: Could it be that I've actually made the Big League? Not the minor business of crowning myself the "Dessert King" (conferred by The Weekly NYC Yelp, mind you), but of actually getting an invite from The C.O.T.! Euphoric at the prospect of the cult initiation, I immediately sent in my consent form, which absolved them of the adverse effects of any hazing ritual (other than Roddy's jokes, or featuring in Audrey's reviews!)All jokes aside, I have enormous respect for the C.O.T. They are an immensely entertaining group of people - friendly, loyal, adventurous, and always up for fun. But, most of all, one has to commend their dedication to yelp. Not too many people know that between Joolie, Julie, Roddy, Javier, Audrey, and Maria a total of 1299 local photos have been contributed to yelp! I got firsthand initiation to this at Cha-an. No sooner had the desserts arrived that Julieholic shouted "Picture", and while this idiot thought people were going to huddle up and smile - all I got was a tight slap on the wrist from her for unwittingly obstructing the camera! Cameras flashing all around me captured the glory of the exquisitely crafted desserts. Joolie T had ordered for me the Cha-An Toast with azuki and whipped cream and topped with Jasmin ice cream. The others covered the entire range: The Black Sesame Creme Brulee, The Sweet Potato Apple cake with Caramel ice cream, The Earl Grey Chocolate Mochi and the Chocolate Souffle with Raspberry reduction sauce.As I looked at the three inch high slices of the toast and whipped cream, I wondered whether I would be able to do it justice. But, the toast just crumbles softly in your mouth allowing you to savor each bite and relish the accompanying Jasmin ice cream. I was most pleasantly surprised by my drink, a Sake Mojito, which has to be the best Mojito I've had in the city. (For those interested to know: Julieholic did NOT steal it away!)As part of the Atif I. certification process, I came here next in the company of Snarky V and Vic. On this occasion I ordered the Creme Brulee topped with black sesame ice cream. This HAS to be the best in its class in NYC. Truly a showstopper! The slightly warmer custard topped by the crackly brulee layer and the melting ice cream just tickle your taste buds with the blend of textures and temperatures. Absolutely Perfect! Now, I am not a tea drinker, but even I was tempted by the strong Cardamom smell from Vic's tea. Certainly, tea connoisseurs would find the 30 odd options at Cha-an as enchanting. There is even a private room for a tea ceremony. As we glanced around the tea house, we were reminded of the calm and serenity of a tea house in Japan, and to achieve that in the hustle and bustle of East Village is extremely commendable.And, as if the ladies needed another excuse to leave with a smile on their face, they have a Japanese bidet for amusement. There is none for the men, perhaps out of apprehension of lawsuits from inadvertently pressing the ATR button. Yes, go ahead Google the joke ("A man traveling by plane") as I think about that Black Sesame Creme Brulee. Mmmm.
Dorim L.}Chicago, IL}103}546}3}-1}3}11/3/2007}This place is very cute but I didn't like the table settings.  My friend had a fountain behind his chair and it was very hard for him to move around his seat.  We tried the chef dessert 3-course tray.  It was okay.  I thought the desserts were good but the ice cream at the beginning of the course wasn't quality; it tasted like Breyer's you get in a supermarket.  Also, our waitress didn't speak English at all so when I was trying to get information on what the chef desserts were, she had a hard time explaining it to us.  When our teas finally arrived, it came in a unique tea pot but unfortunately, it's not an appropriate pot for tea.  Why?  Because it wasn't a pot that could insulate the heat so eventually our tea was luke warm.  They have the right idea but they need to use more quality ingredients and better pots for this place to be on par with the amount that they charge.
Amy Y.}New York, NY}150}121}0}-1}3}11/1/2007}This place is a little gem in the midst of the East Village madness.  It is located a little bit away from the crowded part of town (though not too far away, so still convenient) and is a great breath of fresh air from the chaotic atmosphere outside.  They have great lunch/dinner "sets", dishes and fabulous desserts that go great with their great selection of teas.  Even the dessert comes in sets (3 for ~$16) and are unique and delicately created.I can't give this place 4-5 stars because I don't want to mislead people into coming here without aligning on expectations.  The place does not get that many stars because of  1. the decor: small with minimal accents and a makeshift tea room and 2. its prices:  I ordered Japanese powdered green tea, which came in a large bowl filled with tea less than the liquor that comes in mini-shot bottles on the plane for $12.  $12.  That's a whole meal or 2 chicken-and-rice's.   I know this is New York, but $12 for a sip of tea?  Ridiculous.
Jack L.}New York, NY}108}112}0}-1}4}10/25/2007}Great tea selection. Great atmosphere. Great black sesame creme brulee. The other desserts are your run of the mill mo chi, biscuits, strawberry shortcakes.
Ken C.}New York, NY}49}651}2}-1}3}10/20/2007}I went there last week.  It was a unique place and very nice dessert.  I didn't know about this place until someone told me.  However, I think it was a little pricy and still a nice place to take your date there after a dinner and a slow walk.
Kristine d.}Claremont, CA}173}24}4}-1}5}10/15/2007}japanese bidets... i hearts them.We ordered the afternoon tea menu and the dessert menu.  in the tea menu we had two sandwiches, an array of desserts, and a tea of our choice. Since we were visiting NY on a balmy weekend, we opted for the iced green tea.  mmmm smooth and refreshing.  The sandwiches - one tea smoked salmon and the other jam and cream cheese were served on a mini-bagel instead of the traditional crusts-off white bread (i guess cuz we were in ny?) but they were tasty! Chewy bagel, savory salmon & creamy cream cheese and sweet jam.  But the highlight of the meal was definitely the sweets.  Mocha cookie that was crumbly and mochalicious. a green tea macaroon with azuki (redbean) filling-yum.  My favorite was the chocolate chip scone... WARM and SWEET.  They doubled up on the chocochip scone on my order because i'm allergic to sesame seeds (i do not heart sesame seeds - works of the deevil) but from what my friend and sister said, they thought the chocolate chip scone was the best too....and the japanese bidet... you're fantastic.
Carrie C.}Los Angeles, CA}270}613}1000}-1}3}10/11/2007}I found this place on Yelp before I headed for NYC.  I was so exicited to go and realized it was some blocks away from my friend's apartment.  I trekked there by myself in anticipation of the sweet Japanese desserts (since Kyotofu failed to satisfy the night before).  I got there at noon and I was the first in the restaurant-traditional Japanese decor.  I was only planning on ordering the whole menu of dessert but since I hadn't eaten yet, so I settled on the lunch set.  First came the egg, mushroom quiche which was pretty good, except it was lukewarm.  Then came the potato and this one thing that I don't really know what it's called in English.  Both were ok, but disappointing because it's something I eat at home.  Then came the main tray with string beans, tea marinated salmon, rice and soup.  The rice, beans and soup (tomato and egg) are things my mom makes at home.  Tastes exactly the same.  Then the fish, I didn't expect it to be raw for some reason and I don't eat raw fish.  I was pissed because I forced two slices down my throat because I hate wasting food.  It was actually marinated fairly well, I could have imagined liking it if I liked raw fish.  Everything came in cute traditional Japanese plates/bowls but it was all too disappointing.  Then my hopes were brought up again at the thought of the black sesame creme brulee which came with the set.  It had really mild sesame taste which was unique to any other brulee's I've had (the best was a lychee creme brulee in Vegas..sounds weird but SO DELICIOUS) but not the best.   My meal also came with a tea which I requested cold chrysanthemum tea but it was really watered down and had no flavor to it.  I think I was just expecting alittle too much maybe, and it all just fell short.  I would love to come back though and try the other desserts, especially the toast.  I almost ordered it but I was so full.  Oh, and this is a cash only place so make sure you bring plenty.
Julie G.}Los Altos, CA}0}104}0}-1}2}10/4/2007}i must have missed the cha-an boat. it's small, hot, and fussy. i did not feel serene or relaxed at all :(
Reyna A.}Washington, DC}43}69}3}-1}4}10/3/2007}This was a great casual date place.  Not a problem getting seated on a week night.  A neat unique experience to have Japanese tea and dinner.  I had green tea and it was excellent.  We ordered the reisei gayu as recommended by a fellow reviewer.  Some of the items were really tasty.  Others were not.  There was a slimey seaweed item that had an unpleasant texture.  But the desserts were divine.  I recommend the black sesame creme brulee and the chocolate mochi.  Yum...
Tim T.}New York, NY}179}58}0}-1}5}9/22/2007}When you run around the chaos of Manhattan, you need some corners in the city to hide away and regain your sanity. Cha-An offers a few remedies for your developing schizophrenia problem. First, the quiet atmosphere shuts out all of the noise from the city; here, you won't find the patrons yelling at each other unless its in laughter, and the staff will move slowly but diligently for the service. Second, the tea itself cleanses and soothes you in a way that other drinks that we typically consume in the city (coffee and alcohol) cannot. I think most holistic practices are a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but Cha-An truly does encompass what one needs for the mind, body, and soul.
Seth U.}Brooklyn, NY}16}42}0}-1}5}9/2/2007}First and foremost, this place is a teahouse. Their tea is good. Very very good. It's unassuming, fancier than it needs to be and delicious. But really. Tea House. There aren't that many in this city. This one gets it right.
Ann H.}Los Angeles, CA}63}67}8}-1}5}8/27/2007}Wow, I love this place!! I stopped by here last week after dinner because I keep seeing everyone review it. We went up the stairs, and snatched up the last empty table :)Looking through the menu, I seriously wanted to order everything! Finally decided on the sakura flan, but to my dismay the waitress told me that was not available that day. So I got the black sesame creme brulee and my friend go the french toast with red beans. The creme brulee was great, but a bit redundant. It had sesame ice cream on top and the creme brulee sesame filling tasted exactly like the ice cream. However, I am now obsessed with the french toast!! Imagine the most fragrant bakery ever, the creamiest bread that melts in your mouth, mixed with delicious red beans and whipped cream. Oh my god, it is the best ever and it will haunt you for days and make your mouth water just thinking about it!! Yes, I'll definitely be back. They also have an extensive beverage menu that I can't wait to try, and also a dinner set menu that seemed really good.
Maria M.}New York, NY}247}509}52}-1}5}8/21/2007}The one thing I hate about Cha-An: The LOOOONG wait to get a table.  That's probably because I always go there with 4-5 people.  But whatever.  It is worth the wait.The tea selection is quite thorough.  I've only had the lavender-chamomile (or something lavender-y), and it was very strong yet soothing.  I've also had the early grey "float", which was not a float and just basically iced tea.  A $7 iced tea.  Steer clear.The standouts are the desserts.  There are so many great choices, and all of them made so well and so nicely, that you almost don't want to eat it.  The first time I was there, I got the earl grey chocolate mochi (see picture).  So cute!  And there was an extra mochi hidden within the leaf on the plate.  Adorable.  The chocolate was a bit much, so don't be like me and try to speed-eat.  Savor......The second time around, I got the black sesame creme brulee.  Amazing!  I tried some of Joolie's Cha-An toast with azuki and whipped cream.  Delicious!  I am definitely getting that next time around.The servers have always been kind and courteous.  But you might have to enunciate and say what you want multiple times.  i think Joolie had to tell our waitress "Azuki" about 5-6 times before she got it.  But again - no matter! This has been discussed over and over, I know.  It is not an exaggeration.  Ladies, DO NOT leave without trying the bidet.  A perfect end to a perfect evening, let me tell you......
Sean T.}New York, NY}21}86}64}-1}5}8/20/2007}Recommended for:  lunch/dinner/snacks with friends, good tea.Food 5, Service 5, Ambiance 4.Cha-An didn't let me down.  Walking up a steep staircase, you enter a japanese oasis.  We were seated toward the back, and the restaurant was quite.  The menus come in a big book.  The majority of the book is dedicated to all the types of tea that they have.  After a little while, we finally decide.  I really like places that are truly authentic, and authentic in look, food and service.  The waitstaff spoke japanese, the bathroom had the bidet from japan (push button robo toilet - sorry guys, we don't have it), and the food and tea - AWESOME!Ordered the matcha green tea float (tastes like cool melted greentea icecream - very yummy), a chocolate soufle with rasberry pure (rich and delicious), black sesame creme brule w/black sesame icecream (HOLY MOLY THIS WAS AMAZING!) and I got green tea from Kyoto.This hit the sweet spot.  My waitress checked up on me every 10 or 15 minutes to ask if I wanted more tea.  They served the tea in a little pot that has enough water for one cup; but that is one cup of truly delicious tea.I thought we had the best black sesame creme brule and ice-cream at Sakagura, but Cha-An, you have taken that title!  For amazing tea, desserts, service and more, check out Cha-An.  I'll be back to try the regular food, which I can only imagine, is just as good as everything else.Sean Approved:  Zettaini ita houga ii yo!!!
Julie K.}New York, NY}226}418}883}-1}5}8/12/2007}update: you have to try their summer special, Reisei Gayu, set (rice served in cold bonito broth): 1 pot of tea +1 soup + 1 rice bowl + 6 appetizers + 1 desert = $17!!! Cha-An toast with azuki and whipped cream + Jasmin ice cream:  OMG!!! it's simply AWESOME!=================================================my grandma, mom's side, was a Japaneses - Korean, and she'd visited us many times when I was little.at that time, my everyday wish was..  wanted to live with her, cuz she always gave me non-sweet Japanese snack..  she knew how to threat a little girl well..when Joolie T. told us we were going to try this hidden gem, I didn't expect much..   I know where I can find BEST mochi ice cream, I know where I can find BEST black sesame ice cream, and I know where I can find BEST green tea ice cream in town..  oh, God!  I LOVE ice cream!!!  oops.. better go back to Cha-An review..I wasn't that good mood, besides, we had to wait around 30 minutes to get the seats..  felt kinda bad.. sitting on the stairs..  but those wait staffs were keeping us with smiling..finally, we got a big table, and were ready to kill some sugar!the menu book was thick, and so many choices, deserts yet.we got most of choices.. like Black Sesame Cream Brulee, Green Tea Truffles, Earl Grey Chocolate Mochi, Green Tea Macaroon with Red Bean etc..  those little Green Tea Macaroon made me missing grandma a lot..  we were happy to try all of them and share each others..everything was just perfectly prepared, and of course not over-sweeted like other Japanese deserts!moreover, we fell in love with the bidet, Japanese TOILET, only for WOMEN..  sorry, men~
Dina L.}New York, NY}93}87}3}-1}4}7/29/2007}One of my favorite, tucked-away  places in the city - a gem of a cozy, delicious tea place/restaurant that has a clean aftertaste of a spa experience.Everything in Cha-An is worthwhile (maybe because the menu is tiny and changes almost daily). From appetizers to soups to lunch specials to deserts- everything offered is fresh and delicious. I love the fact that after 8pm they sometimes run out of their savory tea-smoked salmon, because that mean they get it delivered daily. The $10 lunch special from 5 to 7 is a great deal- rice with meat or fish of the day, small appetizers and green tea. Deserts range from heavenly (green tea truffles, chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce, creme brulee) to just good (everything else). The tea selection is thought-out and always fresh. My favorite is the silver needle white, tibetian purree and osmoth. oolong.
Cheryl C.}Chicago, IL}23}152}11}-1}5}7/29/2007}Japanese-style bathrooms! What more do you want??Okay, beyond that, Cha-An is just cool. It starts with its tucked-away second-floor location and continues in its classic Japanese decor, which manages to be intimately dark-toned yet open and illuminated at the same time. Don't ask me how they do it. Then there's the lovely tea house enclosure in the main sitting room, which is available for small groups to rent for several hours.There are several nice ways to do Cha-An: tea, lunch or dessert. The tea menu is perfection for the tea connoisseur, focusing on high-quality and authentic Japanese and Chinese teas, including sencha, hojicha, genmaicha, matcha (!), oolong and jasmine. Lunch is unremarkable in my opinion. The desserts are wonderful, perfectly proportioned and balanced. I had a chocolate banana tart with orange ice cream and it was amazing: warm, a little melty, not too sweet, not too big, the citrus preventing the chocolate from being overwhelming.Don't miss the opportunity to have the decadent Japanese bathroom experience....
Michael K.}Houston, TX}41}146}0}-1}4}7/25/2007}A hidden gem just off the hustle and bustle of St. Mark's Place.  The minuscule scale is evident the moment you climb the dark, narrow staircase.  The food is wonderful, and no, there is no sushi involved.  For once, it's good to see a Japanese restaurant show that there are other dishes that can be just as good, though I think there could be a little more variety.  The creme brulee for dessert is a must.The tea selection is wonderful, by far eclipsing the food menu.  While I've developed a bit of uneasiness ordering tea gong-fu style (the care involved is something that I've yet to master), the experience is certainly worth the initial confusion.  It's easy to see why the British have developed their own (albeit completely different) way to celebrate of tea.
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}5}7/4/2007}This is one of the other Soba-Ya owned restaurants. He has several in the city. All the restaurants offer different Japanese taste and authentically delicious. When I went to this restaurant, it was the day they offering Tea ceremony. Then, I saw a lady in Kimono. She came over and greeted us. She remembered me from Soba-Ya and told me that she is a manager of Cha-An now. I thought it is such a great gesture of the owner's recognition and appreciation to his staff. It tells a lot about the restaurant and see the reason for the restaurants success.We each had a set menu ($19). We loved ours. For my tea choice, I asked for highest caffeinated green tea. The many dishes after were tastefully presented in a basket try and memorable and we ended with perfect desserts. I took my Mom for Mother's Day and she was impressed.(12/29/07)My husband mother and her husband joined lunch with us here. I had a set menu A. It comes with three sliced marinated salmon slices with thin shredded Daikon, miso soup with mussels with Russell sprouts. It was interesting combo but the broth was so flavorsome that made this soup delicious! The many grained steamed rice and the stir-fried vegetables. The stir-fried was least of my favorite but bitterness from Chinese broccoli or it maybe Rapini (Italian broccoli) was nice touch. The eggplant was too bland. I had usual Sencha (dark green tea with high in caffeine) with my meal. All the dishes that came today missed cares that I used to see in their foods. When I remembered, the chefs behind the counter/kitchen were all woman chefs and there were three of them. I thought it was unusual but when the dishes came out, it had great care in each dishes. This visit, there were only 2 chefs and they were all male. There was a new waiter that had a bang and kinna cute but she was lacking of sophistication in serving that I used to see in this place. I should have mentioned to the manager, Motoko, but we didn't have much time. I might mention to her later...On the way out, I peeked in the teahouse. They were all in kimono and received some teas....that was priceless. Everyone told me that they loved theirs and wanted to go back again.
Tracy X.}New York, NY}49}137}1}-1}5}6/11/2007}I'm a sucker for tea houses and constantly wishing there were more in this city. Cha-An has a very quiet and intimate atmosphere. While they offer a pretty extensive collection of teas, they are neatly organized by black, green, white, etc. My friend and I tried the White Peony as well as the Jasmine Pearls, both were very high quality teas. We noticed they also don't mind you sharing a pot for 2 and are very quick with re-filling it with boiling water. My friend and I had a huge dinner so decided to just share a dessert, ultimately deciding on the black sesame creme-brulee. It's your normal brulee with a hint of toasted black sesame taste topped with black sesame ice cream, absolutely delicious.
Lynn W.}New York, NY}110}168}69}-1}3}5/29/2007}Quite dissapointed, I have heard so many good things about this place and decided to give it at try at last. It turned out to be quite dissapointing. I had the set menu for dinner. The portions were way too small, it was almost a joke. For my 6-dish-entree, i literally had a plum as one entree. I dont think i will go back.
Elizabeth B.}New York, NY}51}412}0}-1}5}5/10/2007}I took my mom here on for a nice little tea.  We each got the omakase dessert menu, which we later found out is customized to your tea selection.  Everything was delicious and served so nicely.  We got there right at 2 as they opened and had the pick of the restaurant.  Highlights were earl-grey mochi with chocolate fondant on the inside.  Black sesame creme brulee.  Homemade icecreams in flavors like fresh berry and black sesame, with little homemade sesame cookies on top.  The green-tea macaroon...I think I just named everything we had!  I was also glad we ordered vastly different teas so we could share everything!  I will definitely be back.Just remember: bring cash.
Lisa C.}NY, NY}110}204}40}-1}3}5/10/2007}oh man i was in need of good healthy food. well prepared, excellent service, it was a bit too warm which i didnt like, there was finally a breeze and i felt like i could breathe again. its great for one-on-one conversation. The chef special meal was great.... i liked it uh lawt!   i think no reservations and i think only cash... double check/ I plan to  check out the teas and dessert another day.
Lucy l.}New York, NY}18}58}0}-1}5}4/23/2007}This is a small place so expect a line, but it is worth the wait. I love the decor especially the greenhouse. It was a learning experience. The food & drinks is good, yet small portions. Another reason to stop by is that the tea is freshly brewed.ahh.... the joy of fine tea.GREEN TEA   The term "green tea" is used to describe a lot of different items.  In Japan, one type of green tea is consumed daily as part of regular meals.  Another type of green tea is used in the traditional tea ceremony.  They have little articles discuss all aspects of green tea, green tea cultivation, and the benefits of drinking green tea.JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY   Known as chanoyu in Japanese, the traditional Japanese Tea Ceremony is a chance for friends to gather in a harmonious environment and reflect upon the simple joys of friendship and the beauty of nature.JAPANESE TEA GARDENS   This is a special type of Japanese garden that is used during the traditional tea ceremony.  The tea garden surrounds a teahouse and emphasizes seasonal beauty and a somewhat misty atmosphere.
Tiffany T.}New York, NY}33}230}2}-1}5}4/19/2007}I love, love, LOVE this place!  The ambiance is so very mellow and intimate.  Best for one-on-one time with your best friend or your signif other.  Very attentive service if they are not busy.  There can be a wait since the place is pretty small.The food is excellent.  Small portions but each bite is extremely tasty.  I love how the flavors are perfectly balanced.  They had an entire meal for $17 to $20.  If you go before 7 pm, you can try their afternoon special or afternoon tea special.  The first is a rice bowl with some sort of protein (salmon, chicken, unagi).  Rice is sooooo good.  Comes with Genmaicha.  The latter seems to be English-influenced with two types of sandwiches, baked goods, sample of desserts, and choice of tea.Happy hour from...4 or 5 to 7 pm.  Buy a drink and get free appetizers.Believe me, you're going to want to go for lunch...and dinner....and afternoon tea....and late-night dessert....
Alice M.}London, United Kingdom}174}193}32}-1}5}4/15/2007}This place is great just about any time of day, for lunch, a mid-afternoon snack, dessert, after dinner tea... and definitely well worth the wait. It's less busy on weekday afternoons, where people often go to do a lil reading or work.The tea selection is amazing... and their desserts... *yum*  :oDTheir Earl Grey mochi is pure delight... and if you happen to stop in the women's restroom, they have those wonderful Japanese toilet seat warmers that make you want to stay in there all night!
Jean H.}New York, NY}23}129}17}-1}3}3/20/2007}i liked this place a lot. we went pretty late at night on a weekday, so it was almost empty. basically, lots of quality tea, cute and light and not too sweet desserts, and a few interesting drink concoctions (red bean latte with green tea anyone?). i had the crimson milk chai which i liked because it wasn't too sweet. what i liked best here was that nothing felt like it was artificially sweetened to death or too creamy. very asian tastes but still catered to a broader appeal.
R K.}San Francisco, CA}34}186}16}-1}5}2/11/2007}This is a hidden little place that even complete guides of New York miss on occasion. It's a lovely tea shop...perhaps not for a meal but for a snack.Must-have: Earl Grey mochi = heavenly.
Mike W.}Los Angeles, CA}12}45}0}-1}5}1/25/2007}This place has an endless selection of hard to find Asian teas.  Amazing teahouse for tea lovers. Make sure you try the deserts too since they come from sakagura. Chocolate souffle is a must try.  it's on the 2nd floor across the street from soba-ya
T K.}New York, NY}5}59}0}-1}4}1/22/2007}very cozy atmosphere. it's located on the second floor above some bar or a restaurant that places very loud bass music. don't worry though as the music doesn't start kicking until well after 10p. saturday night was my first (hopefully of many) introduction to cha-an. i got the yinzhen silver needle white tea and it had such a subtle but full flavor that was just so refreshing. i don't profess to be a tea steward but i do enjoy a hot cup of tea. and paired with the earl grey chocolate mochi, which are kinda rich, it was a fantastic end to an memorable evening. i even heard the women's restroom had one of those automatic toilets, the kind where you push a button it practically does everything for you, well, short of wiping your ass. my goal for next time is to sneak in there for have a looksee for myself. perhaps even enjoy the wonders of the automatic toilet.
camilla c.}New York, NY}171}336}1}-1}4}11/24/2006}What a perfect little gem of a place... tucked away upstairs, Cha-An is a sweet little Asian tea house complete with an extensive tea menu (to make you feel like a tea sommelier) and a decent menu of dim sum and dessert items, as well as cocktails.  This is a perfect place to go with your mom or a girlfriend or two.  I'm going to guess guys won't appreciate it all that much... though I have seen a decent number of guys sipping tea there.I would come here simply for the earl grey chocolate mochi dessert... so heavenly!  And it goes perfectly with tea.  I've tried a Taiwanese oolong (served traditional style... try it, you'll get a kick out of the process) and a Japanese sencha.  Both were great... though I admit, most tea taste fairly similar to me.  But maybe after several more visits, I'll be able to distinguish the difference.  Great alternative place to the ubiquitous Starbucks or going to a bar after dinner.
alisa o.}San Francisco, CA}17}64}26}-1}5}9/8/2006}enchanting atmosphere, exquisite  desserts and a mind-boggling variety of teas - what more can you ask for?
payton c.}Washington, DC}11}64}1}-1}4}9/5/2006}Intimate, calming tea house with an emphasis on traditionally presentated, rare Asian teas -- a welcome respite from the East Village bustle below. As mentioned, you can request ($15 per person) a formal Japanese tea ceremony, with bowls of matcha and mochi pastries, in the Lilliputian wooden teahouse that fills half the dining room. We also had a Taiwanese oolong served on an elaborate tray, to be brewed in a three-step process that some might find fussy. (You can also have it served in a conventional pot, though.) Cash only.
Cindy H.}Bellevue, WA}36}60}35}-1}5}6/25/2006}Hidden away on the second floor of the popular East Village dining district, this Japanese tea house is so unique that it's as if you are sipping tea in a tea house in Kyoto.  The wonderful tea aroma and the serene ambiance makes this place idea for a special date with friends (limited to only small number of friends).  Although small, it comes complete with a tea room and superb selection of Asian tea.  But my favorite has to be their artistically and deliciously prepared Japanese dessert course.  The 3 course dessert omakase with tea pairing is heavenly as the chef delicately prepares variety of desserts and surprises you with gentle and fresh flavors.  I've been there several times with 1 or 2 other friends and we've never been served the same dessert as one another.The service is always excellent and the chef even offers private cooking classes on weekdays.  Japanese tea ceremony is performed every Friday and Sunday (see their website for detailed schedule) so not only can you enjoy delicious tea but also learn about the art of tea making and drinking.

Eddie G.}Los Angeles, CA}111}33}30}-1}1}5/8/2018}Horrible customer service. Definitely will never come back. Came here with a friend to try for the first time. First off, being told that we have to wait outside in the cold for our table was the least of the problems that happened. After being seated, we were greeted by our waiter who seemed bothered by having to serve our table. No smile, no hello, just this blank stare and slight nod to whatever we ordered. I noticed that all the servers were preparing the food for their tables. My fiend had been before so was familiar with the process, so she just started adding things to the hot pot. They didn't seem to mind. We prepared our entire meal without the help from the staff. Bill comes, $112 for two people. Cool. Their receipts have boxes to check which have the tip included and calculated for easy adding. My friend and i agreed that i would leave the tip. I got confused by the system and by mistake only left a 10% tip. Again, by mistake, but there was still a tip. A waitress comes to our table and asks "um, did we do something wrong?" With an attitude and condescending tone. We replied with a no. She then said "oh well you didn't tip enough." Excuse me? Pretty sure tipping is optional and pretty sure we prepared our whole meal by ourselves either way. It was embarrassing. I quickly added more to the receipt so that it was a 20% tip. She nodded and walked away. Such a rude and embarrassing experience. Definitely will never return. Oh and the food was good...but again...we cooked the whole thing ourselves so there's that.
KM K.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}1}-1}2}5/5/2018}Decoration very Japan local store, but the rice not japan texture and sauce served seems diluted. Indeed the ice cream is excellent. No queue at all. Overall average.
Marina S.}Beausoleil, France}0}3}0}-1}1}4/16/2018}This is probably the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. Absolutely dirty restaurant. It is owned by Japanese, he gives his friends or particular customers the best tables? Really shameful and sickening restaurant,I would never ever return here to this dirty dump.
Brian Michael M.}Downtown, Los Angeles, CA}30}9}6}-1}4}4/1/2018}Party of two on Sunday at 5:00PM and waited about 1 hour. They take reservations for parties of four or more. We each got a prime beef shabu shabu. It comes with assorted vegetable, salad and ice cream. Great value for food. Service was ok. I asked for extra rice and the waiter said it was $1 and it showed up on the bill for $3. Not upset about the price but would rather him tell me the correct answer.we were seated downstairs and you can't do BBQ downstairs.)
Farah K.}Sunnyside, NY}0}79}722}18}3}3/29/2018}Shabu-Tatsu, located in East Village is a DIY (do-it-yourself) Japanese dining experience that specializes in Japanese beef. First time having hot pot and was definitely disappointed. Although I am sure this type of meal is delicious to many, I did not find it appetizing! Everything about my food was bland except for the Gyoza (Pan-fried dumplings) and the Green tea ice cream. Staff was very kind and assisted immediately as soon as I told him I was new to this. Otherwise, there was nothing special about this place. I will have to visit a Chinese hot pot location before giving the whole hot pot theme a thumbs down.
C F.}Manhattan, NY}6}93}72}-1}2}3/17/2018Updatedreview}Quality has gone significantly since last review, went from visiting almost weekly to avoiding them as much as we can. As more hotpot and shabu places pop up in the city, shabu tatsu shys amongst competition
J L.}Edgewater, NJ}0}6}0}-1}4}3/16/2018}I love their sukiyaki waygu  the meat is amazing with the right amount of fat .. theor shabu shabu is also very delicious
Crystal Z.}Manhattan, NY}29}2}0}-1}5}2/28/2018}Very delicious sukiyaki hot pot! The beef in eggyolk is very smooth and tasty. We also had BBQ but I love sukiyaki more. Might be my fav in town.
Estelle Z.}New York, NY}184}83}268}18}5}2/25/2018}Authentic sukiyaki pot- best wagyu I have had recently for sukiyaki places, literally melt in mouth with silly eggyolk. It was so good that two of us finished three orders of beef. Green tea ice cream was the right amount of sweet and bitter- would be great if they had more dessert options!
Kevin T.}Downtown, San Diego, CA}7}9}5}-1}1}2/24/2018}Terrible service. Refuses to clear tables with customers who are loitering and drinking water. We have been waiting over 2 and a half hours and they continue to put the burden back on the customers who are waiting. Terrible
Min-Wei L.}Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY}4}3}1}-1}4}2/24/2018}We had the sukiyaki and it was DELICIOUS. Perfect for a group meal. Our waiter was very attentive and practically made everything for us at the table  a little on the pricier side but totally worth it for quality ingredients.
Al L.}New York, NY}0}86}69}-1}4}2/21/2018}The shop opens at 5pm for dinner, with a line already formed. There was an hour wait before getting in. When inside, there's the main floor and a smaller lower floor. Servers there are attentive and prep the sukiyaki for you. You also manage a little of it yourself. It comes with raw egg that you can dip your food in. The meat and veggies are delicious. The meal comes with a small bowl of ice cream SoEats:Sukiyaki (comes with rice and veggies) with porkSukiyaki with prime ribeye beefClear noodles
Kristyn K.}Manhattan, NY}27}79}20}-1}4}2/6/2018}When I lived in San Francisco I had shabu once a week at least. It's the #1 thing that I miss about home. Shabu-Tatsu is a completely different style of Shabu but still stops the cravings until I can get home again. I do wish they had different flavors of broth and some more variety in the meat and veggies that they serve, but they also serve more than just shabu so I guess I can understand it being more limited.
Janie Y.}New York, NY}153}1}0}-1}5}1/30/2018}I've been a loyal customer since 2010. It's definitely the best Shabu Shabu in Manhattan!
Lily L.}Los Angeles, CA}545}152}175}18}5}1/29/2018}We came right at 5PM on Sunday night and our party of three was seated immediately. Make sure your entire party is present, as they will not seat you until everyone is there.We got the sukiyaki with prime rib eye beef; for $29 per person, it can seem a bit pricey but the quality of the food is worth it - and the ice cream scoop at the end doesn't hurt! The meat alone was so delicious, and I would have been satisfied eating that and only that if I had to. That being said, the vegetables did not disappoint. They serve the sukiyaki with rice and a salad, and you can also dip the meat in a raw egg - which I questioned at first, but ended up loving a lot. Portions initially appeared small, but ended up successfully filling me up after a day spent snacking. The hot broth was also a perfect way to combat the twenty degree weather.
Kevin L.}New York, NY}5}196}0}-1}3}1/20/2018}The food and service were good, although the wait was over 2 hours for a party of 2. The serving sizes are a bit on the modest size, so if you're hungry, you might want to go to another hot pot place (like one of the all-you-can-eat ones) or else you'll end up spending $70/person ordering more food like we did.
Yvette Y.}Atlanta, GA}34}57}2}-1}4}1/19/2018}It's good Japanese hotpot. I had sukiyaki with prime beef rib eye. Everything tasted good. Service was good. If you have a party of 4+ people, make a reservation in advance. They do get busy soon after they open.
Su L.}Manhattan, NY}79}121}437}18}4}1/17/2018}Came here on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm. We were told it would be around a 35 minute wait, so we put our name down and went to sit on the bench outside. It was fairly cold, and the partition didn't provide much warmth, but it was okay. The wait was around 35 minutes like they said. We were seated at a booth, and didn't take very long to order. We ordered the sukiyaki, with pork and beef. Not long after ordering, we were brought hot towels. The server cooked everything for us. I've had sukiyaki many times before, and enjoyed dining at Shabu Tatsu. However, it's hard to go wrong with a pot dish like sukiyaki. They also offer free ice cream at the end, which is nice. All in all, had a good meal, and will return.
Cindy W.}Manhattan, NY}31}107}322}18}5}1/16/2018}This place has the most delicious sukiyaki, but the wait here is so long if you don't get here immediatelywhen they open. They don't take reservations for parties less than 4. Sukiyaki is just boiled meat/veggie/starches in a soy sauce based broth. They start by oiling the pot with skme beef fat and grilling your onions. Then you add your tofu and napa cabbage and thinly-sliced, high quality meat, and add other fixings. One plus Shabu-Tatsu is its wide, flat noodle, that not every place serves. It's one of the best parts. You do cook some of the food yourself, and you dip it into an egg mixture and pair it with your rice.Love that they give one scoop of ice cream at the end. It's just the perfect amount of sweet to finish off your meal.The pork kakuni was so tender and definitely the best appetizer. The meat was so soft, without being overwhelming in fat, and the taste was just perfect. Highly recommended!
Maggie L.}New York, NY}280}72}153}-1}5}1/15/2018}I'd say this is a great place to go when NYC's hectic weather drops below LIVING point because the hot sukiyaki will warm you up and make you feel alive again. Except the wait might be a little long... is it worth waiting for? Hm idk I only waited like an hour man (that was sarcasm btw). I'd opt for sukiyaki over shabushabu because it is way more flavorful. The ingredients are actually fairly simple with quality meat, but the special sauce is seriously like crack. Did I mention it was also a great excuse for me to eat more rice? It's a place you go to when you crave something wholesome and hearty -- like a hug, but for your tummy. Talking about tummies, I left this place looking like I was three months pregnant because I was so full. The price may seem a bit high, but you do get plenty of food, plus the salad and ice cream.
Sophia Yifan W.}Manhattan, NY}44}29}50}-1}5}1/14/2018}The hot pot here is quite good, you can feel that the meats are fresh and the taste is fine though I am not so into one of the sauce, but my friend likes it a lot. We ordered Shabushabu and another one with sauce directly in the soup. Both are recommend, but the amount is not that large for lunch menu.
Ellen Z.}New York, NY}0}10}0}-1}3}12/28/2017}Went with a good friend in town on a cold winter day. We were craving soup and meat! We ordered two prime rib eye in Shabu hotpot, beef tongue, and a side order of enoki mushrooms, and two bottles of hot sake. Beef was tender and sake warmed us up. The broth and other ingredients were underwhelming, however, and nothing else was interesting. Compared to some other hot pot places in Chinatown or Flushing, this place didn't impress and the bill came down to $130. The service was good and the free salad and ice-cream was descent, but it was too expensive for a forgettable experience.
Sho L.}Beverly, MA}1}2}0}-1}2}12/14/2017}It's unfortunate that they serve such amazing food, yet the service is so poor. Last thing you want after having a great meal is to be told "we won't seat you next time if you take too long to order".. Also I was not expecting this place to be a loud hangout spot for kids.
Liz S.}New York, NY}636}530}1003}18}3}12/4/2017}I came here with my boyfriend's family for a Sunday lunch-- whenever they come into the city, we usually do some kind of DIY-ish feast like hot pot or crawfish, so this fit the bill. We were lucky that there was a table available when we walked in a bit before one.On weekend lunches, your choices are relatively slim, with different shabu shabu and BBQ selections in the mid $20s. To further constrain this, most of these are minimum 2 orders. There are also some $6 appetizers.We had duck and fried teriyaki tofu to whet our appetites. Both were tiny but good. We also had the soup and salad that came with our combos, which were fine.Our prime shabu shabu (x2) took a while to get started, as they were having technical issues with the burner. They didn't give us any instructions so we just kind of went at it and treated it like normal Chinese hotpot. Meat was good but not as amazing as I would have hoped from doing the upgrade. Good quantity.We were a bit more enthusiastic about the yakiniku and seafood BBQ course. Again, no instruction, but we knew what to do here. The salmon in foil was OK; we liked the shrimp and calamari better. Meat was decent, again. Fun for a group activity.Ended the meal with green tea and red bean ice cream, which was too icy.Overall, I wasn't blown away by Shabu Tatsu given the price. 4 orders was enough for 5 people, but I wouldn't say we were stuffed. The whole experience took about an hour and a half. Service was fast enough but uncommunicative. If you're dead set on a shabu shabu experience, you won't be too let down, but it's not something I would tell others to come out of their way for.
Jen W.}Williamsburg Brooklyn, NY}15}7}22}-1}1}11/27/2017}I tried to make an early dinner reservation for my birthday and was told that the earliest reservation was for 6:30pm. I booked that time and a few days before my birthday, I got a phone call saying that another party had booked the same table for 5:30pm so they would need to cancel my reservation. I have no idea what happened here!  I loved this place in the past, I will not be dining here again.
Sherry Z.}Manhattan, NY}247}77}73}18}4}11/19/2017Updatedreview}Fine, I came back despite saying that I wouldn't wait again. Sue me. The fact of the matter is - it's hard to get great quality sukiyaki when you have a hankering for it. I also tried to find an alternative, but between Momokawa and Shabu-Tatsu, I think this place is easier to get to, tastier, and more affordable. We got the sukiyaki again and it was just as I remembered - very fresh ingredients, well prepared, and the service was still pretty good. We got a side this time instead of an appetizer, and oh man, the Mochi Kinchaku was such a great addition to our meal. It is this sticky rice cake wrapped in tofu curd and cooked really well in the sukiyaki sauce. Definitely the highlight of my meal and I want to eat it again already. And actually, it's not as expensive as I remembered since the sukiyaki set includes a small salad; the meat, vegetable, rice, and noodles for the sukiyaki itself; and an ice cream at the end. That's not so bad for a really satisfying meal!But, again, I had to wait over an hour for a table despite the fact that we arrived before 5:30PM. Who eats dinner before 5:30PM?! And the wait always feels unusually painful here because it's always pretty crowded in front of the restaurant and there are so many great alternative restaurants in the East Village that require less of a wait. I will most likely come back again, but hopefully with a reservation so I can get over the mental block about waiting for my food.
Kenny L.}Brooklyn, NY}0}2}1}-1}2}11/14/2017}It depends on who is serving you...I went here last Thursday and ordered 2x prime rib eye sukiyaki. The waitress who cooked our food was fantastic - she was very kind, described the food and methods to enjoy the meal, and most importantly, cooked the food perfectly. We were very satisfied with the meal and the experience as a whole.So we decided to come back. If only we didn't...how I regret coming back.We ordered 2x prime rib eye sukiyaki again with an additional serving of prime rib eye. However, our server was different from last time. Instead of the waitress we had last week, we had a young man. Now of course, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that anyone working here should have the experience in cooking sukiyaki...until I saw him ruin the first serving of prime rib eye. He didn't seem to know what he was doing...he turned on the fire too high and left us with dry rib eye. He seemed to be in a rush to get us out by pouring all the food in to be cooked instead of portioning it out. It got to the point where we told him to stop assisting us and decided to cook it ourselves using what we remembered from the excellent waitress. The meal came down to $96 and it was a total letdown. Total waste of money. Beware of the young man if you are eating sukiyaki. He'll ruin your meat.Although the first time was great, Never again for me.
Payal P.}Trenton, NJ}67}17}22}-1}4}11/12/2017}I went here for the first time on a date and had no idea what Hot Pot was. The waiter was really helpful and showed us how long to put each item in the boiling water for. He also told us how to eat each item for the best taste.Before and after our meals, they gave us a hot towel to clean our hands. We ordered Shabu -Shabu with chicken and shrimp. There was also vegetables, noodles, dipping sauce, and rice that  came with the dish. For dessert, we got chocolate and green tea ice cream. They also gave us hot green tea to drink after our meal.In the middle of the table is a boiling pot of water where you put vegetables and meats in. Cook your food yourself! And eat it hot!Overall, the food was delicious!! Would go back again. Great experience trying something new!!
Jessica Y.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}4}2}-1}3}10/31/2017}I went shabu-tatsu Thursday night. I should wait 20 minutes to have a basement seating. There was very strong garbage smell. It was too intense to disturb eating. However, the sukiyaki was not bad and the waiter was so kind. The matcha ice cream , which was served after finishing meal, was amazing.
Deniece M.}New York, NY}77}30}9}-1}4}10/28/2017}Authentic sukiyaki! We ordered the prime rib eye beef and it came with veggies, rice, and ice cream. Everything was delicious. Great service. The place is small though, so the wait time was between 1.5-2hrs on the saturday night we (a group of 3) went. They do take reservations though
Ashley Y.}Bensalem, PA}52}127}319}18}4}10/15/2017}Wow. This Yakiniku is a must try experience. It's not your typical hotpot/shabu shabu. It's worth a visit but the wait is super long, we waited exactly over one hour-ish to be seated. Once we got seated we ordered right away. For starters, we got assorted mushrooms and raw calf liver. Then, we ordered 2 meat platter (prime ribeye) which comes with a side of salad, rice, raw egg, veggies, and ice cream. The raw egg is for you to dip your meat in. It sounds gross and not clean but it's actually really good! Plus, it cools off your meat so you don't burn your mouth. Also, a side of Waygu beef which was really good and melts in your mouth. We were satisfied with everything and our bellies were full. The only down side is the long wait for our table.
Wendy F.}Brooklyn, NY}92}83}1170}18}4}10/15/2017}First time trying Japanese BBQ and Shabu-Shabu and, although everything was fresh, clean, and tasty, the portions were much smaller than I'm used to getting from the all-you-can-eat Chinese versions of the same. Our party of six ladies ordered two Yakiniku BBQ, two Shabu-Shabu, an additional order of Prime Ribeye Beef, and appetizers. The meal sets came with soups, salads, various vegetable dishes called "namul", rice, and ice cream desserts. I think we could have used an extra order of either the BBQ or Shabu, and we all would have walked out with full and satisfied bellies, but as it stood, we all had room for extra food. Had we ordered the extra meal set, the total meal would have been twice what we normally pay at the all-you-can-eat places.However, this is definitely where quality over quantity come into play. The cuts of meat are fresher, better quality, and have less fat than what you'd get at the all-you-can-eat places. Everything seems to be done with a bit more refinement, and the service is more apparent here. Overall, I'd revisit Shabu-Tatsu, but knowing what I know now, I would order more...
Vic C.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}82}0}-1}3}10/14/2017}Came here a few times. Nothing special. Another shabu shabu shabu place. Good service though.
Yukari E.}New York, NY}4}20}26}-1}5}10/8/2017}My go-to Shabu Shabu restaurant in East Village. I usually go there with my Shabu Shabu lover friends at 11:00 PM ish. Why? Coz you can't get in around 9:30, let alone sooner. Always had a good time and very close to Japanese style service including hot hand towel and Japanese dry beer. Thin sliced and tender beef with lots of veggies, then finishing up with Udon( Japanese noodle ). Can't wait feeling super cold outside and pinkish cheeky inside steam of hot pot!!
Chris P.}Los Angeles, CA}126}485}2344}18}4}10/3/2017}Great hot pot experience. I got the free range chicken ($30) and an oolong tea ($3), while my friends got the assorted seafood ($32), a sweet green tea ($4) and a beer ($7). While I'd done hot pot before, for the two friends I went with, it was their first time. They ended up really loving it, and I did too, so I think that says a good amount about the quality. The service was friendly and the restaurant itself is pretty small, but big enough to go with a group of 6 people at most. Just a small note, the drinks are small and there are no free refills (I'm talking about non-alcoholic drinks like my unsweetened tea). $3 for a plain unsweetened oolong iced tea with no refills, I thought that was pretty cheap of the restaurant.
Nessa S.}Jacksonville, FL}66}8}10}-1}4}10/2/2017}I haven't gone in years but absolutely wish they had locations in my current state. I most certainly will go back the next time I visit NYC. Just a really wonderful place for HOT POT! Best in New York!
Shih-Yun H.}Cambridge, MA}309}1}0}-1}5}9/17/2017}Most legit Japanese hotpot/yakiniku place I've been to in the states. Highly recommended.
Aoshi L.}Jersey City, NJ}4}126}0}-1}3}9/10/2017}This is the second and last time that I try shabu tatsu. Apparently, the food is supposed to reveal the ingredient's original flavor.  (by basically just cook in plain water) But I just don't find it to be any pleasing ... Whatever sauce combination I tried, I still feel the meat tastes a bit sour. If you are a shabu fans, ignore me. If you are like me, then probably you are just not the designed target for shabu style food.
Michael C.}New York, NY}240}152}121}18}4}9/4/2017}I actually thought this place was a bit on the pricey end for what you get, but it is very high quality. If you like hot pot, I would definitely recommend trying Shabu-Tatsu. The restaurant itself is very small and doesn't have a waiting area (they have a designated bench outside) so if you're coming on a busy night, you should definitely make a reservation beforehand. Even with a reservation, we still had wait about 20 minutes to get in.They offer 4 types of hot pots. The four of us split a chicken and duck hot pot. We definitely could have eaten more but we were planning on going somewhere else after. Everything about the meal was very high quality. The meat was tender and clean, the broth was uniquely flavored, and the noodles were a great texture. This restaurant does a great job at making a simple meal delicious. We also got hot sake, but in retrospect, we should have gotten an entire bottle.Will definitely come back here next time I'm in East Village.
Grace K.}Randolph, NJ}443}12}9}-1}4}8/31/2017}The quality of food here is definitely top notch in comparison to other hot pot restaurants.There is a ground floor and a basement floor at this restaurant. There is usually a wait as you can't make a reservation, so don't expect to be seated immediately. This Japanese hot pot is not all you can eat, but you won't be left feeling hungry. It is a bit pricier in comparison to some other places, but I think the quality is justified. The ingredients are always fresh and the service is great.
Shirley Y.}New York, NY}11}18}51}-1}3}8/28/2017}The food is great. A little overpriced but still acceptable. For appetizers, I like the beef tartar and eel tamago best. They are really delicious and highly recommended.However, I am so disappointed with the reservation. We have a big party of 9 and know it would be hard to find a restaurant to hold us, especially for a Japanese restaurant. So we called to make a reservation. When my friend called, she emphasized we have 9 people which is a big party. But the person who answered the call set the time for us. When we arrived, they said they took down a party of 5 from the call! How could they mess up 9 with 5! They even do not soind alike! Then we have to wait for 50min for the largest table or they would split us into two tables! By the way,this place is not suitable for big group. I cannot reach the dishes at the other side of the table. Nabe was in front of me. It tasted good. I tried some shabu shabu but not much as it is too far from me. They should let us know they cannot hold 9 people in the first place! I still don't understand why a 9 sounds like 5!
Kim C.}Charlotte, NC}0}2}0}-1}1}7/29/2017}Didn't even get to eat here but was really disappointed in their service. We had put our name on the list and they told us the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour, which we were fine with. We had also told them in advance that we had a baby with a stroller, but nothing was said regarding the fact. When they called us back to tell us that our table was ready, again we told them that we had a baby who was asleep in his stroller and the person said that it should be okay as long as we carry the stroller down the stairs. We were about 5 minutes away and when we walked there, the hostess told us that we couldn't bring the stroller downstairs. When we asked to speak to a manager about accommodating our request, the hostess seemed as though she didn't even care. While I know that NYC restaurants are not exactly the most spacious, it was just frustrating to have to wait almost an hour for them to just deny us service. They could've told us from the beginning that we couldn't have a baby stroller in their restaurant. We also asked how long the wait for the upstairs tables were (because she told us we could keep the stroller upstairs at the table). She then told us it would be about 35 minutes if we wanted to wait. We were fine with that and asked for a cup of water and she said no, so we just left. Like I stated before, I completely understand that these restaurants are small and don't have much room for accommodating a stroller, but it was more so the fact that we had told them ahead of time our situation and they had no issue with it -- thus making us wait an hour only to be denied service.
David M.}Manhattan, New York, NY}1}3}3}-1}5}7/26/2017}Great food! Got the pork and prime ribeye shabu shabu. Got lucky didnt have to wait since we were seated in the basement, nice and quiet
J R.}New York, NY}5}27}0}-1}5}7/25/2017}I love this place it can do no wrong only downside is you can't just walk in bc it's always packed make a reservation and eat big
Julia G.}Houston, TX}72}23}593}-1}5}7/24/2017}Love both the shabu shabu and sukiyaki at this place! Perhaps the broth and sauce itself are pretty standard and consistent. However, that is okay because of the good quality of A5 Miyazaki beef that completely melts in your mouth. The servers are also all very nice and helpful in ensuring that your food doesn't overcook like in a lot of other hot pot places.
Ken W.}ELMHURST, NY}2}8}0}-1}4}7/15/2017}Been there a few times over the years and their food is always fresh for BBQ. Most of the time it was for dinner and the line to have a seat is simply too long. Going there early enough is really key to not having to wait outside other than to make a reservation.I also tried lunch. Same great quality though there are only about 10 items to choose from.
Huijun Z.}New York, NY}80}1}0}-1}1}7/10/2017}Got horrible service and waiter is very rude. I don't really mind he forgetting our appetizers and ignored all our minor request on food and cooking. He wore an angry face all the time and very impatient. We had five people and he gave us only 4 rice wanna let us pay for the other one. But later he gave us more rice as we didn't ask and didn't mention them are free or not. When we had the check I realized there was extra rice charge. I just wanna make sure how it comes cuz it's only $3 (we total like $100) Then he became very aggressive and asked rudely if we had been to restaurants before. Also he said it's all our PROBLEM and blame us don't understand the service. I was shocked and felt be offended a lot. I would never go to this place again and if you are considering going, I only wish you good luck
Chitat N.}East Lansing, MI}0}1}0}-1}4}7/7/2017}Service is good, but nothing special about the shabu. Maybe I order the wrong food Idk....
Michael C.}Manhattan, NY}74}926}236}18}3}5/30/2017}I dunno, I just think there are better shabu shabu places in the world now. I think this place might have been one of the founders of the movement, but hot pot can be more flavorful. Don't get me wrong, Shabu-Tatsu East Village isn't bad, but have other places I'd recommend for your meat/protein in boiling liquids needs. The per table minimum order is also kind of weird, feels dated, just like this restaurant.
Latoya C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}5/10/2017}I wish I could give this place zero or minus stars. Our shabu shabu place (Shabu shabu 70) closed down after many years recently closed and we were in search of a new place. It was a lovely family run place. They paid attention to detail and we very welcoming to everyone. Let's start from the beginning. The place is cute and innovative with the pot built in to the table. This is a con as well because it makes seating limited. They have max of 8 tables. They only take reservations for 4 or more but lucky you they take walk ins (sarcasm). You take 30 mins parking to arrive to a ride hostess that acts like she owns the place (miss if no one comes in here you don't get paid and you are out of a job - stop the foolery). She then tells you that there's an hour and a half wait and we are free to go to the bar next door which has the same owner. The bar next door is a sake bar. It's quaint and the staff are delightful. You finally get called. If your entire party isn't there you don't get seated (however the hostess makes exceptions for certain people). I've witnessed this with my very own eyes and eyes. Then she tried to feed me some ridiculous story that was an obvious lie. Then you're finally seated and they rush you to order. After your food arrives they disappear when you need them. They reappear to clear your table without consent. Bottom line. The food is underwhelming for the hype they create around this place. Have a look at the bar next door and skip the restaurant.
Renee R.}New York, NY}1055}119}555}18}4}5/5/2017}Hella good food. Long a$$ wait! Errythang is really good. Kinna pricey, but worth it.Love, Renee from the Bay
Stephanie W.}Flushing, NY}32}20}10}-1}5}4/1/2017}There's always a wait but it's definitely worth it! My boyfriend and i always get the sukiyaki for 2 and we are always full and happy when we finish the meal. It doesn't seem like a lot of food, but it fills you up! The meat quality is pretty good ass well. I would suggest to cook the meat medium rare and dip into the bowl of scrambled raw egg! That's the best way to eat the beef because it's not too dry and is nice and tender that way. We come often because its so yummy here.
Bennett C.}Brooklyn, NY}91}45}0}-1}4}3/27/2017}Solid shabu shabu in the EV. Usually pretty busy so come early or make a reservation.
Jenny J.}New York, NY}65}98}201}18}5}3/24/2017}My friends and I wanted to go to Hi-Collar but oops it's a bar at night!So we opted for Shabu-Tatsu next door at 6:45 pm. No wait but we had to sit in the basement. With Hot Pot, Sukiyaki, and JBBQ options, we chose Sukiyaki as we've never experienced that style before. Sukiyaki is basically stir fry, with a "special sauce," which the waitress compared to teriyaki. Prices depend on the kind of meat. My two friends chose prime rib eye ($29) and I chose rib eye ($27). Funnily, they all go in the skillet and they're indistinguishable by look and taste, so I think my friends learned their lesson haha. The price includes the meat, LOTS of vegetables, "raw egg" if we want, which was apparently for...dipping and did not fare well (it makes the meat slimier, not sure what else one can expect), and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. Ice cream flavors offered are green tea, red bean, vanilla and chocolate. We tried the first two; they were natural tasting and great. We were there for 2 hours and didn't feel rushed at all! Our waitress was sweet, though she didn't speak English too well. My favorite part of the experience was the toilet on the ground floor. It's a Toto washlet! That's the Japanese toilet with a heated toilet seat, water jets, etc. It was pleasant and fun, though my friend was weirded out just by my description of it...
Jamie K.}Brookline, MA}529}73}35}18}3}3/6/2017}Went here for lunch on a Saturday. I was expecting a little more flavor to the broth (disclaimer: I'm a hot pot person, not a shabu person). The meal starts out with a typical salad. Then they uncover the mysterious pot to revealing boiling water with a piece of dashima floating around. We threw in all of the meats and veggies and then the noodles. It was all pretty average.Nice interior. Service was pretty good. Attentive waiters and short wait for a table. Overall the food was pretty decent with good quality ingredients. I just didn't find myself thinking, "I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in New York!"
Steven C.}West Dennis, MA}139}492}28}18}4}3/3/2017}Great decor in this east village find. My youngest had never had Shabu Shabu and we stopped in after a full day of tourist type activities.Great cuts of Rib Eye, fresh veggies and great service.   Anyway, come here.  My only reference was Tokyo and this was an identical experience.  Bravo
Yicheng W.}The Waterfront, Jersey City, NJ}154}7}1}-1}4}2/28/2017}One of the best Sukiyaki hot pot place in NYC. Fresh meat with the raw egg dipping sauce is amazing. The waiting line could be various based on the day of the week. Could be a bummer if the line is surprising long. They have desks under the street level which does not provide barbecue equipment.
Diana R.}Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA}60}13}5}-1}1}2/23/2017}This place is horrible on service there was a 1.5 hour wait!!!! So we waited and after 2 hours people kept getting seated I asked 3 times they said reservations first even though we've been waiting 2 hours she said yes. When we finally got seated we ordered shabu shabu everything looked promising except for the soup was flavorless. Yes flavorless soup absolutely no seasoning on anything.. not even salt, when I asked for at least some salt they looked at me confused. I let the waiter know he said this is how we serve our food. We paid $75 for flavorless food!!! I'm still hungry. If you want water with meat at a really high price go here. The reviews don't reflect their service or food. Very dissatisfied.
Trevor L.}Brooklyn, NY}2}60}69}-1}1}2/23/2017Updatedreview}I usually am the biggest fan of this place. My wife and I come several times a month and have been for years. Today I walked in at 5:15pm, just after they open so the place is dead empty,  I tried to get shabu shabu by myself since my wife was out tonight and they point to the 2 person minimum. Now I've seen this on the menu before and completely understand that they need to maintain a certain revenue per table. But again the place was completely empty! I spoke with the manager, who's always been extremely nice and helpful every time I've been there in the past, and he said they won't do it unless I order the super expensive wagyu beef option. This was a bit surprising since I'd be out of the restaurant before they even seat their next customer but I guess that's how they treat regulars. Needless to say I walked away to go to another one of my favorites in the hood, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be back.
Terry S.}New York, NY}484}20}25}-1}5}2/11/2017}Summer or winter, I love coming to this place for the sukiyaki and shabu. Both of these offer delicious premium quality meat and an assortment of veggies. Although the shabu base is just hot water, the sesame and ponzu sauces are the key to giving the meats and veggies flavor. The sukiyaki is similar to a sweet soy sauce base and it gets sweeter throughout the meal so water is provided to lessen the sweetness. But trust me, it's delish. The raw egg + sukiyaki beef + rice = PURE YUMMY.  ^_^ Best of all, 3 ice cream flavors are provided at the end and who doesn't love ice cream? love love love this place.
Dave K.}San Francisco, CA}0}105}98}-1}4}2/8/2017}I love Shabu Shabu. This place is delicious. Food service 5 star. I wish they had a full bar.The place is a little quiet but the food is awesome.
Sherry Z.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}208}124}360}-1}4}1/26/2017}Came here for the sukiyaki hot pot. Delicious base soup. You order by person. It's about $27-$29 per person. It come with meat, assorted vegetables, and ice cream. Very filling. If you want more, can order extra stuff.Also tried the umaki for appetizer. It's basically eel wrapped in egg. Surprisingly tasty and loved the smooth texture.
Silvino P.}Manhattan, NY}365}121}732}18}4}1/11/2017}We always have shabu shabu when we come here which is pretty good compared to Japanese shabu shabu, only thing is it's pretty expensive..I think for one person it's about $28.00 each so expect to pay at least that much. All in all pretty good place to eat if you're hungry and when it's cold only problem was one waitress(late 30's Japanese) is a little rude and always has been when I go there. Everyone else is pleasantly nice minus the one waitress which is odd because she's Japanese
Ruiqi Z.}Stamford, CT}53}4}10}-1}4}1/6/2017}Waited about one and half hour and turns out it deserve it! I like water as soup at the beginning which keep the flavor of beef! Love it!
Amy K.}New York, NY}3}2}0}-1}5}12/23/2016}If you are looking for great Japanese shabu shabu, with awesome service and an incredible deal, this is the place. I was raised in Tokyo, and grew up eating shabu-shabu for all special events. While this can never be as good as home, it is still the best place in NYC. All those other reviews complaining that the broth isn't flavored are clearly unfamiliar that there are different types of hot pot. Shabu-shabu is Japanese hot pot and is meant to be simply meat and veggies boiled in hot water seasoned with kelp and then dipped into provided sauces sauces. Don't come here expecting Chinese hot pot. It's a Japanese restaurant. It does get crowded, so come with friends and make a reservation!
Serena Y.}Los Angeles, CA}0}1}1}-1}2}12/22/2016}I don't know why this place is so popular. Foods are ok but service is hummm... i can't say it's ok Even though they require 15% tips
D C.}New York, NY}0}46}0}-1}5}12/16/2016}We always get the shabu with the premium beef.  The beef is always amazing and the enoki, hakusai and noodles are always delicious.  Also, excellent service and sake selection.
Cindy C.}Elmhurst, NY}9}1}1}-1}3}12/9/2016}I think this restaurant is overrated and pricy. Portion was really really tiny and soup is not soup, I would rather call it Water. Definitely not worth the price.
Tick...tick...tock...Clock C.}Santa Monica, CA}10}511}42}-1}3}12/6/2016}The Bibimbap is the best I've ever had...Shudder-better than my moms...I had the mushroom one and it was so good I was sad to see the bottom of my bowl. The shabu was not as impressive...not even close. There was zero flavour in the soup-you could put all of the seasoning of green onion and the paste you wanted it still tasted like water. So that was the part I was totally unimpressed with. I didn't like the minimum order thing either we were 2 people and we barely finished out meal it seemed like such a waste coming with a big party is better. So I wouldn't come in by yourself unless you haven't eaten in days. The service was unbelievable. Our waiter was so super attentive and so nice.
R C.}New York, NY}1}108}107}-1}5}11/30/2016}I have always loved this place! I go back all the time for their sukiyaki. It's a small place so I always recommend calling for reservations because if not, you can be waiting an awfully long time for a table especially during the winter. Food is good, great quality meat, everything is fresh and great service! You can't ask for anything more. At the end, you get ice cream with your meal. I've been going here for years and it has not disappointed in any way.
Tina W.}New York, NY}421}905}1193}18}4}11/19/2016}Location: at east village, next to Hi-collar. Shabu tatsu is a great place for some Japanese Hotpot. It would be better to reserve your seat if you have a party of more than 4. They have limited 10min-grace waiting time as well as 2 hour dining -in time limit. Food: we had sepcial nabe for 2 and sukiyaki for 3. Everything is fabulous! I mean, you can taste the high quality of prime rib-eye and duck and seafood!!And they have free ice cream at the end.Price: everything has a min order of 2 so come here with friends.Service: service can be rude since they are trying to get as many customer as possible.overall: good, pleasant place for winter harbination.
Rita L.}Manhattan, NY}1497}521}5346}18}3}11/18/2016}Came here with different groups of friends a few times. Not impressed by their hot pot. There's no flavor in the soup. The hot pot is charged per person, with a minimum of 2 people per order. I recommend getting one pot for 2 and then order something else. I looked at other tables that ordered for more people and it looks like they'll just give you more meat, everything else is the same. I also got a beef bibimbap to share with the table. It was pretty good. Red bean ice cream was also good to end the meal. I think this place is overrated and not worth the price.
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}3}11/6/2016}Review only for the sukiyaki and the bibimbap - I'll have to try the BBQ and shabu shabu another time. Yes, the minimum order restrictions are annoying. Yes, the minimum amount you need to pay is annoying. Yes, this place does not take solo diners unless you have a pretty big appetite and can down one order of prime rib by yourself. Yes, it's basically fondue for people who don't/can't eat huge quantities of cheese. However, the service was just really friendly. Always smiling, always patient, even when a really rude customer all but snapped her fingers and went, "I said salt. This is pepper. I want SALT." Our table of five had four orders of sukiyaki, yet our waiter ended up giving everyone the ice cream dessert. I was feeling like a Christmas ham coming apart at my seams after three straight days of eating out, so I opted for ordering my own veggie/tofu bibimbap and eating bits and pieces out of my friends' sukiyaki. They gave a ton of vegetables instead of your standard white cabbage and carrots - the platter also included watercress, mushrooms, and two different kinds of noodles. I didn't try any of the meat but I did find the broth very tasty - some kind of soy sauce mix. I feel kind of silly for admitting that the red bean ice cream was my favorite part of the meal. I ate the tiny scoop in three bites, maximum. Still, is it worth almost $30-35 (plus tip and tax) to essentially cook your meal yourself? Everything was tasty and in very large portions, though.
Jacques R.}New York, NY}398}110}58}-1}4}11/6/2016}Real deal Shabu concept with a myriad of sukiyaki choices.If you're not familiar with Shabu, it is basically the principle of Korean BBQ, with grill and fondue with a broth base under a flame. You get served different kinds of meat/seafood and you soak and cook them to your liking at the center of a table big heated soup casserole. The clean  flavors and ingredients are the real thing.The ambiance and decor are traditional Japanese ,  sober and minimalist, which gives an authentic feel.Good selection of Japanese beers / sakes to pair with your meal.Also they have the most hightech toilets seats in their washrooms, which add an extra reason to visit this restaurant. .
Feng Y.}New York, NY}42}3}0}-1}5}11/6/2016}So deeeeeelicious !!!!! We ordered sukiyaki for lunch. Yes, they have lunch special menu! You could order sukiyaki meal for a single person! This meal conclude a sukiyaki pot( pre cooked), rice, egg drop soup, a combo sider.
Kian M.}Costa Mesa, CA}250}66}12}-1}5}10/30/2016}First time and a great experience, very cozy spot. Great shabu shabu with quality meat and vegetables. Their sesame sauce is one of the best I've had and the green tea and ice cream at the end of the meal was amazing. Will definitely come back.
Jon P.}Manhattan, NY}192}104}53}18}5}10/30/2016}Great weekend lunch special from 12-3...$24 for prime shabu shabu with meat, salad, rice, and ice cream. We got the vegi gyoza and roasted duck which were delicious as well.
Kim C.}Brooklyn, NY}165}83}58}-1}5}10/28/2016}This is such a delicious and fun place! Be warned that it's no hidden gem and you should be prepared to wait 45-90 minutes any night of the week unless you go before 6pm and they don't take reservations. That being said--it's worth it! I've waited many a freezing night for a warm shabu shabu meal, accompanied with a refreshing salad. Highly recommended!
Carolyn C.}Queens, NY}4}5}0}-1}2}10/20/2016}The shabu shabu was fresh but bland and skimpy, not satisfying and not worth the price.  At least we finished the meal off well with a nice green tea ice cream.
Shay L.}New York, NY}0}98}0}-1}4}10/17/2016}Let's get to the point. If you REALLY love meat (and I mean really love) then you'll absolutely find this place delicious. If you're looking for a well-rounded hotpot restaurant with tasty vegetables, savory broth, etc... THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. I'm giving 4 stars based on the Prime Rib Shabu which was amazing.. but everything else lacked luster, including the service. Our waiter looked like he was absolutely miserable and for overpriced hotpot, I was looking for more of an experience. Broth is literally just water with two thick chunks of seaweed... not science there. Vegetable plate was on the small side for 2 people. Overall, just meh (but again, unless you really LOVE meat).
Shaji K.}Queens, NY}262}1359}1193}18}4}9/26/2016}One of the few places that serves Sukiyaki at a decent price in Manhattan. Early Saturday afternoon and easily able to get a table for four.While the BBQ and Shabu-Shabu looked interesting, had to get the Sukiyaki ($17). Lunch special gives you soup, salad, apps, and rice with your meal. Soup/salad is your basic fare, a little something to get the appetite going. Main dish is served on a cast iron pot with flavorful broth and plenty of meat. The accompanying appetizers are good - seaweed, some veggie rolls, and greens. They also give you a raw egg for dipping purposes; used it to coat the rice before putting into the broth. Meat is tender and soaks up the broth well, with the egg rice it's a perfect bite. Extremely filling meal and you get your money's worth; only drawback is that the broth is on the sweet side, so add some hot sauce for a better balance. Also got a cold sake ($8) - which they overflow into a box proper Japanese style.Food here comes out fairly quickly and service is solid. Dinner menu seems to have a lot more options but the lunch menu has the better deal.
Amy P.}Manhattan, NY}28}11}5}-1}5}9/20/2016}Have been a loyal customer for 5 years now - this is my go to place for high quality shabu shabu. It would be unfair to come here expecting Chinese or Korean hotpot, as this is a shabu shabu restaurant - there isn't meant to be flavored broth so that you can enjoy the freshness of the meat and vegetables as they are. Get the prime rib eye meat! Can't go wrong, I have brought parents, friends, out of town visitors etc. and everyone has always loved it. One of my favorite places to eat in the city.
Dana G.}Manhattan, NY}0}13}2}-1}4}9/20/2016}A great Shabu Shabu spot. The restaurant is very small and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Their teriyaki tofu is one of the best things I've ever had, and their gyoza is extra crispy and flavorful
Alexia G.}New York, NY}83}68}11}-1}1}9/6/2016}Once a decent and a go-to Japanese hot pot place. Not anymore. Tiny tiny portion- shabu shabu meat is sliced paper thin that it breaks when you try to pick it up. Tons of restrictions- minimum orders of two on everything (except for appetizer), and they charge you extra $3 for grilling one order of bbq for you in the kitchen (no you can't grill it on the tablet ourself because there's a minimum order of two)!! Servers were not attentive or friendly. The whole dining experience was not enjoyable. Three girls left hungry. Don't waste your money here. Sad to say that I will not return again.
Suzie Y.}New York, NY}49}83}297}-1}5}8/21/2016}Our first visit to Shabu-Tatsu.  The place is very cute and casual environment.  We ordered two serving of prime rib-eye beef shabu with extra meat, sake, and beer.  =)  We were given hot towel to start.  Nice and hot. =)  They put the boiling pot with kelp or seaweed?  Not sure of the name.  Soon as the water started to boil they brought out the beef, veggies, noodles.  TBH I haven't gone to shabu shabu in ages so I wasn't sure what to put in first.  We asked the waiter and he was so generous to explain to us step by step.  As you cook the meat and veggies you get stuff floating on top.   This was the first time a restaurant had someone come by and clean all that out for you.  Meat was tender and veggies was so fresh.  Noodles were so good and yummy at the end with all that flavor that the soup came to be.  I was more than full at this point.  We were provided with an one scoop of ice-cream each at the end.  Such an awesome finish!  I will definitely recommend and come back.  Love the experience!
Yajing Z.}Philadelphia, PA}0}4}46}-1}4}7/27/2016}Good place! The prime beef sukiyaki is so yummy!Appetizer in the picture( forgot the name) is great!Service is good! Recommended!
Missy J.}Toronto, Canada}109}45}410}-1}2}7/26/2016}Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.- You left me smelling like grease.- You left me feeling like I've offended the servers.- You left me wondering if it was anything special, if it was worth it.- You left me broker.But you're in the neighborhood and you're convenient, so the jokes on me.
Sisi F.}Brooklyn, NY}48}27}60}-1}5}7/21/2016}Hmmmmm really enjoy the meat! Best meat i had for hot pot so far. But the portion is way too small and a bit over priced! I can eat two ppl portions.
Dirk H.}Irvine, CA}76}22}1}-1}2}7/19/2016}Nothing exceptional. Very expensive for the portions and nothing remarkable about the cuts of beef. I've never seen restaurants post purchase minimums in addition to "no substitution" so prominently. I'd say look else where for your shabu fix.
Vicky L.}New York, NY}3}43}25}-1}1}7/12/2016}There isn't many recent review for this place. One reason is probably because this is a very average place. It also has a very bad business model. They basically take your money now cause they don't care if you return. It was our first time here. Once we saw the menu we were hit with restriction (2 order for shabu shabu) and minimum (40 per table 25 per person). Whatever right? Because everything (entree) is over 25 on the menu anyways. So we ordered the shabu shabu one beef one pork to mix it up. Taste wise the soup was very bland. However when you dip the food with msg and soy sauce it tastes better. We also ordered enoki on the side. What hotpot/ shabu shabu establish doesn't serve enoki as a default side? They brought us maybe 3 oz of enoki. We finished the shabu shabu and had 1/4 a cup of ice cream. The bill came and we were charged 6 dollars for the enoki mushroom I bursted out in laughter. Keep in mind enoki is 1-2 dollars a pound at grocery stores and it said 5 dollars on the menu. Other reviews also mentioned shady billing practices. I'm not surprised and won't be returning.To conclude:FlavorlessRip offBring your own enoki mushrooms Go somewhere else
Elizabeth K.}Los Angeles, CA}20}22}5}-1}4}6/8/2016}My favorite shabu-shabu spot in NY!! The quality of meat is great and service is nice. I love how the broth tastes after all the vegetables and meat go in. They also give icecream at the end of your meal!
Dayan L.}Bronxville, NY}198}13}11}-1}3}6/6/2016}Overall, it's very ok food. We get BBQ meat. It was good, but the food was over priced. The salad was so gross in a plastic plate.
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}5/29/2016}Comfy ambiance and fresh ingredients. I was not 100% used to this Japanese style hotpot to start with - cooked with just boiling water! Chinese and Korean hot pots are all the hot pots that I had before. Both of them define a stronger flavored soup base. Chinese style would be spicy soup, or some meat/bone herbal soup, or veggie soup. Korean version, I always go with the spicy and thick soup based hot pots. So I was worried if the meal is going to be flavorless when we started. However, the dish did turn out to be flavorful thanks to the fresh ingredients! Started with meat then all kinds of veggies. The soup began to absorb and show flavor as we eating. Lastly, I also enjoyed the matcha ice cream. It's rich, milky and authentic.Def a healthy hot pot choice for fresh ingredients and quality meat.
Roberta A.}Brooklyn, NY}0}8}2}-1}5}5/29/2016}Great place. I had the weekend lunch menu (sadly my friends in NY are all vegan or vegetarian, no way to share a hot pot) and it was simply amazing. The sukiyaki was incredible, I loved it. The service was fine, they also apologized for the time I had to wait, but wasn't really that long. Also, I would have been glad to wait for such great food.
Ksenia F.}Queens, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}5/20/2016}Been here twice and the place is great. Food is delicious and the whole process of making your own soup is so much fun! You better call in advance to check the wait time for the table cuz the place is packed at dinner time.
Makhimba S.}Flatbush - Ditmas Park, NY}3}5}9}-1}1}5/13/2016}Worst restaurant I've ever been to! $32 for duck hot pot per person! They gave us five thin slices of duck and unflavored broth. So we basically paid for hot water. At the end we were given ice cream that tasted like cheap Hagen daaz. I've had good hot pot before and this is not it! I want my money back, do not eat here I know I won't be ever again. Oh and the ice cream had ice chunks! Gross
Lisa M.}Houston, TX}0}2}0}-1}5}5/9/2016}This is such a great place for an interactive dinner with friends.  Went with a group and none of us had experienced Shabu Shabu before.  Our waiter was incredibly patient and helpful, telling us how to go about the dinner.  The prime rib was excellent and overall had a great experience.
Lou K.}New York, NY}52}24}0}-1}3}5/7/2016}The experience of cooking your own thinly sliced prime ribeye, and drinking the broth it creates when it's all done, is something I didn't do before. And I didn't think I want to do very often, but I guess my frequent visit speaks louder.Although it seems pricey, but the idea of steak slices, rice noodles, soup, and then the green tea ice cream (all included), makes it a nice experience a couple of times a month.The staff is probably the reason I had to knock off a star of the rating. They don't smile often, and they seem to be offended whenever I ask for something. Maybe i was unlucky, but the food is good enough for me to focus on cooking my meal and ignore the "ocular pat-down".
Tracy C.}New York, NY}9}95}77}18}4}4/28/2016}I went here for the sukiyaki. We ordered the prime rib and ribeye. The soup base was delicious. The price was a little steep for few slices of beef and some vegetables. There is a minimum of two orders per table so I definitely won't come here for a solo dinner or lunch. It also came with rice and ice cream. The ice cream was pretty good. The staff was also very attentive.
Ario K.}Los Angeles, CA}113}14}7}-1}5}4/21/2016Updatedreview}The food here is awesome! We tried sukiyaki and it's really good, also the appetizer Umairoll is tasty too. Not to mention their green tea ice cream, the best I have ever have! Highly recommended to have dinner here :)
Michelle L.}Manhattan, NY}6}78}10}-1}4}4/20/2016}The ingredients were of good quality, and the service was superb - they kept coming over to skim the foam off of our broth and to refill our water.We went with the prime rib shabu shabu, and it was a good amount of meat, vegetables, and noodles. We all left comfortably full, and the ice cream at the end was cherry on top of a good meal!
Shanshan L.}Centereach, NY}64}4}4}-1}2}4/8/2016}For shabu, they just offer boiling water and beef and vegetables. With 45 dollar, you can have anything you want in any Chinese hot pot restaurant. And the choice of sauce, meat and vegetables are far better than this one. I can not even find a reason why they recommend this reassurance.
Kelly G.}Brooklyn, NY}15}208}162}-1}5}4/6/2016}Really impressed with our meal here. Thought it was a good price for all the freebies we got. The hot towels atThe beginning of the meal was such an elegant touch. It was so much fun to cook our meat in the pot..very romantic for date nights. The menu was a little hard to understand and there was a minimum spend. Come here if you are ready to chow down! Green tea ice cream was super yummy. Drink menu was underwhelming..
Mily K.}New York, NY}186}8}161}-1}2}4/6/2016}Recommend prime ribeye steak shabu shabu. The meat quality was nice, had to order extra. Staff was kind. but the broth was very poor. Just water and one piece of kelp. (Wtf) also tiny portion of vegetables.. Ugh... And the noodle and soup was terrible. -Meat, Souce , Green tea ice cream  -The rest
Wanting L.}Manhattan, NY}1}3}5}-1}5}3/28/2016}Normally I don't write reviews unless the food really impressed me. I'm a sukiyaki-lover but after I tried the shabushabu here, well it becomes one of my favors too! The environment is very cozy, the staff are friendly and professional and the ingredients are fresh. They also have free ice cream as dessert! Btw the ice cream is really delicious! Green tea flavor is a must try!!! Chocolate is also good! I love this restaurant and I hope you too. Gonna try their sukiyaki next time!
Haena Y.}New York, NY}239}75}122}-1}4}3/20/2016}I've tried both the Shabu Shabu and the sukiyaki. Both were delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. The broth of the sukiyaki was a bit on the sweeter side so beware. The only thing is that once you're near done, the restaurant rushes you out. On my second visit, I still had some ice cream left and they still rushed us to pay bc there was a wait. As a customer, I didn't enjoy that experience on both occasions. However they're solid with their food!
Nicole K.}New York, NY}0}135}4}-1}2}3/18/2016}I recalled having a delicious dinner here years ago and wanted to relive it.  Wrong choice.  I called to make a reservation.  Okay, so you can't make a reservation.  I hauled myself to their restaurant only to be told that there would be about a one hour wait. Okaaay.  We headed over to Snowdays across the street to kill some time and check out the shave ice (go there, it's unique!).  So we ate shave ice for about an hour (!!).  We pop into Shabu Tatsu, as they took down my number but never called me.  "We called you like 10 minutes ago."  Nope, stop lying.  I showed them my phone.  They sheepishly replied that they may be having problems with their phone. Riiight.  So because I failed to pick up on this phantom call, I got push back in the waitlist.  I waited approximately another 30+ minutes to be seated with my guests, despite there being available seating beforehand.  Other people I was waiting with actually experienced the "but we called you and you didn't pick up line" too.  Service was okay and food was okay, and nowhere near as great as I recall.  And no, my review of the food is no affected by my wait time, etc.  It seriously was blah.  So don't waste your precious time here.
Nuri H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}13}8}-1}5}3/17/2016}Attentive service and fresh food. I visited on weekday 6pm, and there was no line. They made me wait until everyone is there. I guess this is common in any small Japanese restaurant. Just waited until my friend come. We chose sukiyaki option. Two order was minimum for sukiyaki. Love the food. My boyfriend really liked here and suggested to come back again.
Michelle L.}Stanford, CA}1}9}6}-1}4}3/15/2016}Although slightly pricey the food quality is superb. Three of us went and ordered the ribeye shabu shabu. Portions are on the smaller side so we ended up getting two extra orders of meat, but it was totally worth it.
Sasha J.}Harrison, NY}3}19}4}-1}5}3/12/2016}Love Shabu tastu! Had two prime rib eye dinners and everything was absolutely fresh and delicious. The waitress was very attentive and I am looking forward to going back!  Second time here and has never been disappointed.
Moso H.}New York, NY}0}154}0}-1}4}3/10/2016}This was my first time having shabu shabu, or any other form of hotpot dining - which is a little odd because I've eaten much weirder things - and the experience was a good one.  What got me interested in trying this was a book I was reading about Japanese cuisine, and this place is highly rated on Yelp.  It is a popular spot - people were lining up for the 5 pm opening.  The servers were helpful and the ingredients were good.  The concept is this: you sit at a table that has a stovetop burner built into it.  The staff bring you a pan of water and two plates - one of thinly-sliced meat and another with cabbage, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and veggies.  In front of you there are a few small bowls - two contain dipping sauces, one has rice in it, and another is to enjoy the broth.  You drop the food into the pan and let it cook, giving the vegetables more time than the meat.  A very engaging and active dining experience.  The fact that you are constantly playing with the food can cut into the conversation a little, but you probably won't mind.  I hope to try the sukiyaki on my next visit.
Amy Z.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}1}-1}4}3/5/2016}I have mixed feelings about Shabu-Tatsu east village, and it's essentially a 3.5 star for me.Shabu shabu and sukiyaki are both awesome here, if the sukiyaki we had was a bit too salty to my taste. Green tea ice cream is absolutely awesome. For $25 per person in New York City, it's a solid deal. However, we felt rushed by waiters. Apparently they had some guests waiting for our table, so we've presented our check as soon as we got the dessert menu, which was OK. Having a waiter standing not more than four steps from you the whole time you're eating the ice cream, however, was NOT okay. Should I also mention they were exchanging looks and frowning when my friend got up for the restroom? While I understand the anxiety, it's not our fault that you have guests waiting. I'm not going to finish the ice cream in five seconds just because of that.
Jenn T.}New York, NY}40}8}0}-1}4}2/27/2016}The most delicious hot pot restaurant in NYC. Its a tiny little place so the wait is always long but it is well worth it! Once you get in everything is amazing-the meat is fresh and sauces are yummy. The appetizers like the shumai and gyoza are also really good. Can't say enough about the food but the wait really sucks.
Yiwen Z.}Honolulu, HI}160}224}604}18}4}2/17/2016}dinner of sukiyaki~   two order of sukiyaki is plenty for two people, I would actually recommend getting just one order, and add someside dishes~   (but then you'll have to share one ice cream lol)food was decent (I mean it's kinda hard to mess up sukiyaki or shabushabu...)the waitress seem to be rushing people...  but we still took our time. green tea ice cream is pretty strong, red bean is nice and sweet~
Nikki L.}Manhattan, NY}204}1037}104}18}4}2/12/2016Updatedreview}I like the ginger miso dressing on the little salad they give you in the beginning - it has just the right tang and saltiness.I enjoyed my meal at Shabu-tastu much more this time since the special nabe broth was flavorful and much richer tasting. It reminded me of sukiyaki soup base with a slight sweetness to it but with more depth.The nabe included enoki mushroom, some vegetables, some glass noodles, carrot slices, tofu etc. The addition of a choice of seafood and duck meat made it even more enjoyable.The service was very nice.
Karen T.}New York, NY}35}64}0}-1}4}2/9/2016}This is our go to spot for a cozy and casual meal with friends. Never disappoints!  We love this spot for a cold evening.  Combo Sets are reasonably priced and the flavor is consistent.
Elsa G.}Manhattan, NY}95}140}47}-1}5}1/26/2016}We really Like this place not only for the food but for the good service and atmosphere.It was our first hot pot :)The menu contains not only the main menu but also an ice cream and a hot tea.We took the remaining food to go as it was too much for only the 2 of us :)To sunup a very good deal :)
Lynn B.}Barrington, IL}31}66}30}-1}5}1/11/2016}Two words: Prime Beef! I cannot emphise this enough. It's welll worth it. The broth was a little bland for my taste but the beef compensated for it. Perfect when .. oh baby it's cold outside! P.S. Check out their restroom. They have one of those Japanese bidet toilet seat to leave you fresh and clean!
Vince C.}Manhattan, NY}2}41}14}-1}1}1/9/2016}Worst. Service. Ever.Disclaimer: the other waiters were okay, but our main waitress was absolutely horrible - don't get bullied by the evil waitress - if you're here to have a good dinner, do so. Don't let her attitude get in the way. She ruined our dinner.We were here for Friday night dinner for 4... Some advice:1) the door says maximum 4 credit cards - but the waitress will say maximum 2 credit cards. So what's her reason? "Our credit card machine is slow so we can only accepted 2 cards" - what BS. Demand they take at least 4 credit cards because that is the policy on the door. They weren't nice about this one at all. When we got to use 3 cards, it wasn't slow at all. We called their bluff and won.2) take your time to get the order in right. She will come back every minute to push you to order before your jacket is off. But if you're not ready, why push? Tell her you will tell her when you're ready. Don't let her bully you into ordering quickly. We didn't order enough and had to order more, but then she was unhappy with our additional order because she wanted us out within 1 hour of being seated. Seriously? Maybe she should put a countdown timer on my table. That'd be more polite.3) finally, check the math. We tipped 20% but the waitress thought we tipped too little. She chased us out into the street and accused us of being cheap and asked us to pay more. We were shocked. Turns out she couldn't do math and thought we ONLY tipped 15%. To prove otherwise, we added up the numbers for her out loud, then she walks back in, no apology - Disgusted. Rude. You should tip her what you think is right. Her "service" deserved 0% to be honest. 4) tell her you read this review and that her service is notoriously bad - she should change her attitude.I've had enough.
Christina K.}Manhattan, NY}439}127}107}-1}5}1/7/2016}Rarely is my boyfriend OK with waiting 45 minutes for a table. But when we strolled into Shabu-Tatsu during the dinner rush and saw all of the boiling he eagerly gave his name and number.What followed was reasonably priced do-it-yourself euphoria. We went with the prime rib shabu and had so much fun swishing the meat and veggies around to cook. The quality of the food was good - very fresh - and I loved the sesame dipping sauce so much I could have drank it. When all of the meat, veggies, noodles, etc. were gone we found room in our very full bellies for the gratis green tea ice cream and ran down the street for one more drink.
Prianka I.}New York, NY}3}30}0}-1}3}1/6/2016}My friends and I came here on a cold Tuesday night craving for some delicious shabu-shabu. To our disappointment, the broth was bland, the sukiyaki beef was just normal (but over priced), and the portions were minuscule.Maybe I'm just used to the bigger portions and variety of Chinese style "Hot Pot", but having to pay $30 for food that was neither filling nor satisfying is just disappointing.
Kaitlyn P.}Irvine, CA}31}112}235}-1}5}1/4/2016}The service was really great!  Even on Christmas day, the waiter was very sweet and attentive.  The place was very tiny & cute with very yummy food :0)
Limore R.}Manhattan, NY}64}2}0}-1}1}12/30/2015}I have been coming to this restaurant for many years but more consistently since my youngest was 2 years old since it is his favorite restaurant in the city. He is now ten. The greeting i received from the manager when i arrived was essentially "shut the door" not "hello good evening. I will be right with you. But would you mind closing the door." Essentially it was "get out." Last night was my son's tenth birthday and while we didn't have a reservation, we patiently waited the one hour for the table with his grandparents only to find out that we were getting a small table that can fit four and somewhat tight. We were five. And two of us are big. It would have been a very uncomfortable meal. So their grandparents left after the hour so that we could take the small table and eat. Hardly a good solution to a dining issue, but it was late and the children hungry. My son was very disappointed but his grandparents are elderly and didn't want to squeeze. To top it off, the manager of the restaurant had given one of the only two very large tables to a party of two, who had been seated before us and who had remained seated after we had left. It certainly isn't the first time i have not felt welcome in the restaurant by the manager. We will not be returning which should make this angry manager very happy since he didn't seem to like our business. The rest of the staff is and has always been very friendly and courteous.
Bin L.}East Elmhurst, NY}29}348}14}18}5}12/27/2015}Went there for dinner today with a friend. I was put on waitlist for 30 minutes. Went to the table in the basement. Ordered okonomiyaki, roasted duck, umaki, takoyaki, rib-eye beef and shrimp for sukiyaki. I thought that we have to order two servings of each for sukiyaki. However, we ordered one serving of each to share.Another group from the back of us was about to leave when they saw our sukiyaki and were interested.We ended our dinner with ice cream. My friend had green tea while I had chocolate.
Siqi L.}Winston-Salem, NC}4}2}2}-1}3}12/26/2015}BBQ platter always dirty and don't take our words to change one for us. We can recommend shabu, but beef or vega are minimum amount. But the drink calpicol soda is pretty good.
Shelley L.}New York, NY}95}429}1107}18}2}12/22/2015}The last time I ate here was nearly 10 years ago. It's changed. I'm glad they took reservations for 8 because it's a tiny spot. I wasn't too impressed with their shabu shabu - I remember it was great when I first tried it. It was just OK this time. The staff is friendly and helpful when it came to explaining what we were getting. The shabu shabu is a set price, about $25 per person depending on the type of meat you're selecting. We went with the prime rib eye beef and rib eye beef. I would recommend the prime rib beef. It's more tender and good selection of meat. The shabu shabu comes with a variety of vegetables, noodles, tofu and mushroom. All goes into the hot pot where it's boiled. The shabu came with ice cream (your choice of vanilla, chocolate, red bean or green tea) and salad. The soup after everything is cooked is nice and light and would recommend taking a sip. In addition, we ordered takoyaki balls and a salmon bibimbap. Overall it was just OK. I remembered having a better experience in the past so I'm not sure if the quality has gone down or what.
Nuda T.}San Francisco, CA}0}19}13}-1}5}12/15/2015}Price is good. Food is good. Make sure u make rsvp tho. Waiting while hungry isn't fun.
Fang Yu C.}La Fargeville, NY}0}1}1}-1}4}11/28/2015}We order beef chicken pork shrimp sukiyaki. Good but maybe will be better to have another choice of noodles.
Rocanovasta G.}New York, NY}36}134}161}-1}4}11/14/2015}Fresh meats, the sauce can be a little strong. Couple nice complementary dishes. They have great glass noodles.
Vina V.}Redwood City, CA}922}226}3}18}5}11/14/2015}Lone Diners beware. If you want to get Shabu Shabu, you have to place two orders, meaning two orders of meat. I asked if I could place one order and then buy a giftcard so I'm still paying the same amount. It was a no-go so I was about to do Sukiyaki instead, but I got a friend to show up because I was pretty adamant about having Shabu Shabu. The Shabu Shabu is delicious. Get the prime beef--it's only a few dollars more but so worth it. The sauces were perfect. I thought they were a little stingy on the veggies--usually each person gets their own plate of vegetables, but it is NYC after all so maybe they do that to keep prices relatively (NYC-low). The meal also comes with a salad and tea which are nice. When we got our bill, we got charged a random $1.25 Misc fee that I didn't notice until we were signing. I asked them what the fee was for and two people couldn't answer me. Finally, they came out with a new bill saying they charged us incorrectly.. .and saw that we had already signed... but didn't do anything about it -.-. I decided not to fuss for $1.25, but I thought that was pretty shady. So...I'm still giving this place a 5 because objectively speaking, their Shabu was good, just be careful and check your bill and make sure you bring a friend.
Kei S.}New York, NY}0}48}0}-1}3}11/7/2015}Saturday lunch shabu shabu. It's okay but nothing special. The green tea ice cream is good though.
Joanna T.}Manhattan, NY}314}115}117}18}4}11/4/2015}Came here on a Friday night and waited 45 mins for a spot. Probably wouldn't come back again if I have to wait that long but the food was great. It's around $25 per person, a good deal for all the fresh food that you get. Very quick service!
Edwin H.}Manhattan, NY}0}48}0}-1}3}11/3/2015}After so many years of excellence the last 2 visits were very disappointing.The Sukyaki with prime beef was tasteless.One time could be an Exception-2 times is ill boding. Our complaint rec'd little concern  to the situation.Looks like our favorite must be replaced which is difficult to find.
Jenny S.}Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY}0}6}9}-1}3}10/31/2015}They told us the waiting time was around 45mins and we waited for almost 2hours..plus the waitress was very rude ...this place is way overrated! Three star only for the food!
Angie I.}Staten Island, NY}99}44}165}-1}4}10/22/2015}I've been here on two separate occasions - once for the shabu shabu & once for the sukiyaki. Japanese shabu shabu is essentially light to the stomach but still heavy on the heart.  The portions are satisfying and will make your tummy content - but not to the point where you've become overly bloated & about to explode, ready to fall into an instant food coma. I really enjoyed my first experience of the prime rib shabu shabu. Yes, the soup broth is clear and lighthearted, but by cooking the combination of meat and veggies, the soup base instantly explodes in savory flavor. The prime rib literally melts in your mouth, the quality of the meat is divine. The sweet & savory sukiyaki was delicious as well, however I felt the prime rib during this course was not as orgasmic as the shabu shabu course. I'm not sure if it's the method of cooking, the length of cooking time or the quality was a little down this time. -Nonetheless, still heavenly scrumptious. The beaten up raw egg dipping 'sauce' is like the icing on the cake, it did smooth the prime rib out a lot more. I'm not a huge fan of the appetizers, however the squid is decent. I can see myself venturing here quite often for the excellent prime rib during the colder weather around the corner! If you don't have reservations, come right when they open, before dinner time, usually there's no wait and there's availability on tables. Oh & enjoy a creamy red bean ice cream at the end of the meal!
Jay I.}New York, NY}238}666}157}18}3}10/22/2015}It was a japanese style shabu shabu place I tried with some friends on a weekend night.  We ordered seafood shabu shabu, which was ok even though we would have liked it more if the portion was bigger.  The service was adequate and the waiting time wasn't that long considering if was a weekend night.
J Lyvia L.}New York, NY}1}11}0}-1}5}10/12/2015}Went there with my friend last Sunday. Before 5:45pm no wait for party of 2.We LOVE the Prime Beef Sukiyaki!!! It was sooo delicious. The waiter was nice and polite.I'll definitely go back again. Maybe try the shabu shabu next time. 5 stars rating!
Joanna H.}New York, NY}195}225}268}-1}5}10/4/2015}Omg!!! I never liked shabu shabu- probably because I never had the REAL GOOD ones. I think I officially like it now!!! So much food even thought it doesn't look like much and it really fills you up. Beer is relatively cheap! And they're good at making sake recommendations. The Prime Ribeye Beef shabu shabu set is the course we ordered. $26 per person and although the dishes do not look like lot of food, it really is. The meat is great quality and very fresh. Plates of food are served endlessly.. assorted vegetables of hakusai, scallion, carrot, shiitake mushroom and watercress, tofu, kishimen &malony noodles, salad, two kinds of dipping sauces, (I LOVED the peanut-ish one) rice and ice cream. I liked the green tea icecream over the red bean flavor-it really cooled down my hot palate/tongue and it wraps up your dinner refreshingly. The beer is cheep and it's very good to come with a small or big group.
L D.}San Francisco, CA}0}10}0}-1}1}10/3/2015}Really bad customer service.I had tried to call few day in advance, after finally reaching them. The lady on the phone will not take reservations. Still we tried to be optimistic and just do a walk in. However once we arrive there, the lady put us on a wait list but there is no one waiting outside. Really really bad service. Will not recommend this place to a friend or foe.
Mcky C.}Manhattan, NY}107}42}9}-1}2}9/30/2015}Been here before on multiple occasions with my friends and brought clients here, had lovely experience so when my husband wanted to have a romantic Shabu Shabu birthday dinner I thought this was the perfect place. I called and tried to make a reservation but they only accept parties four or more. Fine, we will order for four because we eat a lot. Nope. I tried to explain how it's his 30th and it's a once in a lifetime special occasion. Nope. Let me speak to the manager. I explain. Nope. I beg.. Okay, let me take your name down.. Lost interest and lost my business!
Stephanie Q.}Boston, MA}491}1502}1294}18}4}9/30/2015}To the chorus of Wobble Baby:Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu (yeah)Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu (yeah)Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu (yeah)Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu baby, Shabu (yeah)Cook it in there, yeah, yeahDip it in there, yeah, yeah Grill some meat there, yeah, yeah Green tea ice cream, yeah, yeah Who knew there was Shabu Shabu in New York? You can choose between shabu shabu or sukiyaki- I would recommend choosing shabu shabu. You can choose what kind of meat you want, we chose beef. It also comes with vegetables, tofu, noodles, and rice. You get 2 kinds of dipping sauces to dip your food in. You also get a salad.I enjoyed cooking my food and dipping it in the dipping sauces. The meat cooks really quickly, about 20 seconds. From time to time, someone would come and clean up the stuff that floats on top of the soup, whatever that is called.Its really delicious, you can't go wrong. Its also very filling.To top that off, you get ice cream for desert. You can choose between green tea ice cream and red bean. I chose green tea. After eating all that food, you probably will need to use the toilet. They have the Japanese washlets- the toilet seats are heated (great during the winter), and you can choose to wash your butt. Can't wait to come back.
Kimberly H.}Irvine, CA}340}10}1}-1}1}9/13/2015}Walked in to this place as a party of 1 to try and eat some shabu. The host told me that I needed to order $20 min. I go to order a $25 meal and the waiter rudely told me it was a two order, $40 minimum, wanting me to order food for 2+ people for myself. I told him it's just me and I was told $20. He told me he couldn't serve me. Apparently they don't want my business and I'll never come here again.
Jun T.}Washington, DC}1}22}11}-1}5}9/11/2015}Finally a legit sukiyaki place in NYC! Their sukiyaki lunch special is tasty and reasonably priced.
Patcharaorn T.}Manhattan, NY}112}39}378}-1}5}8/28/2015}The shabu hear are just very very good. I basically tried both Shabu and Nabe and they are both very delicious.For a shabu, if you are a meat person I highly recommended this. The prime beef is very fresh and it pretty much melt in your mouth.For Nabe, if you are a soup person, this is what is good for you. The soup have the sweet taste from the meat and veggies which is heavenly!! For bibimbap , I highly recommend Eel Bibimbap. It's not like other unagi don you ever taste, it's have the sweet and gui feature from the eel and the crunch from the rice as they pressed them again the hot bowl!!
Hatsumi T.}Floral Park, Queens, NY}94}182}478}-1}4}8/13/2015}I have been to three Japanese restaurants which serves Shabushabu, but I like this place the most among three restaurants. (I don't include Chinese restaurants which say they serve Shabushabu, so these restaurants are only Japanese - Japanese Shabushabu restaurants.) Shabu-Tatsu's Shabushabu is very good and not overpriced. I went there twice and ordered Prime Rib-Eye Beef Shabushabu both on the first time and the second time. $27 including vegetable, rice, salad and ice cream is reasonable. The meat quality was very good and delicious. I also liked their rice. It tasted much better than the rice I cook at home. They bring the soup cup with soup seasoning, and you can use the hot water you use to cook Shabushabu to make a cup of soup. The seasoning is very simple. I think it is mostly salt and pepper, but after cooking some meat and vegetables in the hot water, the Umami of the materials melted in the hote water, so I think it makes soup taste good.   They have BBQ and Sukiyaki, so I want to go back there for them. There is 2 minimum order rule for Shabushabu, Sukiyaki and Hot Pot, so if you go as a couple, you have to order the same thing. As many Japanese BBQ place have Korean menu, Shabu-Tatsu serves Kimchi, so I ordered 3 Kimchi assortment(Nappa Cabbage, Cucumber, Daikon Radish). I like the Kakuteki (Daikon Kimch) the best.I went there with my husband between 5 - 6, so there was no problem to be seated, but if you come little bit later or come in a big group, you might have to wait.
Thalie L.}Chicago, IL}90}295}310}18}4}8/11/2015}Food is pretty good and service is nice.We share 2 plate for 3 and it was enough. I like this place. I think it didn't meet my entire expectation because I thought it was grilled BBQ and in fact it is boiled. However it is way more healthy. Pork and beef was tender. there were a lot of vegetable and pasta. I loved the onions and  the egg where you have to dip your food in it. It was something new for me. If you don't know how to do, the waiters will be very happy to help you. the Ice cream was delicious.I am a fan but it miss this little thing to make me wanna come back every night!I will recommend it to my friends anyway!! THANKS!
Minji S.}New York, NY}94}9}4}-1}5}8/10/2015}THE BEST SHABU SHABU IN NYC!I usually get beef shabu-shabu or sukiyaki and they are both great!Shabu-shabu comes with veggies, beef, sauces, rice, and you drink cup of broth at the end.Sukiyaki comes with veggies, beef, egg (which i pour a bit of sukiyaki sauce or a bit more flavor), rice.And you get ice-cream (I like redbean but greentea is also very good) and houjicha (brown tea) after the meal as dessert (free of charge).They don't have much space so either call in advance or you'll have to wait in line.The place is not big enough for large group of parties over 6 or more. If you are craving Japanese and something tasty THIS place is A MUST!
Vicky L.}Seattle, WA}10}498}8}-1}4}8/9/2015}The prime rib eye beef is so gorgeous. Quite healthy food with a reasonable price. Ice cream is not bad too. The only thing is, tooooo noisy.
Kerry G.}Brooklyn, NY}40}219}323}18}5}8/5/2015}Ordered: Prime rib-eye beef and chicken sukiyakiPros--Flavorful and fresh. Fun to cook yourself.Cons--Pricey. Optional raw egg as dipping sauce was a thumbs down.
Trinh And Laurie L.}Brooklyn, NY}46}127}216}-1}5}8/3/2015}We had the Shabu Shabu that we found very good. We ordered a portion of prime beef ($27) and one of pork ($25), they were both very good but the beef one was deliciously tender.The restaurant itself is a bit small, but it is well decorated in a wood style with a nice ambiance. The service was flawless. We would definitely recommend the place, and for sure come back.
Wisha K.}New York, NY}106}14}0}-1}5}7/28/2015}Probably best shabu in town. Staffs are very polite and nice ( the server with glasses and the fluffy hair kind of older guy)
Satridia J.}Brighton, MA}5}42}11}-1}3}7/26/2015}We came here on a Saturday night around 10 pm, and asked to wait for 45 minutes. We were hungry and tired and decided to wait.I eat shabu-shabu a lot back home in Asia, and never found one with hot water "broth" before. At first I was confuse why our waiter didn't gave us any bowls. I thought to myself, how can I enjoy the broth without bowl? I asked for bowl, and the waiter gave us with some spices inside. It's salt and pepper!I still didn't understand at that time. Then, I tried to "broth" for the 1st time and was surprise to realize that I just tasted hot water! *crying silently*It was pretty disappointing for me, as I love to enjoy shabu-shabu broth. I don't know if the authentic shabu-shabu actually use hot water like this. what I know, in Japan there're lots of broth choices, even like soy-based broth (which is delicious), and this hot water "broth" is by far the worst that I've tried.Well, the beef is okay, the sauces is okay also (but if I'm here only for beef, I would order the teppanyaki instead of shabu-shabu).I do appreciate the service, especially from the other waiter (not the first one who served us). He was really polite and nice. Exactly like my Japanese friends! He gave us ice cream (free for the dish I guess). I chose the green tea flavor and it was really good! Like super good! To end our meal, the nice waiter also gave us free hot green tea.I would probably won't go back here soon, because hot water "broth" is not my thing.
Chloe G.}New York, NY}96}173}533}-1}3}6/24/2015}One of the well known Japanese hotpot place. There're not many actually.Good for 4 people group. It will need a reservation and once you are seated, the service is prompt and attentive. If you are in mood, it's a nice alternative for dinner.
Amy N.}Elmhurst, NY}16}9}0}-1}2}6/20/2015}Not my favorite. I'm asian and i expected more than just a clear broth and meat. The hot pot looks plain. Service was ok. I don't think i'll comeback here for hot pot.
Diego S.}Astoria, Queens, NY}13}4}0}-1}5}6/13/2015}I've been to shabu tatsu at least 10-15 times. I always had great service. The food is very authentic, the vegetables for the shabu were always fresh, the appetizers were also delicious (I can't stop thinking about the roasted duck). If you're looking for Americanized Japanese food, here IS NOT your place.The place might a little small inside but for me, it just adds to the experience making me feel back in Japan.
Patrick Y.}Los Angeles, CA}185}101}10}-1}3}6/6/2015}3.5Shabu-shabu is not the same as Chinese hot pot. The Chinese version has a soup packed with MSG, salt, oil, and flavor, while the Japanese version is supposed to be light and bring out the flavors of the ingredients.Unfortunately, for some reason Shabu-Tatsu just gives you unflavored water as the broth for their shabu-shabu. I was perplexed, as my previous shabu-shabu experiences have been with mildly flavored dashi broth.The beef quality is not bad, but the shrimp was not good. They also skimp on the variety of vegetables you get. No fresh mushrooms like enoki and the only green vegetable is napa cappage/hakusai (no shungiku, komatsuna, spinach, etc.). Only a couple pieces of tofu. The appetizers and bibimbap are ok. Ice cream was fine (you can buy the same thing at the grocery store).
Piotre W.}Brooklyn, NY}8}32}4}-1}5}5/19/2015}This place is ALWAYS FANTASTIC!!!! Love , love , love it!!! Highly recommended!!!! My fiancé and I came here years ago and still come back to this day. The service is amazing!!!
Nick M.}Manhattan, NY}283}9}1}-1}5}5/18/2015}Very good place, the food is great and also the atmosphereYou have to go there!Try the sea food bibim bap.
YeoJin K.}Palisades Park, NJ}128}12}8}-1}5}5/12/2015}This is my go to SHABU SHABU place. i probably go here at least once every 2 months? everytime i crave shabushabu.My favorite though is the EEL BI BIM BOP - omg i'm drooling as i'm writing this review. Portions are perfect, service is great, FOOD IS THE GREATEST. Thank you shabu-tatsu for being you...always haha :D
Ivan J.}Queens, NY}1}23}0}-1}2}5/11/2015}Overpriced and the servings were tiny.  The choices for sauce were extremely limited (2 to be exact, wtf).  Everybody has to share the same hotpot, not good for people that don't eat seafood while others do.  I also found it odd that they don't supply strainers to retrieve food out of the hotpot, using chopsticks to do this is VERY tiring.
Jim V.}Manhattan, NY}50}20}0}-1}5}5/8/2015}Perfect place for a novice to try Shabu-Shabu. And so with friends on a Sunday evening we tried, and luckily there was a table for 4 available. Cooking your meal at the table is a great experience and you get to choose what goes in the pot and when to take it out! It was great to have friends who knew the style and could educate this novice. The meal was totally filling, the ice cream was delicious, the tea fabulous. The service was impeccable, and so attentive. They were constantly checking the flame for the pot and making sure everything was fine. A definite must for anyone interested. Suggest you make reservations as this place is small and gets very packed.
Wenjia Z.}Norwalk, CT}3}1}0}-1}2}5/2/2015}We have really bad experience today, the waitress had really bad manners, and asked for more tips, how dare you asking for tips by that service？But the food is really good anyway.
Real M.}New York, NY}5}301}0}-1}3}4/19/2015}I want more! More! The prime rib eye sounded delightful, but the plate was kind of underwhelming. The quantity was on the lower side, and the slices I had didn't have much marbling action. The fat is what makes the meat! I guess since it's not Kobe, it's not as marbly.A beer and a house sake later, I was up to $48 after tax and tip. Service was great though. Maybe the best service we've had in NY so far.
Jason T.}New York, NY}143}110}32}-1}5}4/11/2015}Great spot with great shabu shabu and bim bim bap. Cozy atmosphere. Only downside is there's usually a  pretty sizable wait :|
Mijune C.}New York, NY}43}98}0}-1}4}4/8/2015}Good quality Shabu Shabu, but this place is not a little known secret so it usually is packed. Their bibimbap is also very good~ Great meal for a cold day!
Yilin L.}Rosemont, IL}39}9}0}-1}2}4/6/2015}It turns out you cannot always trust yelp...We missed Zabuzabu that we had in SF, so we searched for a nice place that has shabu. After about one hour wait for a table, we sat down and ordered the premium steak shabu set for two ppl.  It was not enough for two ppl at all. In fact, it was barely enough for one guy.The shabu soup was clear water with two pieces of algae, WITH NO SALT at all. So, until the very end of the meal, nothing comes out of the soup with taste. They all tasted like water. Therefore, we had to dip everything into the sauce to swallow, which we normally don't do when eating shabu. The sauce was concentrated with salt, which seemed to be a compensate for the salt-free soup... At the end, when the soup finally got some taste from all the meat and veggies, they offered two cups with pepper salt in the bottom for soup drinking. This in my opinion was a the worst part of all, because the salt completely overtake the fresh taste of the soup, so it became just salty water...To summarize, I think this place is overpriced and overrated. If you have extremely light taste and are looking for healthy food you might enjoy it. But for others, I don't recommend this place at all.
cy c.}ASTORIA, NY}80}133}0}-1}3}3/28/2015}The line here is always SO long, we finally got the table on the third try.we got prime beef sukiyaki set, everything is good, except the beef unfortunately. even with the heavy sukiyaki sauce it still has a hint of smelly meat taste(when the meat quality is not so good or not fresh).such a shame, cause we like everything else, I hope it's just we got unlucky.
Shelly O.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}6}9}0}-1}3}3/20/2015}came here for dinner with a group of 11 they didnt seem to like big group.. first the restaurant is small, and we were sqeeze in a BIGGEST table they have. The food is good... love how they have different hot pot and shabu shabu...! lesson of the night whre this two are with different soup base where all this time i have assuming they are the same! i will come back again but maybe with smaller group of people.
Max S.}New York, NY}86}39}442}-1}1}3/16/2015}Perhaps one of the worst restaurant in New York state. Tacoyaki tasted like it just came outta microwave. Ika teriyaki was ok since squid is very hard to fail. Shabu shabu was the worst I ever had. If this was the first shabu of my life, I would never had shabu shabu again. If you want to eat shabu shabu at this restaurant i ll recommend you rather make your own shabu shabu at home with the recipes in the internet i will be much better. Customer service? I got my first cup of water when I finished 98% of the meal
Robi T.}Astoria, NY}0}18}4}-1}4}3/16/2015}Yummy Shabu Shabu! grill your fine meats and vegetables, very good quality food, great service, the place is tight and is pretty hard to find a table if you walk in,  and it's a Shabu Shabu you will smell like food. thumbs up!
Marci H.}New York, NY}30}38}352}-1}3}3/13/2015}Came here for the Sukiyaki, it is a bit pricy, and the beef is not fresh enough. 25 per person.
Charles M.}Manhattan, NY}2}22}0}-1}5}3/11/2015}Amazing Ponzu, Sesame sauce was a little too peanut influenced. The Ponzu alone is worth the trip. Don't go when they first open - rambunctious children will ruin the mood for your food.Servers are polite and attentive.
Wei S.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}214}85}2}-1}2}3/9/2015}Having come from a family where we eat hot pot on the reg, I was quite excited to try Shabu Shabu for the first time. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. We ordered 2 beef portions. It comes with veggies, noodles, tea/ice cream at the end.Here are a few reasons it was sub-par:1. Not sure about what the tradition is for Shabu Shabu, but I expected some sort of broth to cook our meat/vegetables in. It was just boiling water, which didn't really contribute to bringing out the flavor of the food.2. The two sauces provided were mediocre. The sesame sauce was decent but pretty heavy. They should have some sort of vinegar/soysauce/garlic sauce. 3. The veggies provided were pretty scarce and cheap. Too much cabbage. Noodle portion was definitely not even enough for one person, let alone two.Overall, the price you pay doesn't really match up to what you get; which, in my book, never warrants a return to a restaurant, no matter how much I love hot pot.
Ben L.}Queens, NY}943}947}2632}18}4}3/8/2015}It's kinda weird but even though Shabu Shabu is a Japanese thing, I oddly don't think of it as Japanese, whatevs. So it's a cute little Japanese hot pot place that has Shabu Shabu as well as yaniku (think Korean BBQ). I had a fun experience and I thought the service, which was mostly Japanese, was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is really popular so waits can be painful and it's not exactly quick food either. The Japanese clientele is a statement in and of itself.The food:All Shabu-shabu Dinner Courses come with assorted vegetables(hakusai, scallion, carrot, shiitake mushroom and watercress, tofu, kishimen & clear noodles), salad, dipping sauces, rice & ice cream. Between the two dipping sauces, the lighter sesame sauce was the clear winner.Prime Rib-eye Beef Shabu-Shabu- Beef and fish are kinda the go to for Shabu. The Prime Rib-eye is really tender and cut paper thin, the waiter tells you to swoosh it around for 10 secs for med rare. As much as I liked it, there wasn't a world of a difference between this and the reg rib-eye.Rib-eye Beef Shabu-Shabu- I thought this was great as well, honestly for the $2 between this and the prime, you should order both to compare but it wasn't really a big difference to me.Salmon Bibim Bap-  Salmon, Vegetables and Rice. This dish was prepared well. The Bibim Bap was served in a hot stone pot and the stone pot gives the rice a nice char and the rice is seasoned well. The salmon is full cooked, it really is more there for texture than taste IMO.Okonomiyaki- Japanese Pork Pancake. It was made well but there wasn't a lot of flavor. The predominant flavor was the Okonomiyaki sauce and mayo, the pancake was just a soft texture with hints of cabbage.Chilled Tofu- w/ Dried Bonito Flakes & Scallion. I wasn't crazy about this, it was cold tofu and you add soy. I wasn't crazy about the coldness or the texture of the tofu, there wasn't a lot of flavor even with the soy addition. For me, I wasn't a fan.
Eileen J.}New York, NY}41}185}0}-1}3}3/7/2015}Came here with the family for a bday dinner.  Made reservation for a Sunday night dinner for a party of 5.  We were seated in the smaller and quieter basement room.  Ordered the following :- 2 Sukiyakis (Beef & Pork)- 2 Shabu Shabu (Beef and Pork)- 1 Beef Tongue BibimbopDefinitely preferred the beef texture over the pork for future notice.  Overall everything was delicious but the fam and I definitely preferred the stronger flavors of the sukiyaki. Japanese shabu shabu is pretty different in terms of flavors of Chinese Hot Pot.  The waitress kept saying how Shabu Shabu is about simple flavors.  Shabu shabu broth was more flavorful at the end when they give a little bowl of salt/pepper and you mix the soup with it which was pretty good.  The meal ended with red bean and green tea ice cream.   The meal was a little pricey but enjoyed the experience.
Kate G.}Brooklyn, NY}3}24}0}-1}2}3/2/2015}this is the place I have been coming for a long time but this was my last time. food is very average,nothing special.beef is great but broth is very plain and tasteless. I wanted to have a quick bite since it was 6:30 as soon as i ordered and food arrived waitress came and told me minimum is $40 to order.  there is better food next door at Rai Rai Ken or one block down on 9th street Hasaki.
Kahlia A.}Cambridge, MA}0}10}1}-1}4}2/27/2015}Haven't seen any shabu place better than this in NYC; yet, the price is quite expensive. My favorite is still Momokawa but Momokawa is too expensive compare with Shabu Tatsu. However, the restaurant is too small and seems like the server rush us to finish the food.
Sylvia L.}New York, NY}323}194}275}-1}3}2/26/2015}I came here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty packed by 6:30 pm. Since I was early, I was waiting for my friends outside. The hostess realized I was outside for a bit and came out and took down my name. Once my friends came, we got seated after ten minutes. The place is small, but the service was impeccable. I ordered the Prime Rib Eye Shabu Shabu and it came with a salad, rice, veggies, and ice cream. It was not a bad deal. The meat was thin and it was a good amount compared to other shabu shabu places. They give two different kinds of sauces and a bowl with salt and pepper later on if you want to try out the soup base. However, the soup base is just water to begin with... which threw me off a bit. I never had plain water as soup base before so I did not enjoy it as much. I have had better flavorful soup bases before. The ice cream that was given at the end was delicious though. Other than that, the food was not bad and the service was great. :)
Tiffany L.}Brooklyn, NY}302}532}429}18}4}2/25/2015}3.5 stars. maybe i'm use to hotpot at home but the portions here are definitely small. my mom and i had the prime beef shabu shabu and felt like there wasn't enough meat. yes, it comes in a huge platter, but the sliced beef is paper thin and after you cook it, it reduces to almost nothing. that said, the place has impeccable service, and the food is good quality. i just think they sliced the meat way too thin.
Louis N.}New York, NY}97}175}261}18}5}2/24/2015}Awesome shabu shabu experience.  The meat were delicious and the portions were better than other places that serve shabu shabu.  There's the minimum order of 2 per table, but the food was so good that I am sure I could've finished that order of 2 on my own.  I had ordered their Prime Rib-eye Beef Shabu-shabu, and the beef was thinly sliced and well plated.It's a small place with a basement that has a few more tables, but just from the sheer size of the restaurant and the time needed to consume table cooked meals, one can see why there would normally be a wait for a table.  Definitely a top choice spot for shabu shabu.
Yang Z.}New York, NY}15}4}70}-1}4}2/8/2015}We came to the restaurant on Sunday at 1:30 for lunch, we wait about 15 mins. We ordered prime beef shabu, shabu. And then we added two ounces beef after that.The base soup is plain with two small pieces of seaweed. Normally I don't like to eat shabu like this, but it came with two different sauces. It tasted good. We also ordered a seafood Bibimbap, and green tea ice cream. The ice cream tasted good too.
Chadsworth E.}New York, NY}1}36}0}-1}5}2/5/2015}If your wallet is feeling right and you respect how good it feels to have a happy stomach after a huge dinner...THEN THIS IS THE FUCKING PLACE! Spot rox my sox
Heather W.}Manhattan, NY}29}360}630}18}3}2/1/2015}I thought this was purely just OK.  Everything was "fine" but not spectacular, in my opinion- we had the $25 set.  I'm not sure if I'd venture back here for any reason, with the hourlong wait, etc...
Lily G.}Holland, MA}6}14}5}-1}5}2/1/2015}The place was packed when we went. Many of the customers were Asians (Japanese?) so that should be a good sign.... The chef and the waiters were all Japanese. Food was very good and authentic. Drinks selection was wonderful. We had to wait for 15 minutes on MLK weekend (Saturday night) so that wasn't bad. The price was the biggest plus. In comparable restaurants around St. Mark's the prices would be at least 40% more. So this was a bargain for us.
Reggie M.}Manhattan, NY}256}297}2475}18}4}2/1/2015}Shabu-Tatsu only accept reservation for a party of 4 or more, but I must admit, I love the idea of leaving your name and telephone number with the front desk and they'd call once a table is ready for you (as a walk-in customer). A great customer service touch indeed.Our party of Three were quite lucky that we did not have to wait too long to dine here. The place is quite small, there are only about ten tables for four, but it was arranged in such way to give customers a feel of privacy and comfort.The service was fast and efficient, we started the dinner with a nice carafe of dry sake with pork gyoza and ika teriyaki; a stir fried squid marinated with teriyaki sauce. Both appetizers are made fresh and delicious. For main entree, the Three of us opted for Shabu-Shabu dinner course.The dinner course includes assorted vegetables (hakusai or Napa cabbage, scallion, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, watercress) it was also served with tofu, kishmen or flat noodles, Maloney noodles, vegetables salad with ginger dressing, dipping sauces, rice and ice cream (vanilla, chocolate or green tea) for dessert.As soon as we finished with the appetizers, the waiter fired up the stove in the middle of the table. And came back with a huge shabu pot with water, together with our choices of proteins; a plate of raw slices of prime rib eye beef and a plate of raw shrimps.I was at first skeptical that we started with a plain water on the shabu pot, but the water turned into a very flavorful broth once we put in the proteins, vegetables and noodles. We also side ordered wonton chicken dumplings to add some texture and flavor to the broth. It was a great dinner choice combined with great customer service, we will definitely come back, and next time its going to be a party of Four in order to avail the reservations.
Alyssa Y.}Jersey City, NJ}1}15}0}-1}4}1/31/2015}The food and service was really good, a little bit pricey for the proportions but what else can you expect for hot pot in the East Village?
Dot C.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}4}7}3}-1}3}1/31/2015}Didnt have to wait too long for a table on a Sunday night, about 15 mins. The place was cosy inside but we were seated very comfortably. Ordered the prime rib eye shabu shabu set and a tender pork belly. Was just enough for two people but if you have more people than that you will definitely have to order something more!The set was supposed to come with rice but the waiter forgot and I had to ask him for it. When he did bring the rice out, we had already finished the majority of the meat and veggies. Sort of pointless to eat the rice plain...The waiters were attentive in that they come every now and then to strain the fat atop the pot and change the heat settings on the stove.Overall, I'd say food + service was average. Nothing to write home about and I'll try somewhere else next time.
Sandy C.}Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY}0}3}1}-1}4}1/11/2015}I like the hot pot, especially the red bean ice cream is a MUST HAVE!Only problem is that the food to be add to the hot pot is not much, if you are a heavy eater, hot pot  is not enough  food for you;) Overall it's awesome, I like the Shabu and recommend it!
Joseph S.}San Jose, CA}123}1345}2517}-1}2}1/5/2015}My friend and I were here for lunch and ordered the  Rib-eye Beef Shabu-Shabu. The meat is good quality, but the broth is just plain water. I know that Shabu Shabu uses lighter broth compare to Chinese Hot Pot, but usually they came in chicken broth or some type of herb broth, Shabu Shabu in plain water is a first for me.The sauce is decent, but boil meat in plain water doesn't really entice my taste buds. And the waitress was going to use the spoon to clean up the oil, hmmm, that's the best part! Maybe I'm missing something, but I had my share of hot pot and Shabu Shabu, this is the first time I ever seen a plain water Shabu Shabu, and I don't like it, so I'm gonna pass.
Wenfan C.}Columbus, OH}271}63}4}-1}4}1/3/2015}Finally got our seats! But we were not so lucky to have BBQ because we only got two seats on the lower floor which can only serve Shabu. So we ordered an extra big meal to treat ourselves. To our surprise, we actually loved their side dishes better. Their potstickers were fantastic and the grilled eel with rice (I'm not sure how they actually call it on the menu) was a definite surprise! And the Prime Rib Eye and Rib Eye Shabu Shabu were authentic and we enjoyed their veggies and noodles too. We also had their sausage and tofu, which were around average. Shabu-Tatsu would definitely be a good destination for a taste of authentic Japanese shabu shabu. But PLEASE NOTE the restaurant will not take reservation of less than 4 people, and walk-ins usually takes 1-2 hours. Come with your friends or be prepared for the wait!
Justin H.}South Pasadena, CA}113}41}8}-1}5}12/29/2014}I don't usually give 5 stars - but Shabu Tatsu was all that I had hoped it would be and more!Though we did have to wait for about 30-40 min on a Thursday night, it was totally worth it (put down our name, walked around then came back). It's a small restaurant, with 8-10 tables plus a few downstairs, hence the usual wait.The service was great and the food even better !Since we were sat downstairs we were a bit out of the way of the rest of the tables but our server was very attentive and came back with more sauces and tea whenever we were out!So the food-We all got beef, rib-eye that is, for $25 and some sake (large for $8-9). After our hot pot of water came out, the full plate of veggies and plate of meat. The meat was top quality and veggies refreshingly crisp! The sauces were also delicious! The sesame sauce (pronounced SHI-row-GO-mah) was my favorite- but the soup of hot pot broth and ponzu sauce was amazing! The noodles were also excellent plus green tea ice cream to end the meal was perfect.For the price, I don't think you can beat Shabu Tatsu( just make sure to get there early )
Nin A.}New York, NY}122}362}185}-1}3}12/23/2014}3.5 Waited about 2 hours on a Saturday night without a reservation. This place is small so if they do accept reservations, I highly recommend you make them. Also if you're not doing the hot pot, I honestly don't see the point of coming to this place given so many Japanese/Asian/Barbecue restaurants in the area. The service was amazingly quick as soon as we got seated. We had the shabu shabu - beef ($27) and shrimp ($25) which came with salad, veggies, tofu, noodles, and green tea ice cream at the end. Since we had to cook our food, it really came down to the sauce. Everything was fresh which was great but the sauce was of key importance. They gave us two different types of sauce which I thought were okay at best. They gave us small bowls at the end with salt and pepper in case we wanted to try the broth. Overall it was a good experience but nothing really stood out.
Yang C.}Jersey City, NJ}9}14}0}-1}3}12/23/2014}Tried shabu shabu premium beef. Soup for the hotpot is just water and one seaweed. If you like traditional hotpot than you might feel disappointed because the soup base is plain. However, shabu shabu is not oily and salty as other hotpot. So really just a personal preference. Shochu is warm and authentic.
Shu Jin S.}New York, NY}116}801}5}18}3}12/21/2014}Rating: 3.5 We arrived at 7pm on a Friday and was told the wait was going to be 1.5 to 2 hrs. I hesitated at first, but then came back in and put our names on the list. The good news is that you can wander around and they'll call you 10 mins before your table is ready.It was good, but not great. Now, don't get me wrong, the meat, particularly the Shabu-Shabu Prime Rib Beef was insanely good. Those thin slivers of delicious meat combined with that peanutty sauce = heaven. Even the pork (that we got on the side) was spectacular. The salad (that comes with the set) was drenched in some pretty delicious dressing. Also, the green tea ice-cream was perfect, in every single way.The broth though? I wasn't really getting much flavor. We also made the error of putting the noodles in WAY too early (wait a little while). Service is very attentive and they have a very good selection of sake. Honestly though, I was more impressed with Hakata Ton Ton...
Russ H.}Denver, CO}23}130}4}-1}5}12/16/2014}Like many of the other reviewers, we found Shabu-Tatsu by accident. Our original destination had a long wait, the alternate site had a "cash only" sign ... Shabu-Tatsu was busy enough to show that it wasn't a dive but slow enough that we were able to get in with a minimal wait.Shabu-Tatsu is one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Unlike most American Japanese restaurants, they actually let you experience the magic of watching your food cook at the table. The shabu-shabu looked good but I really wanted to try the sukiyaki - I wasn't disappointed! The quality of the ingredients was superb and the sauces were flavorful without being over powering. It was a tough call to go with the sukiyaki rather than the nabe ... so I'll have to go back and try the nabe on another night. :)
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}12/13/2014}I tend to bias upward when writing reviews, yet this time there is no bias at all, it is truly worth a five star. We came here for its shabu but later determined to try the sukiyaki.  As always, prime rib eye set is our choice. It was a little bit salty but other than that food quality was of high standard. Compared with momokawa,  I'd say this place is a bit more free style...but yeah,  both are worth trying. Last but not least, go for their ice cream,  it has been included in the set already. Nice way to call an end to the dinner!
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}4}12/12/2014}Nice to find a good shabu-shabu place in the city. Prices are reasonable, especially for lunch, but their lunch hours are a bit unpredictable so be sure to check before you go. We got the special beef combo for two, which was just enough food. Lots of veggies, tofu, and noodles along with the beef, so you feel very healthful and full afterward. Noise was a little bit of an issue the one time we went, mostly because the people next to us were incredibly loud.
Linda G.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}12/5/2014}My children and I have been customers at Shabutatsu for years and absolutely love it! The food is excellent: we really like the bipinbop appetizer, which is a rice dish with meat, rice, noodles and raw egg cooked table side. We inhale the meat or shrimp with vegetables shabushabu! And the accompanying peanut sauce is unbelievably amazing. The host and servers are extremely polite and service is great.The only downside is that reservations aren't accepted for parties under four, so, unless you get there early, be prepared for a bit of a wait.
Diana L.}Honolulu, HI}336}206}343}18}4}12/1/2014}We stumbled onto this place on or way to another establishment. When it is 30 degrees out, something hot will totally do the trick. I love shabu shabu and have had my fair share of it back home. So I figured, why not try this place out in NY?There is a two order minimum per table for the shabu shabu. The portion is actually pretty big and filling. Lots of veggies and meat. The combo comes with a small salad and also ice cream for dessert. Their green tea ice cream is good. Not the typical watered down green tea taste. So make sure you like green tea before you decide to order it. The establishment is small. If I remember correctly, there were less than ten tables that could seat 4 people. Nice and cozy inside. The service was good and fast. I'd definitely come back the next time I am in the area.
Megan A.}Manhattan, NY}47}7}0}-1}5}11/17/2014}My favorite shabu-shabu in NYC. I'm always here once or twice a month. The meat is superb. I've tried their beef, chicken, pork and sea food. It's a great deal because you get a salad then vegetable, noodles, rice and meat for the shabu-shabu, then tea and ICE CREAM at the end. The staff are always nice and attentive. Only down side is there is always a wait.I'd definitely recommend this place. It's a personal favorite and a spot I often take visitors who are in town and they've always loved it as well.
Lijuan L.}Manhattan, NY}4}3}0}-1}2}11/14/2014}Just so so, wanna simple much during weekend, it's can be considered, but never worth for line up.
Frizen Z.}New York, NY}13}8}4}-1}5}11/7/2014}Great food. The Japanese style hot pot is very special and tasty. Also the food is very healthy as well. Will definitely come again!
Xinyu H.}Pittsburgh, PA}11}71}26}-1}5}11/3/2014}Usually need reservation but they recommend us arrive at 5pm to get seats. And we did. Awesome for Saturday dining!We 3 girls shared 2 hot pots (duck and sea food) and 1 eel rice. Eel rice was served first. Believe me it's so tasty. I am usually not a big fan of grilled eel since It's sweet and I've had enough, but this eel rice really stands out!Then we had our pots. Soup base is soy sauce, so it gets a little salty after you put everything in it. If you get it before, you'll love it. I especially love vegetables and I think they go perfectly well with the pot. Hot pots ends with udon. And their udon IS THE BEST. I've always been loving Udon, but this is the best I've ever tried. It's not chewy but like jelly, which reminds you of egg white. Most important, it was a big meal with affordable price! Definitely recommend Japanese cuisine lovers and anybody who wants to dine out with friends (I think the portion is better to share).
Jenny R.}New York, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}10/27/2014}Great food and service!I have been here twice, tried their shabu shabu dinner which was delicious, next time I'll have to try the sukiyaki dinner! I took off one star since it's not as good as the places I have been in Japan, but must say, it is the best in NYC!
Karen G.}Oak Brook, IL}36}67}139}-1}5}10/9/2014}Loved it! Great place and easy to order. We had the prime steak. As all good New York restaurants tight fit and cosy. Good service too.
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}5}10/6/2014}Wow, we got lucky with this one.  After watching an off broadway show, we were hungry around 11pm and found this place on Yelp. We ordered the beef sukiyaki hot pot which was excellent. Sweet salty broth and various veggies.  The serving of meat was generous however, I thought the veggies and the amount of broth was lacking.  We ended up having to order an additional side of veggies.The staff was nice and very attentive with the hot pot, other than not giving any extra broth.We'll be back.
Jim N.}Manhattan, NY}13}52}66}-1}5}10/3/2014}I've been here multiple times and I love this place. I admit that I have only really ordered two things here, and one of them is the shabu shabu which is my favorite! The peanut sauce they serve with it is sooooo good! Atmosphere and service are also great. Be prepared to wait though, nights and weekends can get real busy and it's a small place. Overall, I'd recommend this place. It's a personal favorite and a spot I often take visitors who are in town and they've always loved it as well!
Osman J.}Manhattan, NY}152}256}600}-1}4}9/25/2014}Not the best shabu shabu, not even close, but I think this is the best shabu shabu in NYC. Somebody feel free to correct me wrong.Authentic Japanese restaurant in east village, very good shabu shabu items from prime beef to seafood to veggies and sesame sauces, fully deserves the 4 star.$27 for a prime beef combo that comes with rice, veggie and ice cream? Not bad for manhattan.Always a good time. I wish there's something better though. I do prefer this place over Momokawa.
Dom C.}Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn, NY}8}29}11}-1}4}9/6/2014}Yummy food and small, intimate, place. Flavors and quality of food are really good.
You Z.}New York, NY}9}51}72}-1}3}9/5/2014}Went there several weeks ago. We had a group of 6, and we ordered the shabu-shabu for six (like $30 each). I believe the food was very authentic - clear soup without base, thin-sliced meat and two dipping sauces. As instructed, we added vegetables first, and meat after so that the water soup would get some taste when the meat were ready to eat. The taste is fine, but nothing stands out as really good. And to my disappointment the meat and shrimp we ordered all came very small sizes - barely enough for the girls, not to mention two guys in our group. We came around 5:30 on a Saturday night and got seated immediately.
Danny Y.}New York, NY}27}40}0}-1}3}9/2/2014}My cousins and I came here for dinner, I initially thought it was a strictly shabu shabu place but upon getting seated, it's both shabu shabu and yakiniku. So that's a plus.We ordered the meat + seafood combo for yakiniku plus a few more side orders, scallops, pork belly and white fish.The scallops were highly disappointing, 3 microscopic scallops for $7?, the white fish okay and pork belly was the one that saved what seemed like a never ending circle of disappointment.The seafood consisted of shrimp, salmon, and squid; which were all okay and like the meats, nothing memorable.The cherry on top of this fantastic night was the Berkshire Pork Sausage, it is essentially a basic hot dog. Here I was expecting a pork sausage that will give me a transcendent feeling but it was a let down. The 3 stars is for the service and the kindness of the waiter/waitresses.You can get better yakiniku somewhere else.
M K.}New York, NY}2}122}11}-1}1}9/1/2014}I don't even remember how the food tasted (so obviously it wasn't memorable; I believe the soup base was pretty bland); all I remember was the extreme rudeness given.After getting the bill our group did a honest mistake of miscalculating the tips. One of the waiters came back to announced  that the tips weren't enough and should have been 15%. The attitude was far from friendly - again, I don't ask you to have a I'm your buddy type of attitude, just plain and simple tell me the tips weren't quite enough and give a quick run down. I am one who understand the importance of tips. When we were paying the place wasn't even busy so I don't understand his attitude.Not realizing we had miscalculated the tips, I replied: but the tips were supposed to be calculated along with the amount before tax (in my mind I assumed that's why he didn't think the tips were enough). I stress that my voice wasn't loud nor sarcastic but simply replying. In return, he ANGRILY REPLIED: no, AFTER TAX.ummmm WHAT?Excuse me, tips aren't even mandatory.. it's not the law - it is an indication that a decent service was received...so what kind of gut did he have telling us tips needed to be calculated along with the taxed amount?The food isn't memorable, the price isn't that great and the service is rude which means, not worthy of coming. I do not pay to be insulted.
Adam S.}New York, NY}0}50}0}-1}4}8/19/2014}Nice service, and very tasty food. I recommend coming here and trying this fun style of eating. Cook your own food, and everything seemed to be pretty healthy as well. I got the chicken and beef dishes that comes with a lot of veges too, and came here for dinner.
Michael W.}Pelham Gardens, Bronx, NY}0}3}1}-1}5}8/2/2014}Yummy for the tummy. I'm accustomed to Chinese hotpot, so for me this was a new direction.  Glad I found it. And the sweet beer...deeee-licious!
Mark M.}Los Angeles, CA}4}24}0}-1}1}7/27/2014}The customer service was very bad, also one of the waiters asked for a 15 percent tip, he insisted and we refused.  We had the Sukiyaki, the meat was bland and the seasoning was too sweet.  We're from LA where Ramen and Shabu is prime.  I guess we had high expectations, try another spot!
Jules Z.}Manhattan, NY}219}46}9}-1}5}7/27/2014}Food: excellent. Five star quality and great value for $30 (tax included), you get a three course authentic japanes meal. I always get the sukiyaki prime beef special, never goes wrong.Only caveat: they dont take reservations, so if you come thurs-sunday 7pm or after, be prepared to wait 60-120min.Drooling just thinking about it.
Mar C.}Manhattan, NY}66}152}10}-1}3}7/23/2014Updatedreview}I would recommend against ordering the BBQ since they do not change your metal grate and soon enough all of your delicious expensive meat has a nice smokey burnt flavor... Perhaps that appeals to some but I like medium-rare.
James K.}Spring, TX}26}86}225}-1}4}7/19/2014}A very nice experience here. The food was fresh and the staff was helpful.  We managed to make it in for an early dinner at 5pm when they re-open. I really enjoyed their little facility. The place maybe holds 8-9 tables of various sizes.  Warning the food was very good, but this was not a formal Japanese environment where you sit on the floor, ect...  Expect more of a casual environment.  Expect about $30/person for the prime ribeye Shabu-ShabuLiving in the south I forget that not everyone gives free refills.  I got tagged for three glasses of iced tea before I realized I was being charged for each. Bad on me, but be warned.
Peter Y.}New York, NY}118}18}1}-1}5}7/9/2014}This is our go-to Japanese Shabu-Shabu spot in Manhattan.  Never disappoints and you can always expect friendly service yo further boost this always engaging dining experience.  The quality of the meat and veggies for the communal hot pot is top-notch and they have a great red bean and green tea ice cream to finish off the meal.As this spot is always in high demand, would recommend you call and make reservations if you're arriving with a group.
Hara W.}New York, NY}206}65}43}-1}4}7/1/2014}Very very authentic and delicious!!! We came in a group of 6, and had a full pot of shabu shabu followed by another full pot of sukiyaki. The beef and the vegetables (tofu, mushroom, etc) were light and tender. The sesame dipping sauce gave it just the right touch of flavor. A full meal came with a Japanese sesame dressing salad as a starter and your choice flavor icecream (green tea, red beans, vanilla, etc) as dessert.GREAT for group setting! and the area has some great Japanese tea houses for afternoon tea before heading over for shabu shabu!
Lin C.}New York, NY}581}85}287}-1}2}6/30/2014}I came with my boyfriend for a Christmas dinner and it was his first shabu shabu experience. It felt like such a disappointment on my behalf as well. We ordered a beef platter and shrimp platter. I felt like I've been to better shabu shabu places for the price we paid.
Chris H.}Los Angeles, CA}741}574}1902}18}4}6/6/2014}My first Shabu-Shabu. The area is really nice with so many restaurants you can choose from.  In our case, we walked in and was told wait time is 1 hr or more.  To kill time, we went to a dessert place 4 doors down.  That place was awesome but that's another story.I did not know the difference between shabu shabu and hotpot, then.  Now I do.  The meat in this place was really good.  Our meal came with veggies and several meat options.  All sliced thinly for fast cooking.  They give you several sauces to dip the meat in.The lighting was not too bright, not too dim.  After the freezing cold outside, the warmth felt great.  I welcomed the sight of steam rising from the pots boiling in the middle of each table.  The muted conversation from other tables.  The place was pretty intimate.  A nice place for a date.  A nice place for firsts.
Greg R.}Garwood, NJ}0}2}0}-1}5}5/28/2014}Really authentic and delicious.  The prime beef was literally melt-in-your-mouth.  Vegetables were so fresh and the sauces were top notch.  Order the gyoza and fried tofu for an appetizer.  You won't be disappointed.  The yuzu cocktail was amazing too.  We will be going back very soon.
Aly Y.}Morristown, NJ}12}264}12}-1}4}5/18/2014}It was a chilly Sunday afternoon.  After seeing a Broadway matinee, we decided we wanted to eat shabu-shabu to warm us up.  Shabu-Tatsu hit the spot.  We arrived early - at 6pm - which was good because as we were exiting the restaurant at 7:30pm, there was a line waiting to get in.  We started out with Japanese BBQ, then went for the shabu-shabu.  We ordered alot of prime rib eye beef - yum.  Service was friendly and efficient.  It's not a big place so prepare to wait if you go at peak dinner time.
Min N.}Gramercy, Manhattan, NY}3}8}6}-1}5}5/15/2014}The hot pot here is so authentic and i really enjoyed the environment. There are several combos to pick for costumers while all of their amount is huge! I recommend this restaurant especially for cold weather! I suggest more people to eat and its better for three to share two combos:)))
Nishan M.}New York, NY}55}79}0}-1}4}5/12/2014}I love this place, the shabu shabu with the rib eye is one of those classic dishes that are just simple yet sooo good. Its pretty much a bowl of boiling water that comes with raw rib eye (thinly sliced) and a plate of veggies, noodles, etc. The order comes with 2 dipping sauses which make everything so much better. I think 4 people is the ideal number of people to go with because its a really good meal for conversation. Either way the place is great, they dont however take your res if you arent in person but all in all worth it.
Stella Z.}New York, NY}22}187}46}18}3}5/1/2014}Food is fresh, but the hot pot soup base is just plain water, a little bland for me.
Celia Y.}Astoria, Queens, NY}649}335}530}-1}5}4/28/2014}For $25/person you can get a full course dinner meal here. Although I thought 1 platter of meat wouldn't be enough, I'm so sure the portion sizes were carefully measured to ensure that you'll be full and getting your moneys worth. I opted for the sukiyaki here which was amazing and I was so glad they give you a raw egg too. Sukiyaki isn't the same without the meat dipped in the raw egg! With the sukiyaki dinner comes salad appetizer, assorted vegetables (hakusai, scallion, carrot, shiitake mushroom, watercress, tofu, kishimen & healthy shirataki noodles), choice of meat, rice, and ice cream. The waiter was attentive and had excellent music playing (daft punk for the win!) and the vibe of the place was very relaxed and calming, although small. Ideally I would've liked more meat but with everything together, it was the perfect amount of food so I left completely full and satisfied. Next time I would like to try their bibimbap!
Alex G.}Broward, FL}39}963}377}-1}5}4/27/2014}Yes, you'll have to wait.  And yes, it's worth it!  We opted for the Shabu Shabu meal, with meat and (extra) shrimp.  The meat was absolutely beautiful - well marbled and thinly sliced.  We ordered a side of udon noodles, and enoki mushrooms, just to give it some added texture.  The two "sauces" it came with were well made and super flavorful, and you could spice it up with accompaniments if desired.  Salad, ice cream, and after dinner tea all included.  Nice!  If you like Shabu Shabu, this is an awesome, popular option in the East Village.
Ben W.}New York, NY}516}773}435}18}4}4/12/2014}Dip, dine, drink, dip some more.It was still a little chilly last Sunday, so we thought a nice pot of shabu shabu would be the perfect thing to warm us up. When we arrived, our wait was a little over 20 minutes, but they were very quick to seat us. Tip: when you put your name down, they'll call you 10 minute before your table is ready, so feel free to roam East Village while you wait.By getting the shabu shabu, it's a full meal, complete with salad to start and ice cream to end. We went with all prime beef platters and watched as they switched our grill grate out for a pot. Our salads came out first, dressed with miso dressing. As the water began to boil, our server came out and gave a great demo, explaining how everything worked, what each of the tools were used for (fat skimmer!), even getting our first servings prepared.Along with the slices of thin meat, there's also a veggies platter, complete with cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and 3 different types of noodles, just to name a few. Each person gets a bowl of short grain rice and two dipping sauces, a citrus soy and a sesame.Now for the eating: at first, I was afraid we weren't going to have enough food, but by the end I was shown up. The beef was the first to go, each of us grabbing those thin slices and swishing them in the broth, 5 seconds for rare, 10 for well done (according to our server, although I just eyeballed it usually). I wasn't really a huge fan of the sesame sauce and primarily used the citrus soy. It had a sour, yet savory feel, and I felt like it complemented the flavors, whereas the sesame was overpowering. The veggies were okay, but I loved the noodles. Each had a different shape and texture to them and I loved being able to slurp them up with the now beefy broth. They also gave everyone a tea cup with salt and pepper in the middle of the meal for broth drinking. I finished my savory portion of the meal with that. Ice cream came shortly after; we got a sampling of green tea and red bean, as well as cups of tea.Experience wise, this is probably the most intensive shabu shabu I've had. The service was amazing and if you're a beginner, it's a great stepping stone. I won't be going every chilly evening, but if I'm in East Village and need to warm up with friends, this makes the short list.
Yin M.}Brooklyn, NY}121}56}7}-1}4}3/19/2014}Loved this place! Great value for price and the service is wonderful.It was my friends' birthday and they dimmed the lights when they came out with the cake! They also had already lit the candles for me! It was over the top.
Sam S.}New York, NY}9}7}2}-1}5}3/19/2014}I think I could eat at Shabu-tatsu everyday and never get sick of it. The prime rib Shabu Shabu is my go to order it comes with salad, rice, ice cream and green tea.. its actually heavenly. The bimbimbap is amazing and they make it in front of you. The only downside is you cannot make a reservation unless you are with a large party and recently there has been long waits.
Fernando G.}New York, NY}29}38}24}-1}4}3/18/2014}My wife and I had Shabu Shabu for two which comes with a side of rice, small salad and ice cream for each  person. It was amazing, great deal completely satisfied. The place is small and vibrant. Great if you are starving and would like to enjoy with friends and family. Good service.
Neal N.}Chatham, NJ}420}393}651}-1}4}3/16/2014}This is my first time at a full fledged hot pot spot. This place is a bit cramped and the wait can be a bit long. The main reason why the wait is so long is because they don't rush people out, and I can appreciate that. Unfortunately, they haven't implemented a system to contact people when their table is ready (cell phone, buzzer). We ended up missing the time they called our name. We opted for sukiyaki. My cousin and her friend got ribeye, and I felt the extra $2  for prime ribeye was worth it. It was definitely fattier than the non-prime, but it wasn't super crazy marbled. They also provided a lot of vegetables and two types of noodles along with rice. I was definitely more than full, and we didn't finish all of the food. I still made room for the ice cream though!The service is really good. Really polite. Really patient. And they have a good selection of sake (4 bottles each of junmai, junmai ginjo and junmai daiginjo).Overall, good food, great service, but cramped spacing and a long wait with no way for them to contact you if you leave the restaurant.
I-Hsin L.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}0}4}1}-1}1}3/8/2014}Multiple friends have been to this restaurant but totally do not recommend here for the same reason. The service was not good but request more than 18% tip for parties of two. Kind of humiliating customer.
Bob K.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}3/8/2014}Food is ok!! They pay too much attention on the tips. I gave them 18% for dinner and they are not satisfied with that. Want me to pay more tips. I won't go there anymore.
Henry O.}Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA}83}59}14}-1}3}3/4/2014}Was wanting some good Shabu and all the recommendations and research to good Shabu led me to this place. Went during lunch time on a sunday and there wasn't a wait at all. Decided on 2 orders of the prime beef shabu. When the meat came it looked like only one order, but they assured us that it was two orders. I can't imagine how small 1 order would have been.Food was good, but def not worth the $. Ive had a lot better for a helluva lot cheaper
Yi J.}Stamford, CT}147}14}1}-1}3}3/2/2014}Was there with my wife. Great food & services. Liked it so much we try to go there again during lunch hour. However, was being told by the server that the restaurant is closed while it is 2:45, clearly it should follow its operation hours no? Left very disappointed, will think twice before going back there.
Jonathan N.}Manhattan, NY}150}97}149}-1}4}3/1/2014}Beautiful hotpot. You know the place is legit if the servers are actually Japanese. The place is fairly small. They have a small downstairs area (3 tables). The wait can get pretty long as this place gets pretty popular around peak hours so try to come early! One of my favorite things about this place is that they don't rush you as you enjoy your hotpot. Very hospitable. We ordered the shabu hotpot selection with pork, beef and prime sirloin. All very good. The servings were enough and each person got their own sauces, salad, hot tea, and ice cream. It's about 25-27 per person, which is a pretty good deal for all the stuff you get. The hotpot comes with a ton of vegetables and noodles. The broth is alright.I definitely want to come back to try to sukiyaki and maybe some of the other appetizers.
Marie M.}Bronx, NY}3}4}0}-1}2}2/23/2014}Went here with a group of four on a Saturday night. It was our first time trying hot pot. The food was pretty good I ordered a pork belly appetizer, which was amazing and order more pork for my hot pot. The pork was good, but the broth was borderline tasteless even after we literally dumped every vegetable on out table in it.  The real issue I had with this place was the wait staff. Our waitress basically ignored our table for the entire meal, never asked if we liked our food and in the 2.5 hours were were there never refilled our water. But the worst part was after we paid the meal on a debit card a different waiter came back to our table to inform us that we failed to leave a tip. We planned on leaving a tip in cash, but his clarification cost him a deduction.
Jenny H.}Brooklyn, NY}40}15}0}-1}1}2/22/2014}Went here for a friends birthday dinner. The waiter was very informative and explained it well. Ordered the three types of appetizers which were all too salty. Miso soup is horrible. Didn't really like the hotpot or barbeque. They have the best green tea and red bean ice cream I ever had in my life. Not worth it.
William D.}Brooklyn, NY}4}120}56}-1}4}2/10/2014}I went to Shabu-Tatsu (ST) a couple weeks ago. I decided to take some of my college friends a food tour of New York City, and I thought ending with Shabu Shabu would be the best way to end the day. Boy was I right.I first heard about ST a couple years ago from a close friend, who happens to be Japanese. She knew I loved Japanese, and suggested I try this place. Fast forward to few weeks ago, I finally got to try shabu shabu.Before I write about the actual restaurant, I want to give fellow yelpers advice if you want to dine here for dinner on the weekend - Make reservations! I read reviews on here and other sites about the wait, so I made a reservation about a week in advance. I was going with a decent size group, 7 people. so I wanted to make sure we eat at the time we planned to. Good thing I did because when we arrived, those without a reservation had a 2 hour wait! To be fair, it is a pretty small restaurant. The restaurant is also very accommodating if you reserve in advance as well. My group grew to 10 people, and about 2 hours before my reservation, ST called to confirm. I asked them if we could make it 10, and they agreed, but cautioned me we would have to squeeze. The experience started off well without us even being there.Now on the to the review. The ambiance seems pretty traditional, bamboo everywhere. They were right in saying some of us had to squeeze. Luckily I didn't have to as I was given a chair to sit on. The majority of us shabu shabu. Pork, Ribeye, and Prime Rib were ordered. They begin the meal with soup and salad. They then bring the meat out. The sauces they bring to complement the meat were peanut and ponzu sauces. Ponzu is similar to a citrus flavored soy sauce; I really enjoyed this sauce. I'm not a big fan of peanut sauce. Everyone received a bowl of rice. The cut of meats looked like pretty good quality. They also brought out a large plate that consisted of vegetables, tofu, and noodles. After we finished most of the meat, we threw in everything on this plate. Once the waiters saw were finished with the meat, they gave us bowls with a little seasoning at the bottom ( I think it was just salt and pepper) to eat the rest of the meal as a soup. The broth tasted so great with the flavoring of the meat. It felt like were eating two dinners! The experience ended with a bowl of ice cream for everyone. I had their green-tea ice cream, which tastes like everyone other green-tea ice cream I've had - really good. This was a great end to a great day. I will never forget this experience. To see my college friends loving it, to see my old friend who recommended this place, it was one of those moments you wished wouldn't end. If you want to have an amazing experience with your food, give this place a try.
Tom Y.}Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}100}53}186}-1}4}2/7/2014}2 star:  I might be a little biased b/c we went really early at 12 pm (when they are open) on a Friday. The waitress provided us excellent service and we got our food really fast. We ordered a regular shabu shabu and it was more than enough for my two friends and I. We were given rice to complement our shabu shabu. When we were done, we were eaten give ice cream. It was a perfect ending to a great meal.2 star: The place was VERY clean and spacious, but there are quite a few long tables--maybe nine total!Highly recommend it and Would definitely come back again!
Julie Y.}New York, NY}142}320}1}-1}5}2/7/2014}The sukiyaki is amazing... the egg... This is the only place in NY where I have found (outside of CA) where they give you the egg to dip your meat and veggies in...The place is clean, seating is spacious, service is good, food is yummy...Trust me and go with the beef... Wait isn't too bad for a table... Already been there twice in a month!
Annabel A.}New York, NY}47}161}0}-1}3}1/30/2014}3.5 stars. For those who love hot pot, Shabu Tatsu offers Sukiyaki, Special Nabe and Shabu-Shabu dinner set courses. Dinner set courses are all-inclusive with selection of meats + vegetables + dessert. Slightly pricier than if you were to do it yourself at home - expect to pay about $30-40 per head. I find the Shabu Shabu average. The thin slices of meat are great, but the soup was strangely bland, even after throwing in and boiling all the ingredients for half an hour - and this is coming from someone like me who is very fond of "bland" food having grown up on steamed, "everything must be boiled in a pot" food. I don't know how other Yelpers have found it flavorful. The Special Nabe soup has more flavour because the broth is already flavoured when it is brought out to you and contains all the ingredients you've pre-selected. I still found it slightly sweet for my taste, but still much better than the Shabu Shabu soup. The Sukiyaki broth is alot sweeter and thicker. It was delicious, however I needed our waiter to bring a pitcher of water to dilute the broth so that it would become more of a soup rather than a gravy. It's great to eat with a bowl of rice though. Highlight of my meal was the Bibimbap. Definitely comparable to Bibimbap's i've had at authentic korean restaurants. I would come here purely for the Bibimbap. Even my sister who tries to abstain from carbs had to cave and eat some. Dessert selection (which is included in the set) is ice-cream - green tea, chocolate and vanilla. Tip for yelpers: Get the Nabe, and definitely get a side of Bibimbap.
Kia H.}Brooklyn, NY}72}110}142}-1}3}1/30/2014}The first stop of my celebratory night of birthday eating. The wait was 30-45 min, which I was prepared for thanks to Yelp. We decided to go to the sake bar next door while we waited. The tables next to the front door are the worse, in my opinion, because it is freezing outside and the draft is slightly unbearable. Also, the oven enclosure makes it impossible to stretch your legs out underneath the table.The food:The gyoza was very tastyThe salad was good, I enjoyed the dressing very muchThe prime rib eye shabu shabu was very niceThe meat was greatThe veggies were good tooThe green tea ice cream was amazingOverall, I really enjoyed myself and ate way too much. Next time I'll skip the Sapporo and opt  for another glass of sake from Hi-Collar. I may or may not return but at least I can say that I tried it once!Fyi: Everyone must order something, the menu has a minimum order policy.
Kristina P.}BEECHHURST, NY}145}126}62}-1}3}1/27/2014}Been here twice, I'd give it 3.5 stars.Had to wait about 30 min to be seated but we went to chickalicious (amazeballs) down the block meanwhile so it wasn't that bad. Shabu shabu is ok, we got the prime rib eye and the quality of meat is pretty good. But the broth and the sauce are nothing to write home about. We also ordered some appetizers: eel/egg omelette was delish, roasted duck was ok and the pork belly was too salty.Service wasn't that great, they didn't really explain anything. I kinda had to figure things out on my own (I just dumped the scallion and radish thing they gave us in my sauce, did I do it right?). My friend and I were confused when they nonchalantly put down the mugs with salt and pepper towards the end of our meal and walked away. I had to flag them down and ask (no, they are not mugs, they are soup bowls for the broth).I love the location though since it's on the same block as chickalicious!
Nellie C.}Flushing, NY}41}15}1}-1}1}1/24/2014}Never have I ever experienced anything worse than the treatment we experienced at this horrible little hyped up place.  We get there expecting a wait at 930 pm on a frigid Friday.  After being told that it would be 45 minutes, we dutifully waited to get called.  Unfortunately, 50 minutes into the wait, the wait staff with his thick accent came out to personally fetch us.  Finally seated, warm and happy...the waiter comes over to insinuate we took someone's reservation because we couldn't understand his Robin versus Nellie.  Unceremoniously, we were chucked out of our seats without so much as an apology over something clearly his fault.  Speak better English buddy, learn some manners and kiss my money plus everyone I know good bye.
Sena B.}Brooklyn, NY}1}41}0}-1}5}1/22/2014}This place is my FAVORITE Japanese restaurant in the city. A lot of this has to do with how I grew up on this food during the winters (ah memories), but it also just has to do with how great the food is. I take all of my friends here to experience great authentic Japanese hotpot. They serve BBQ here as well, but you have to go for the Shabu Shabu. I don't like to tell people what they should get, so I'm just writing what I typically order:1) Order the Tokusen Shabu Shabu - this should be the highest quality of meat on the Shabu Shabu menu. It also comes with a starter salad and ice cream for dessert.2) If you're with three or four people, order the Bimbim Bop as a starter. You get about a bowl of rice so it's pretty perfect.3) Get a bowl of white rice with your Shabu Shabu Meal4) Save the Udon noodles for after you meat and veggies, when you basically eat it with the soup from the Shabu Shabu. You'll get a bowl with some salt and pepper already in it. Put the soup (and some of the leftovers of your soy based sauce) in there and enjoy your udon.5) When you get the complimentary ice cream with your meal, get half green tea and half red bean. The two together is heavenly. You also get green tea which also pairs well with ice cream.FYI - there's a way to prepare your sauces that I feel really enhances the flavors of the meat and veggies in the hotpot.- Add the green onions and pink daikon pulp into your soy based sauce- Add the hot red paste and the hot oil bean paste (it comes in a little push bottle that's red/orange - "Ryayuu") into the peanut based sauceMeat can be enjoyed in both sauces. Veggies I prefer in the soy based sauce. Enjoy and spread the food love!
Eric D.}New York, NY}3}62}0}-1}5}1/19/2014}Good every time we go.  Great value and delicious food.  We typically get shabu shabu for two with prime beef.
Thomas C.}San Francisco, CA}54}651}189}18}4}1/18/2014}This places offers the thinly sliced meat in three ways: shabu shabu, sukiyaki and yakiniku. Unlike Korean BBQ places their yakiniku doesn't cause the whole place to smell like oil. The shabu shabu had a fair amount of meat although you probably have to add an extra plate or add some appetizers.
Jeffrey O.}Brooklyn, NY}7}43}3}-1}5}1/18/2014}If you're looking to have a delicious meal, GO HERE!Order the Suki Yaki!  They will place the pot in the center of the table and start cooking it for you, then you continue to add the plate of ingredients and cook to your liking, PERFECT dinner.  You will leave happy, full, and thinking "WOW I should have tried this sooner"
Eileen C.}Queens, NY}58}147}79}-1}3}1/18/2014}This review only reflects the shabu shabu.I would really give this place more of a 3.5. For $27 (minimum 2 orders), I got the prime rib eye set that comes with salad with the sesame ginger dressing, noodles, veggies, rice, 2 dipping sauces, and ice cream. Prices are okay and did get me full but it was just very plain to me.. Maybe I'm just used to the Chinese version but it was like the star ratings say- "A-OK".The meat, thinly sliced, was good. The soup was plain. I dipped my meat and veggies in the sesame dipping sauce (which I loved) and the sauce carried over into my rice. The veggie selection isn't bad. The noodles were okay. The salad's dressing was not that good- it wasn't sweet enough, like other sesame dressings. Got the green tea ice cream at the end and that was good (but I doubt they actually make it... Haha).Overall, it's a nice place to go with friends on a cold, winter night if you don't want something that heavy and more simple. As a table of four on a Friday night, we didn't have to wait as we had made reservations at 8pm.. However, they do try to rush you out as they have customers waiting. Service was fine.
Dana F.}Bergen County, NJ}184}140}100}18}4}1/17/2014}Where to begin!!???Me and my sister came into the big city on a Saturday just for this meal. We got in early because we knew there would be a long wait had we not. The restaurant opens at 5 and we got there around 4:45 and there was already a couple on line. As it got closer to 5 there were about 10 other people waiting outside.5 on the dot they open the door and we were showed to our table. The tables are roomy, but if you have long legs you might need to slant them to the sides because of the hot pot in the middle.We started with an app of beef tar tar with raw egg on top. YUM. Im a sucker for raw anything so I already knew i was going to love this. Then we ordered our shabu. We got the a and the b. The only difference was that one was prime beef as opposed to the other.They turn the hot pot on and bring out the veggies/ noodles. And then the meat. The meat is sliced thin, similar to meat you would find on a cheese steak, but not as delicious. Now if this is your first time here you would automatically just throw everything in the hot water without knowing the correct process. First you put in your veggies in the water, let the water flavor up. DO NOT PUT NOODLES IN. Then you can start dipping your meat to cook. It takes like 30 seconds. Meat come up perfectly cooked to your liking.After you finish your meat and the majority of your veggies, you then put your noodles in. All of the water gets flavored from the veggies and meat, and that water flavoring goes into your noodles. The waiters give you a bowl once they see you have finished the meat and are onto the noodle part, so you can scoop out the broth and noddles and voila instant ramen.Then you receive a scoop of ice cream. I chose green tea because its my favorite. They have a nice list of sake , we ordered their house which was i believe 9 or 10 for the full carafe. The meal goes by quick,  took about an hour. You really cant lounge around and hang out, because they are trying to turn tables quickly. By the time we left at 6is there was already over an hour wait.
Xima P.}New York, NY}87}182}111}18}5}1/9/2014}Sukiyaki pork and prime rib were super tasty! It comes with plenty of vegetables and well-cooked sticky rice too. The staff was very helpful and showed us the whole process, and checked in various times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and doing okay with the cooking at the table. It's a cozy, casual vibe, the kind of place that's perfect for a night with friends. Not to mention, heard of this place through recommendations from various friends.
Maggie W.}Staten Island, NY}0}7}2}-1}3}1/6/2014}This is the Japanese version.  I love the Chinese shabu shabu hotpot way more. It have more flavors and taste to it.  This place is decent just not much of flavor for taste. .
Big B.}New York, NY}248}662}16}-1}2}1/4/2014}I dont think it is a good place to go. Cant even find food to make us full...
Kris H.}Silicon Valley, CA}376}478}1807}18}4}12/25/2013}We are definitely fans of Shabu Tatsu.  Perfect for a wintery night.Rainy, freezing night in NYC.  The wait was tolerable.  We were seated downstairs, which was cozier and a bit quieter.  Loved the nabeyaki hot pot. Fresh seafood.  Warm sake.  Totally hit the spot.  Very good service.
Steven L.}Manhattan, NY}1231}679}3940}18}4}12/23/2013}I would come here just for the Bibimbop, not for the Shabu Shabu (prefer the Chinese version where I make my own sauce, and dump it into water to make it flavorful or drown my food with the BBQ and soy sauce).They take reservations for parties, but if you have 10+ people, it's going to be a tight squeeze around the biggest table they have and some will need to sit on a folding chair.Our group ordered the Sukiyaki and the regular Shabu Shabu.  If you're going to order any of the entrees that uses the stove on your table, you must have at least 2 orders per entree.  Choices range from beef, chicken and seafood as your raw ingredients.  They both seem to have similar combo ingredients: noodles, mushrooms and veggies.Shabu Shabu really looks exactly like the Chinese version where you dump all your raw ingredients into a hot boiling pot of water and wait 5 minutes until it cooks everything up.Sukiyaki is exactly like Shabu Shabu but instead of water, they use a brown sweet and salty mix as the broth.  I would prefer this since it's more flavorful and your food will not taste bland and no sauce dipping would be required.Ordered a beef and seafood Bibimbop which was surprisingly the highlight of the meal.  Although they didn't cook it at our table so we can glare at them, they cooked it in the back because we had such a big group and there was no more real estate left on our tables.  The rice was charred just right and mixed really well.  The rice was some crunchy and some soft, but very very flavorful. Service was good and attentive and staff was very on point.  This place probably has the best bibimbop in the City, probably better than most Korean place and they're usually known for this dish!
Sally C.}San Francisco, CA}1051}406}232}18}4}12/21/2013}Probably the best shabu shabu in Manhattan. If you've never had shabu shabu before, it's definitely worth giving it a try. Really good quality thinly sliced meat and spread of veggies. They also give you bowls to drink the soup broth with, something I've never seen in any shabu place.Reasonably priced food and drinks. I recommend the yuzu sochu drink, which was delicious and not overly sweet. Set menu also includes ice cream (choice of green tea, red bean, vanilla or chocolate)!
Luna A.}Manhattan, NY}54}56}10}-1}1}12/5/2013}Stay away. You wouldn't get full unless you spend a ton of money here. The portion is too small and the soup base lacks flavors. Our group of four ended up paying so much like $200 for the terrible hot pot that didn't even make up half full. What a waste. AND whenever our server passed by near us, some kinda strange and disgusting odor bothers us so much. Eww.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}4}12/1/2013}Located next to curry-ya, Hi-collar area on 10th st. in the E. village, this little shabu shabu restaurant serves up some pretty delicious meats.  We tried their prime shabu shabu for 2.  Meat was melt in your mouth goodness.  Comes with veggies, some tofu, and some noodles.  Comes with 2 dipping sauces, ponzu and sesame.  The food was good and it definitely hit the spot on a cold day.   The restaurant is small, so you may have to wait or call ahead.
Irene K.}New York, NY}80}16}31}-1}4}11/24/2013}I would give 3 1/2 star if I can do so on the scale. The service was good but the food was ok. We came here because it got cold and we were craving for hotpot. But this place is crowded on a Saturday night. We got there around 7:30 and waiting for an hour and a a half for our table. The restaurant allows you to put the name down and call them in 45 minutes to see if the table is ready so you don't have to wait there the whole entire time. My friend and I each got a shabu entree, prime ribeye ($27) and regular ribeye ($25), they are both really good. Entree comes with vegetable, meat, rice, salad, and ice cream for dessert. I would recommend this place but I don't think it's worth the 1 1/2 hour wait.
Gary H.}Manhattan, NY}12}7}1}-1}3}11/16/2013}It's okay. We got there super early - as soon as it opens - to avoid the queue. I guess this applies to most restaurants in St. Marks on weekends.We ordered Prime rib-eye dinner sets, which included the beef, various vegetables, a small bowl of salad and ice cream as the deserts. The set cost $27, not really pricy.The beef was of good quality and I like the sesame sauce (sort of) they provide. Generally the hotpot is very different from the Szechuan style that I am used to, but I have become more and more like the plainer edition of hotpot.Oh, and I love the decor (traditional Japanese style).
Elle P.}New York, NY}22}43}1}-1}4}11/8/2013}Stopped in for a huge pot of shabu tonight - nothing beats the cold like this hearty self-made stew. Our small group of 3 had a  40 minute wait until we could sit down. We ordered the select prime rib shabu, shrimp dumplings, pork belly, and red bean/green tea ice cream.And it was a feast.I have to give rave reviews to the pork belly appetizer, because our entire booth devolved into sighs and moans of ecstasy. And although it seems like a weird thing to compliment, the green tea ice cream was superb. Not that typical syrupy sweet gaijin-friendly flavor that is so common in restaurants around town, but instead delicately smoky as it was meant to be. We all left full and happy. ありがとう ございます！
Bill G.}Short Hills, NJ}10}47}12}-1}4}11/5/2013}On a cold evening in a hip part of town, the Shabu Shabu is just the ticket. Thumbs up on all aspects, of food, service, atmosphere and value. Even on an early Tuesday evening the place was busy. Looking around I think I was the only non Japanese patron. Must say something about this place. While I was on a date, I could see this place as a lot of fun with a group of friends and the right sake selection. Next time definitely.
Velina L.}New York, NY}283}558}9}-1}4}10/25/2013}Perfect for a cold day, this is a great way to have an interactive meal.  We had the shabu-shabu (although they also have sukiyaki, yakiniku, and nabe options available) and selected to have the prime rib-eye dinner.  Huge mountains of food arrived swiftly including lots of vegetables, two types of noodles, and of course the thinly sliced beef.  They cook relatively quickly in the boiling water in front of you and flavor the water, creating a soup that you drink out of a soup bowl they bring out toward the end with salt and pepper on the bottom.We also shared some appetizers, which were also quite tasty, including the pork belly, duck, and eel omelet.There was a lot of food and I left perfectly satiated, and the ice cream at the end gave a nice sweet ending to the meal.
Jessica W.}San Francisco, CA}56}12}6}-1}3}10/19/2013}Ordered the prime ribeye Shabu Shabu aka "the best" Shabu meal selection- mediocre.  The meat was decent, the portions are tiny, but you do get a side of veggies and free ice cream dessert. I'd come here for the experience, instead. Staff is excellent- extremely attentive, and even helps you cook your food!
Tammy K.}New York, NY}69}207}19}18}4}10/18/2013}So I may have chosen the worst week ever to consume raw beef dipped in raw egg (government was shut down, and FDA had suspended food safety inspections), but it was totally worth it.Words cannot express how happy I was to finally find a restaurant in NYC that does sukiyaki right, as opposed to this precooked pot of meat silliness that I've encountered more often than I'd like.Get the sukiyaki dinner with the green tea ice cream dessert - so matcha tastiness in one meal!
Kalvin K.}Orlando, FL}451}1305}3129}18}5}10/10/2013}Absolutely amazing is all I can say about this restaurant. The food is stellar and the service is top notch. At the restaurant there are a few different methods of choice for meat preparation. There a couple of hot pot types and also the Japanese BBQ. Having never had Japanese BBQ, I was excited to try it. It's very similar to Korean BBQ but the meats are not marinated. Highly recommended restaurant. It's in a row of Japanese restaurants.
Julius B.}Manhattan, NY}181}36}5}-1}5}9/29/2013}I'm embarassed to say I  haven't reviewed this place yet and I'm here nearly every weekend. It's the best hot pot place in the city.  I've only been to one other one in Manhattan, but why try any other place when you've found the crown jewel. Definitely recommend the prime rib (the reg. beef is just not as good). Also a fan of the crab claw at times as an add on.This place offers a great salad to start,  a healthy array of veggies for hot pot and a complimentary dessert with the hot pot.  I recommend the green tea and red bean.Also, be sure to come with at least one other person but as I always say the more the merrier. I would really like to try their bbq as well, but I keep ordering the hot pot.They also now open for lunch on the weekends, which is a great value. Be sure to get here early for whichever meal as there always seems to be a line.  For weekend lunch get here by noon, for dinner--- 5pm if you don't want to eat too late. I've come here before several times at 7, 8 and 9 and its always 1.5 hours which I would wait for  but I'm just too hungry most of the times.  So, 5pm it is!
Jonathan Z.}Houston, TX}120}225}26}-1}5}9/2/2013}food:this is one of my favorite places to eat in new york. i have dreams about it and wake up craving iti had the shabu shabu dinner course with prime ribeye and ribeye. next time i'll just order 2 orders of prime ribeye - it's so freaking juicy and tastyit comes with rice, vegetables, and ice cream. perfectly portioned for 2 peoplecomfort:waited only 10 mins on a saturday night, table was spacious, romantic atmosphere for a date, and the bathroom is clean.
Kat Z.}Seattle, WA}225}72}11}-1}4}8/19/2013Updatedreview}Shaba tatsu has the one element that many NYC restaurants lack- consistency. Over the past two years and the many, many meals I've had here, the service has always been stellar, the food always high quality, and the ambiance always clean. Definitely eat here when you get a chance. Beware the long lines on weekends for dinner!
Julia M.}Watertown, MA}7}30}0}-1}4}7/27/2013}Went here for a surprise birthday party and it was great!  The food was delicious- my friends had never been to a place like this and were really into grilling their own food. As a vegetarian, the tofu bibimbap makes you feel like you're not missing out on anything being grilled. Perfect.
A W.}San Jose, CA}44}208}1078}-1}2}7/17/2013}We came here for lunch the other day and got premium beef shabu lunch special. Very standard beef and sauce, nothing special. Pricey for such mediocre lunch special.
Amy S.}Brooklyn, NY}100}485}124}-1}3}6/24/2013}haha honestly nothing beats shabu shabu i eat at home, but this place isn't too bad. The meat isn't bad, lots of veggies to put in as well. i guess i'm just spoiled with food at home, but overall it really isn't bad haha. i'm just being picky.
Shintaro H.}Manhattan, NY}220}106}40}-1}4}6/16/2013}Just like my mother's set up back in the day. It was an excellent experience. I didnt give it 5 stars because the wait was so long.
Siva S.}Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY}34}9}4}-1}5}6/7/2013}I am fat and nobody loves me.  Maybe it's because I had eating so much Shabu-Tatsu maybe because the servers were so kind to me I questioned my regular life of people who don't acknowledge me.  What is real and what is Shabu-Tatsu anymore.
Steph C.}Brooklyn, NY}468}752}318}18}4}6/7/2013}Love hotpot!  This is a good place to go occasionally, but it's much too expensive as a regular stop.The wait can get insane for dinnertime. The line just snakes outside the door, which can be extremely unpleasant during the wintertime when the door is propped open and the cold air whips in throughout the restaurant. I've done the wait and don't really think it's worth it.We ordered the prime rib-eye beef shabu shabu for two. It comes with rice, salad, vegetables, and dessert. The meat was fresh and of good quality, but portion size could have been bigger. Having had mostly hotpot in Chinatown places, I didn't realize that in this shabu shabu, the broth isn't really flavored and meant more as a base for cooking the meats and vegetables rather than making soup. You're supposed to use the dipping sauces for flavor. That was a little disappointing, since the soup is one of my favorite parts of hot pot.The rice, salad, and ice cream were all good and we enjoyed our meal. $26 a person for hotpot is quite a lot, considering places in Flushing are half that with more food. But I know, it's Manhattan, and the service/quality of food are better.
Stephen J.}Manhattan, NY}76}232}3804}18}3}6/4/2013}Don't even think about coming here during peak times otherwise the wait is just unreasonable.  Been coming here close to 14 years now - back in the day they had seating downstairs also, but now it is just a REALLY small place and the word that this place is pretty good is out there (thanks, Yelp) that it is pretty much overcrowded all the time.Quality of the food here is probably average to above-average, and IMHO has remained pretty consistent over the years.Go for the special, greasier/fattier cut of the meat.
Valerie L.}New York, NY}164}335}8}18}3}5/12/2013}Delicious shabu shabu, quick and efficient service. Expect long lines/waits because there are only ten tables at the restaurant...although the meats and vegetables were clean and fresh, I thought the quantity of meat and vegetables didn't justify the price of $24.99/person which includes rice, salad, and ice cream. (One plate of thinly sliced meat per person, one plate of vegetables between two people).  I think Shabu-Tatsu isn't really catered towards an Asian value-driven crowd and more for those who have never tried shabu-shabu. I have been to Japanese run shabu-shabu restaurants in both Toronto and San Francisco- both cities offer equal quality food and service and charge around half the price of Shabu-Tatsu. Don't get me wrong, the food was solid but pricey for what you get.
Lisa P.}San Francisco, CA}13}20}115}-1}2}5/9/2013}My friend and I love shabu shabu so we had to find a place during our viist in NYC.  Surprisingly there was not a lot of options.  Anyways, we yelped and found this spot.  I was bummed that they didn't have flavored broth.  I'm all about the broth because well, you cook the meat and vegetables it in.  It provides the base flavor. They brought us a pot of water, so really, everything was kinda bland.  I mean i added the paste provided at the table and the two sauces helped, but it was not the same shabu shabu experience I'm used to.
Jefferson M.}West New York, NJ}9}8}0}-1}4}5/7/2013}Pretty cozy spot, menu reflects most Shabu Shabu I've been to. It's a nice quiet place if you just want to sit back and talk over some good hot pot.
Alix C.}New York, NY}106}59}10}-1}3}4/24/2013}3.5 starsThe wait is so crazy long. They only have 10 tables or so so it gets pretty crowded quickly. We were told that we would need to wait about 45 minutes so we went to grab drinks at a nearby restaurant. The host told us to call in to get an update. When we called he said it was an additional 15 mins. We went back to the restaurant and he apologized and said they needed another 15 mins. The strange thing was that 2 groups that came after us were already crossed off his list, which means they got seated before us (and it wasn't an issue of party size). He offered to give us free drinks (since we already drank at another restaurant) but M asked for a discount on the bill instead. He seemed a bit reluctant.We ordered the beef shabu shabu and a mushroom bi bim bap. I don't feel like there was anything special about the shabu shabu and the two dipping sauces didn't taste great to me. The bi bim bap was super salty. There was so much soy sauce in it. When we got our bill surprisingly there was a 20% discount so I bumped it up half a star for customer service.
Joyce K.}Fullerton, CA}388}335}193}-1}4}4/18/2013}Lunch special every day until 3 Shabu shabu prime ribeye for 1 $16. Rice. Salad. Green tea icecream. Good deal. They also have some other lunch specials.  Shabu is good but so expensive in the city..i'm hittin the lunch special!!!
Connie T.}Manhattan, NY}2}17}12}-1}4}4/14/2013}Really good hotpot and very great services. Been here a few times. The traditional one, the soy-milk one (only for lunch) or the fried one with the special sauce (I forgot the name), they are all great. Since minimum order is 2, if you have 3 people, you can finish a portion for 2. The meal comes with white rice and noodles. Also, the green tea ice cream here is one of the best i've had: legit green tea, not the fake ones in other places.That said, for the price I paid I would want more meat. The line is insane for dinner, so try lunch time. Wish I have more variety of broth.
Salvatore C.}Manhattan, NY}118}108}230}-1}4}4/10/2013}Didn't get any shabu cuz it's kinda pricey. We got the bimbap and it's the best I've ever had, get it!
Jillie B.}New York, NY}18}71}17}-1}3}4/7/2013}I used to love coming here but now there is always an insane wait! I am tempted to buy my own pot and do Shabu at home!I agree, the food here is very expensive. And I am certain with their continued popularity that it won't get cheaper.That said, the food is good and the experience is worth it. If you have the patience.Maybe someday the hype will die down and I won't have to go eat Indian on 6th street instead.
Daphne L.}Toronto, Canada}27}163}77}-1}4}4/2/2013}First time in New York and one of my goals was to eat well... Eat Well I Did!Met with 2 old friends at Shabu Tatsu on a Friday dinner. It was an hour wait since they only take reservations for 4 or more people. They placed our name & number on the wait list and called us when a table was ready so we had pre-dinner drinks at a nearby pub.We had:- beef sukiyaki for 3My friend said to dip the cooked stuff in the bowl of raw egg... Whoa! That's different, but it added to the flavour and texture... So Good!- pork belly appetizerSurprisingly not too fatty and very soft, put some japanese mustard and it enhances the flavour even more- roasted duck appetizerThinly sliced and the scallions add to the flavourThe meal was a treat from my friend, so I'm not sure what the total came up to... I think it maybe about $50 per person, we also had sake.Service is fast and friendly, they start the cooking process of the sukiyaki for you.Good food and good company... Great Combination.
Carlin Y.}New York, NY}291}291}400}-1}4}3/27/2013}Came here on something like a Friday night around 11pm, looking for a place to eat. Not a big venue, and the line can get long for dinner if you don't make reservations ahead of time. Simple, but almost elegant decor, and a very friendly staff.Got the assorted seafood hot pot for $26 per person, although note that it's a minimum of 2 orders. The amount of meat / seafood that they provide is a decent amount actually, although not huge. The broth and noodles and veggies that come with the hotpot totally help make it worth it though. Delicious broth -- I'm a huge fan -- comes with udon noodles and napa cabbage and mushrooms and all sorts of other deliciousness that you can toss in there and let it marinade and soak up the broth. The broth has as savory-sweet taste to it, which is a refreshing twist to what you usually get in Chinese or Korean hotpot style food.Save some room for the really legit-tasting green tea and red bean icecream that comes with your meal! Definitely coming back sometime with more friends for the hotpot.
Wesley H.}Brooklyn, NY}15}295}0}-1}3}3/21/2013}A great shabu-shabu place! What I really liked about this place is that it had good bbq options as well. And some of the sides, such as the beef tartar, are very good! Overall, it was a positive experience both in terms of the quality of the food and the service. The only thing I think can be improved is having a wider variety of choices for the broth. Maybe I just didn't look at the menu carefully enough.
Jason H.}Manhattan, NY}11}105}0}-1}5}3/8/2013}I love this place. It's exactly what you would want from shabu shabu. We often go with a group of 5-8, and always with a reservation. It's often pretty full so make sure you call ahead (even a couple days). They also only have one large table in the corner that can comfortable accommodate 8+ (has 2 table stoves). But let's get to the food -- it's so good that we always order the same -- the prime meat. The meal comes with a small starter salad that has an amazing peanut dressing. I hate salad but it's like candy, so I enjoy it. Then the stove is turned on and everyone starts dropping in the vegetables (mushrooms, carrots, cabbage.. even tofu). Once the water soaks up the flavor we drop in the meat (high quality and A LOT of it). I've typically come with groups, but it's also a good date spot (food is great, with good company and a little teamwork on the cooking - pretty awesome.) The food is good and the act of helping make your meal is a nice addition for most of us cooking inept ny'ers. The meal finishes off with a scoop of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, red bean, green tea). Do your table a favor and get a pitcher of beer to help it all go down too.
S L.}San Francisco, CA}119}164}0}-1}4}3/4/2013}They only take reservations for 4 people or more, so definitely come here with a big group to avoid any wait time. We ordered Sukiyaki and Shabu-Shabu. I was a bigger fan of the Sukiyaki because of the sauce and thought that the Shabu-Shabu was a bit too plain - but still very good. We ordered beef, chicken and shrimp - the dishes come with noodles, vegetables, mushrooms and rice so it can definitely be pretty filling.We each only paid $36 with taxes and tip included.
Wendy C.}Walnut, CA}255}582}33}-1}2}2/22/2013}$60 for shabu shabu.. unheard of back at home.Shabu-tatsu is your standard Japanese shabu shabu restaurant.  They have your selection of veggies(napa cabbage, mushrooms, tofu, carrots, vermicelli.. etc) along with a bowl of white rice and the standard sesame and ponzu dipping sauces.   I ordered a beef plate while my boyfriend ordered the pork plate.  Neither one was particularly special.  The sauces that they serve here are not my favorite.  I didn't really like the sesame sauce as it had too much of a soy sauce flavor to it.  I definitely like my sauce more creamy and nutty in flavor.After your meal, the shabu shabu comes with a cup of ice cream with your selection of either vanilla, chocolate, green tea, or red bean.  The ice cream was decent.I dont see where the $60 price tag is justifiable in this equation.  Just standard quality meat, cheap veggies, and a pot of water.
Ad. C L.}New York, NY}63}78}42}-1}5}2/21/2013}Last Saturday I went to Shabu-Tatsu at 10pm and was told to wait for an hour to an hour and a half. I was very surprised because it was past regular dinner hours already, but I became determined to try it.So, I made a reservation on Tuesday for a party of four at 8:30pm Thursday. When my party arrived, we waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated, and then they became taking our orders and serving us right away. We ordered a 2 person prime beef Sukiyaki, a 2 person prime beef Shabu-Shabu and a Mochi Kinchaku (sticky rice cake wrapped in bean curd). They were all amazing! The Sukiyaki was very sweet (we were given a jar of Sukiyaki sauce and a jar of water so we can adjust the sweetness), and the beef slices that came with it were about 2mm thick. The Shabu-Shabu was just water, but it came with two sauces, I believe a plum sauce and a peanut sauce. The Shabu-Shabu beef slices were about 1mm thick and were really good Shabu-Shabu quality beef slices. I liked the Sukiyaki more than the Shabu-Shabu because the Shabu-Shabu did not have any flavor at all (just boiling in water), and I did not particularly like the two sauces. The Mochi Kinchaku took a while to cook (about 15 minutes), and had a very interesting texture to it. The bean curd was chewy and the sticky rice was well, sticky. However, I imagined the Mochi Kinchaku to be sweeter. Maybe I just had too many sweet mochi snacks.The restaurant has about 10 tables, but each table has a lot of space. I really enjoyed the food, the prompt and friendly service, and the chill atmosphere. My friends and I just stayed and ate till about 10pm before paying about $30 each. Great value, great experience, gonna come back again.Tip 1: Come on a weekday Tip 2: Come as a party of four and make reservation at least 2 days in advanceTip 3: Sukiyaki is better than the Shabu-Shabu if you like sweet taste and/or do not particularly like plum sauce and peanut sauce
Susie L.}New York, NY}10}28}1}-1}4}2/17/2013}We were so glad to find this place tonight, as it was freeeeezing.  I had initially tried to make a reservation at Momokawa but they said that we would have to leave our table by 8:00, so we opted for this place.  The soup base consists simply of a piece of seaweed (dashima) in a single pot of boiling water, and you add veggies and the meat.  A lot of the flavor came from the slices of prime rib eye that we ordered.  The sauces were a light peanut one and a dark one (some kind of soy sauce & hoisin(?) concoctio) - both were pretty good.  The service was great, too - they didn't rush us, didn't check in on us too frequently.  The meal ended with a scoop of green tea ice cream - a perfect ending to the perfect meal for a cold evening.
Stace C.}New York, NY}586}302}1944}-1}4}2/12/2013}There is always a line here especially during the winter.  Avoid by coming earlier during the night around 6pm.  Their premium beef is soft and delicious and is accompanied by a plate of veggies.  Try their bimbimbap! The meal ends with an ice cream for dessert. Tip: Make reservations for parties of 4 or more.
Alli H.}New York, NY}173}595}53}-1}4}1/25/2013}This was round two of my friend date for shabu shabu.Shabu Tatsu was much more fun and a better experience than Momokawa because the hot water was in the table and not on the side.The food isn't of as good a quality as Momokawa but it was more bang for your buck.Apparently the lines get really long here but we were not busy when we got there. When we left, there was a ton of people waiting outside.I would come back, it was tasty.
Jane W.}Manhattan, NY}7}7}0}-1}5}1/14/2013}I have been to this restaurant more then once and I was never disappointed. The food is great and the service as well.We had the rib eye and shrimp which was great. Also, surprisingly the vegetable dumplings were delicious (although not too appealing as i have never tried green dumplings).And for dessert, you must try the green tea ice cream. It's creamy and has a strong kick to it, but all the more reason to love it!
S S.}Brooklyn, NY}27}288}912}-1}3}1/4/2013}Tried their Shabu-Shabu A (Beef) and D (Pork). Shabu-Shabu is similar to HotPot. The only diff is that Shabu-Shabu cook in a pot of tasteless boiling water. Somehow, I found this cooking method more healthier then HotPot. I will be happy to go back to this place for Shabu-Shabu.
Dominic L.}Westbury, NY}14}86}271}-1}4}1/1/2013}This is one of the best places for shabu shabu.  Order the prime beef.  Leaves with your mouth watering
Jaimee A.}Manhattan, NY}2242}1556}643}18}4}1/1/2013}SImply AMAZING!!We were first introduced to Shabu Shabu at Masa, so we were excited to try it again in a more traditional (inexpensive) setting. This restaurant is tiny and super cozy. The staff was friendly and accommodating to my hubby, me and our young daughters. We had two orders of the prime rib shabu shabu, the chicken shabu-shabu, dumplings and some Korean bbq for the girls. All was delicious. The girls loved the soup after the meal. Their cocktails were also wonderful.We will definitely come back!
Susy C.}San Francisco, CA}701}1730}1209}18}4}11/28/2012}I'm a shabu snob. I won't hide that fact.Shabu-Tatsu has fairly decent meat, bordering on the higher quality side.No AYCE (Yes, I'm a fattycakes that loves AYCE shabu because I can eat for hours) but they charge by plate. Liked that they offer a variety of other dishes on the menu.Along with all of our yummy meat, we decided to order calf liver sashimi and yukhwe (beef tartare) Isn't that Korean? Is this place Korean owned?I've had a fair amount of beef tartare in my life. Korean beef tartare? Been there, done that. While Shabu-Tatsu's wasn't anything impressive, the calf liver sashimi was definitely interesting.The calf liver sashimi comes beautifully sliced with a side of sesame oil, minced garlic, salt. I tried the liver sashimi in a small dab of sesame oil with a tiny bit of salt. Didn't like it that way. The sesame overpowered everything. The calf liver sashimi is a bit gamey (duh, it's liver) but it's crazy delicious with just a small sprinkling of salt, pepper and a tiny bit of the minced garlic. Service is pretty much impeccable. They came around periodically to skim the fat out of our broth and remembered to make the "tea" out of our broth at the end. So comforting and crazy yummy.Make a reservation though. The line and wait can be bananas.
Roberto F.}Manhattan, NY}1}39}0}-1}4}11/24/2012}We had the shabu shabu and it was really good. Good quality meats and vegetables. Sauces were good. I would order appetizers because the portions are on the smaller side, especially the meats for the soup. Would go back.
Navin W.}Los Angeles, CA}219}105}445}-1}3}11/24/2012}HIGHLIGHTS:PORK BELLY APPETIZERBIBIMBAPOK:Prime Beef ShabuMy New York friends know me as a shabu connoisseur (or would that be, shabu addict?) so on a recent visit, we ate here.  It started to get busier around 8, so I'm glad we were early and had a reservation.The prime beef shabu was decent - our table of 6 shared one hot pot to cook everything in.  My shabu spots on the west coast are one hot pot per person, but I do appreciate that we are at one table, sharing, it becomes a more social experience that way.  There was no shortage of veggies.  The goma (sesame) sauce was good, the quality of the meat was solid, but I wasn't blown away.
Elsa Y.}Manhattan, NY}265}149}19}-1}4}11/17/2012}The place is a bit small so I recommend to go with a smaller group. I had a group of 10 and it was hard to talk across the table. We had the shabu shabu and it came with a lot of veggie. The food is delicious. I would totally come back!
Ara K.}Staten Island, NY}41}20}100}-1}1}11/17/2012}Now I know why everybody come here for hot pot not sukiyaki, why? because the only thing they hv good are beef ... Good beef wont taste bad after boiled in the pot I guess... and also, i believe they dont really know how to serve sukiyaki... they actually use onion and veggie without butter to heat up the pan,.. WTH?! The worst sukiyaki I ever ate,
Sandy J.}Alexandria, VA}247}259}300}-1}3}11/6/2012}When it comes to shabu shabu in NYC, there are slim pick-in's.  When I first moved to NYC, this was the only place I went to and knew of for shabu shabu.  The shabu shabu here is good and would satisfy my cravings, but I've had better.   Furthermore, for the portions they serve it is overpriced.If you're in the area and craving shabu shabu, by all means drop by.  However, since this is the only shabu shabu restaurant in the area, on a busy night, the wait can be an hour or more long.I hate to say this and would love to keep this a secret, but if you want quality and delicious shabu shabu/Japanese hot pot I have found a few ideal spots.  Since it's NYC though, secrets don't stay secrets long and you should definitely make reservations for the following:-Hakata Ton Tonyelp.com/biz/hakata-tont…-Momokawayelp.com/biz/momokawa-ne…
Will S.}Chicago, IL}0}501}1}-1}3}11/5/2012}I was very disappointed by the food. I'm only giving them a 3 because they were very nice from a service perspective. I Stopped here for lunch and got sushi rolls, Tuna and some sort of salmon concoction the bartender recommended. The tuna was fine not great. The salmon was inedible. My salad side salad was good with an excellent ginger/carrot dressing. Tab before tax/tip was only $12 but I would have rather paid more for a better meal.. I'd be willing to give it another chance because of the low price and generally good reviews on Yelp. But next time, I'll stick to the basic rolls and skip the house recommendation
Marian J.}Manhattan, NY}0}23}1}-1}3}10/22/2012}Staff was friendly and helpful...we were seated immediately even without a reservation and just in time too...the dinner crowd started coming in after we got settled into our comfortable albeit cramped booth.  Ordered the seafood grill...for the price ($52 for 2) we expected more food but the selection and quality of food was good.  If the price was more reasonable or the portions bigger I would give this place a higher rating.  As it is, it was just okay.
Lilly Y.}Long Island, NY}1}36}84}-1}3}10/21/2012}Nice place to eat. We ordered shabu shabu for two, but the soup is very plain just like hot water. The meat was good tho.
Wendy G.}Minato, Japan}238}721}1145}18}4}10/20/2012}Want to have hot pot that warms you up on a cold  or rainy day, but doesn't overly stimulate your taste bud?Try the Japanese shabu-shabu! It's clean and it's nutritious!  As a Japanese hot pot specialty shop, they've got a relatively simple menu. However, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, due to the outstanding service, cozy ambiance, and the unexpected bonus-  green tea icecream at the end as the finish. One thing to note, when you make the choice of types to combine for the shabu-shabu, order beef or chicken/pork... Avoid the shrimps- their shrimp simply fell short, way too petite and taste bland (might be frozen? I don't know).
Penny Y.}Brooklyn, NY}0}14}5}-1}4}10/14/2012}Pretty good food. Not too many choices for lunch special but a lot of options on the regular menu and appetizers. Place is small but clean and comfortable. Ordered the shabu shabu lunch special with the beef and it comes with salad, rice and ice cream plus a complimentary plate of veggies and noodles.
Joyce L.}Brooklyn, NY}25}241}310}-1}4}10/13/2012}I have been wanting to come here for a very long time but every time I am in the area the place is always packed. So today we planned to come here right when it opened so that we could get seats. We ordered the prime rib-eye and rib-eye shabu shabu as well as the salmon teriyaki. The salmon teriyaki was fabulous! There was still come skin left which was pan fried till crispy and the salmon was moist and juicy inside. It went really well with the teriyaki sauce which was not as thick and sweet as other places like to make it. The shabu shabu was not what I had expected since I am used to chinese hotpot so I thought there would be a flavorful soup base but it turned out to only be water. Here's a tip: pay $2 more for the prime-rib eye instead because the rib-eye was definitely not that great. The meat did not come in whole slices but rather, torn up slices. The portions of the beef might not be that filling since they are rather thin. Overall, I really enjoyed my shabu shabu experience here. The staff was very polite and helpful and came over to scoop out the oil from the pot from time to time. The quality of this place is pretty good though I wish the portions were a bit bigger since they are charging a good amount per person. The sesame dipping sauce is really good and I wish they would have given more! I think they charge you extra if you need more so the entire time I was trying to ration the sauce so I could last until the end of the meal. I would certainly come back, though maybe at lunchtime since the prices are about $10 cheaper.
Ryna D.}New York, NY}209}1413}2113}18}5}10/11/2012Updatedreview}Those looking for a more casual and homey yakiniku restaurant, however, should head to the East Village and go to Shabu-Tatsu. This small restaurant has been around since 1991 and specializes in yakiniku, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki, all of which are traditional family meals in Japan. And while the yakiniku here isn't dressed up for the New York Times crowd like Takashi is, the quality is good and the price point is excellent. This is the place you go to when you're comfortable with yakiniku and you neither require the doting attention at Gyu-kaku nor the fancy introduction at Takashi. Bring a small group, take advantage of the combination dinners, and enjoy. Come often enough and you'll be used to the idea of cooking your own food that you'll even be moved to try shabu-shabu. Check out my Examiner article for a guide to yakiniku in NY!
Tiffany T.}Los Angeles, CA}117}203}10}-1}4}9/25/2012}I always have a consistently solid meal here. The beef is good quality. The veggies and sauce are traditional standard and fresh. I also like the beef tartare and bibimbap as appetizers. Yummy!
Naijia H.}Manhattan, NY}20}90}0}-1}4}9/23/2012}Great genuine ShabuShabu and Nabe with lots of veggies!  Meat is a bit pricey but the quality is good and the service is amazing.  Go with the prime rib or pork.  At the end, we got ice cream and tea - a nice surprise.
Anita C.}Seattle, WA}928}209}260}-1}3}9/22/2012}3.5 stars. I desperately wanted to like Shabu Tatsu, as I adore shabu shabu and there aren't any shabu options in the DC area where I live. My friend and I ordered the $26 prime rib-eye shabu option (minimum 2 orders). It came with a large plate of meat, silken tofu, carrots, napa cabbage, green onions, mushrooms, and noodles. My first thought upon seeing the portion sizes was that it was smaller than other places I've been to. While they do give you complimentary tea and green tea ice cream, I was still left feeling a little bit hungry at the end. They provide two sauces - a soy/ponzu sauce, and a sesame oil peanut sauce. I don't usually like peanut sauce, and I found the ponzu sauce lacking - it didn't taste quite like ponzu, even though the servers insisted it was.One of my biggest gripes about the shabu here is that there weren't any broth options - it's just plain, boiling water. I've had broth options including spicy miso (my favorite!) and chicken broth in the past, so the flavoring of the soup was rather bland.The complimentary green tea ice cream at the end was very tasty - sometimes when green tea ice cream has been stored too long, it tastes soapy. This one was a great refresher at the end. The service here was great. The servers were really attentive and they were quick to clear any plates and residual mess. Since there aren't too many shabu shabu options in Manhattan, I would recommend coming here if you are craving it, but it's definitely not the best shabu I've ever had.
Jimmy K.}Sugar Land, TX}13}11}15}-1}1}9/13/2012}Definitely over priced and over rated. I've had much better shabu! Once is plently for me.
Diana Z.}River Vale, NJ}283}121}0}-1}3}9/4/2012}Came here on Sunday with a group of 8.  The place is not large but seems to work well enough. The only issue is that we sat at a table where essentially we were all facing the same direction. I understand it was set up this way so that the waiters could place the hot pots on the table without going through any of us but it made for difficult conversation. So that was already a big issue for us, that we couldn't all sit around and talk. There were two burners and we all wanted to get to try different things so we ordered one hot pot that is like a soup already filled with vegetables and noodles where you just add the meal/fish, and another that was just plain boiling water where you dump the veggies, proteins, and noodles in yourself. Unfortunately, the way we were set up, one end of the table basically had one of the kinds of burners and the other side had the other.It took some time to understand how ordering would work - the menu isn't very clear when it comes to how to order for a large group looking to do hot pot. Once we figured it out though, we were happier. The food was good and everything was well cut and presented so we could very easily cook the food. Definitely no complaints in the food department.The only other thing that was sort of bad was the lack of vents. Basically one side of the table was constantly hit with steam from the hot pot because of the lack of ventilation. So basically the set up of the restaurant was the main problem. The food was not a problem.We got ice cream at the end. That was awesome.
Priscilla T.}Manhattan, NY}104}580}8}18}3}8/28/2012}3.5 stars to be precise. It would have been 4 but this place has no broth options and everything interactive has a minimum 2 person order which is annoying. Otherwise, the meat quality is good, the veggie and noodle portions are generous, and the service is friendly! The great thing is that you can also do yakiniku if you'd rather grill.$26 for prime ribeye, noodles, veggies, rice, and ice cream is decent value as well. It's no Shabu Shabu SF but it will do. Tip: get the gyoza! Thin crispy skin and great dipping sauce.
Ally W.}Manhattan, NY}23}70}13}-1}3}8/25/2012}I love Shabu Shabu. It is a fun way of sharing food with friends - I enjoy cooking the food while having conversation with people. Moved from San Francisco, I was looking for a place in the City where you can get decent Shabu Shabu. My Japanese hairdresser recommended Shabu Tatsu to me. I decided to give this place a try after reading all the good reviews on Yelp. I made a reservation for a party of four for dinner. This place doesn't give you your own pot, the four of us had to share the same pot . The food is fresh and the service is good, but quite pricey given the small portion. Also, I didn't like the dipping sauce that much. The overall experience is good but I think it is over-priced. Maybe I will try this place for lunch next time as the lunch is supposed to be cheaper.
Lucy C.}New York, NY}131}1173}43}18}3}8/12/2012}Definitely over-hyped, but still enjoyable. I got the rib eye shabu during lunch for $16. The policy is that you must order at least 2 of the same flavored shabus per table. My friend and I were there right when it opened so we were served immediately. The meat was sliced very thin and cooked in about 10 seconds. The vegetables were very fresh, as well as the salad with ginger dressing. I absolutely loved the sesame sauce. It was extremely flavorful, creamy, and complimented everything perfectly. The other sauce was sour and I did not care for it. It also comes with rice. The green tea ice cream was good. Overall, I thought it was a bit over priced, especially the appetizers. There was no real ambiance, just white walls and wooden tables.
Ah-Hyun C.}New York, NY}32}105}1}-1}4}8/11/2012}Really enjoyed getting some good shabu shabu here with friends. We made a reservation for 4 on a Wed night and had a ten minute wait, which isn't bad considering the size of this place. It's not exactly a hole in the wall but nearly is. It's surprisingly difficult to find a great shabu place, probably because since each ingredient is pretty much preserved in its natural state (aside from being boiled), the quality of each said ingredient is extremely important. This place definitely provided fresh produce and meat and overall, it was a clean-tasting, surprisingly filling experience. Word to the wise - don't put the noodles in in the beginning. After you're fishing all the other veggies and meat out, they put the noodles in for you to the pot and add some sauce. Their green tea ice cream was also incredibly light and delicious, totally worth it to go back just for the ice cream!
Clemens W.}New York, NY}448}235}596}-1}4}8/9/2012}Just came here for dinner and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Well - it was raw and I had to cook it myself, but given the raw ingridients, I'd consider it up there. The service was extremely polite and attentive, but I would suggest that they give some of those thin, slimy and crunchy mushrooms.  The portions also looked a bit off, but we weren't able to eat anymore after finishing.i actually like the places that have the individual shabbu shabbu pots, but the Japanese style is one with delibiration and a homely sharing quality to it.Remember that the little laddel with the small bowl of water is for you to skim off the top layer of fat.  Also remember that the ribeye beef of high quality will probably be good and edible after 5 seconds in the boiling water.  Chicken and noodles require a bit longer.
Jermaine A.}Manhattan, NY}631}51}2}-1}4}7/22/2012}i'm a big Shabu-Tatsu fan, the service is good they treat this puerto rican guy so good! lol and the food is top notch. I'm definitely coming back !
Helen X.}Manhattan, NY}2}25}0}-1}4}6/25/2012}1. reasonable price for lunch. a little pricey for dinner. portion is reasonable. not generous, not small. 2. green tea ice-cream is really good.
Jessie C.}Manhattan, NY}17}5}1}-1}4}6/17/2012}Great good and value for money! Loved the place so much that I went twice in just 2 weeks! There aren't too many shabu shabu places in NYC so I am glad I found this one! I rarely write (actually, this is my first one) on Yelp but I felt this place definitely deserved a few words from a satisfied customer. Both times, I had the premium beef shabu shabu menu and both times, I walked out wanting to unbutton my jeans. Get the premium beef, it is only $2 more than the normal beef. Part of the menu includes a generous serving of fresh vegetables/tofu and 2 types of noodles. The peanut sauce they give you on the side is amazing, as is the green tea ice cream they give you at the end.Service is excellent. Not too loud inside (a lot quieter on the bottom level). I would give this place 4.5 stars overall.It gets pretty busy on the weekends, we waited 45 minutes during peak time on a Saturday but walked straight in during dinner time on a weeknight.Totally recommend this place! This will definitely become a regular spot for me when I feel like warming myself up with some shabu shabu!
Pamela L.}New York, NY}12}175}131}-1}3}6/15/2012}I've walked by this place so many times and always see people waiting outside for seats. My girlfriend and I decided to try it out to see what all the hype was about. It's not a big restaurant, there are ~15-20 tables. We got here at 6:30pm and no wait for us, hooray!! I noticed that the line started shortly after we were seated though.We looked around to see what other people ordered and opted for the Prime rib-eye dinner - looks like that was the most popular dish. It comes with assorted vegetables which we both liked. We also had ice cream as desserts. The food was fresh and we enjoyed our meal. This place is cute and I guess there are not a lot of good shabu-shabu joints in the neighborhood, hence it's a hot spot - especially when it's cold out. My friend and I both felt that it's a tad overpriced, as we can go to Chinese hot pot for the same price with more food varieties. I may come back again if invited with friends to go.
Chi-Chi S.}Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA}20}61}14}-1}2}6/14/2012}over, over, overpriced. totally no idea why this place is rated so high on yelp. and the hot sauce is actually pretty sweet. even the chili powder...u call that spicy? even red brick powder is spicier!
Natalie C.}Scottsdale, AZ}132}136}72}-1}4}5/22/2012}I loved this place, but when I came here with Singaporeans who lived in Japan, they pointed all the things they were lacking. So I guess they helped out a bunch in this review. They don't serve tea at all when you eat, and every good Asian food place should offer tea at the start of your meal. It wouldn't have bothered me, but when your spending a lot for dinner, you would expect at LEAST tea! The food I though was great! The Singaporeans, yea it's good, but not GREAT. Then again, I think the first time I came here, the food we ordered was better. This last time we had seafood sukiyaki. The first time was the beef shabu shabu. Also, the green tea ice cream was much better the first time I came last year, but now it was not great. I can get much better ones from the carton at Mitsuwa. Is this trend?!?! I hope it's not, because the first time I came it was awesome! The second time I came, less than a year later, not so amazing. But I'm hopeful!
Sunny D.}Los Angeles, CA}160}245}378}-1}4}5/16/2012}Did you know "real" shabu broth contains only water and yelp, I mean kelp? I enjoy flavored broths like tonkatsu, kimchi, chinese herb, miso and found that NYC doesn't have these readily available. Why? I suppose to hold up to tradition but f*ck tradition! It's 2012! Get some flavored broth already! That came from a dark place. However, Shabu Tatsu left me happy and pretty satisfied sans flavored broth.Get the highest quality beef and lamb with your shabu. They give you what seems like an endless amount of vegetables minus corn. Leave the mushrooms in the pot the longest but be careful when eating them because they'll taste like burning if you eat them right away. The prices are standard for shabu but be ready to wait on Friday and Saturday nights. We waited about 2 hours for a table for 2 but I put my name down and walked over to Angel's Share for a few cocktails. Every now and again I called in to see if the table was ready and the host was super nice every time I rang. Even when I called in for the 10th time, he was still really polite. Thanks, host man.There's a few tables downstairs too, so, if you want some privacy request those. They accept CC and you'll most likely have to use it unless you like carrying loads of cash in your wallet. If this is you, call me.
Carol N.}New York, NY}37}10}0}-1}5}5/3/2012}Awesome as usual! Consistent and great, fresh food for years...you see it raw and cook it yourself! This is as good as it gets. And they are also very accommodating to my parents who are both handicapped. Food is always great, service is awesome! I would not recommend going without a reservation and also with parties over 6. Best is a party of 4. Get the Combo A and kurobuta sausage app, you will be happy and full!
Tutti C.}San Francisco, CA}54}30}3}-1}5}4/18/2012}Service is fantastic here they deserve a 5 star. Oh and also the ice cream does too. other than that it was aiteeee...I've honestly have had better shabu, the soy sauce tasted a bit funky but this place is still good. I would recommend for sure!you better get that red bean ice cream!
J L.}New Paltz, NY}33}51}66}-1}4}4/18/2012}It's always a treat eating Shabu Shabu, with a friend or many friends.  A great place to take out of town friends or foes, if you've never tried shabu shabu it's a must.  It can get a bit pricey if you're extremely hungry and have a few mouths to feed, but you wont find many other places like it.  Order the big dishes first, then extra sides.  The host needs some better training, seems like there's always a long wait and tables open, try to avoid going on the weekends.  Fun for kids, they'll love the complimentary green tea, vanilla, and red bean ice cream.
avani a.}New York, NY}10}16}0}-1}4}4/15/2012}The sirloin beef is tops and the bibimbap is actually hot and served right.I agree with all the positive reviews and don't need to be overly redundant.  Go to here.
Sonny C.}New York, NY}0}94}2}-1}5}3/29/2012}no bs, straight quality and delicious authentic shabu! there's plenty of chinese takes of shabu all over NY, but if you want the Japanese original, go here! you won't be disappointed!
Charle M.}Los Angeles, CA}450}209}7}-1}4}3/27/2012}As a general rule regarding restaurants, I like to eat somewhere at least twice before I write a review about it. Because, you know, I want to know what the hell it is I'm talking about before I spew forth knowledge on the subject. With Shabu-Tatsu I can guarantee you that I know what the hell it is I'm talking about. I have been here a couple of times and every one of them was enjoyable. The meal was great, the sauces were great, the little bowl of ice cream you get for dessert is great. In all honesty, this is one of my favorite places to eat out when I want a filling sit-down meal somewhere nearby that doesn't require high heels.I'm not going to get in to what shabu-shabu is because the other reviewers have done enough regarding the subject of what swish swishing is and where it comes from. What's important to know is that you don't have to dress up here, just try to look presentable. It's good for small groups or for dates as it's not too fancy and the prices aren't overwhelming. They take credit cards but I don't believe they take reservations (maybe call ahead to make sure I'm right about this). It's small and there aren't a lot of tables so be prepared to wait on the weekends.Now, in regards to a few dissenters down there: maybe there is better shabu-shabu across the Pacific but really, a higher quality cow slaughter does not warrant international airfare. And yes, there are self-declared "foodies" who get snooty on the subject of taste and authenticity but really, I lived in Tokyo as a freelance bar and food writer for well over a year. You should trust my opinion of Shabu-Tatsu based on that alone. It's good. You should go there.
Peter D.}Brooklyn, NY}4389}2810}7013}18}4}3/23/2012}There isn't much better than swishing high-quality beef about in a hot-pot filled with stock of your own creation, dunking it in delicious dipping sauces and then stuffing it into your face. And that's why you go to Shabu-Tatsu. The set dinners are a good value, as you get soup, salad, beef (if you know what's good for you), all the veggies you need and even dessert. I always want a bit more meat, but don't we all?Now, some uncultured buffoons may not appreciate you bringing them to a place where they have to cook their own food. Stop being friends with these ungrateful hacks immediately. They obviously don't like fun, and nor do they appreciate the fact that we are now so privileged that we pay restaurants for the right to prepare our own meal. Tell them to get with the times, right before you flatulate and walk away from them forever.
John J.}Lakewood, CA}146}33}7}-1}1}3/13/2012}Although the food looks good, I am bummed this place has a two order minimum.  I am a Shabu fan, but it doesn't work for single travelers.
Ming T.}MASPETH, NY}59}6}0}-1}1}3/10/2012}If you don't take reservation on weekends or at all, please tell people up front.  Don't send conflicting messages over the phone, "Oh, please call back on the day."  "Oh, please call back in the evening if you are coming in the evening."  "Oh, we are all booked, but call when you are on the way."  "Oh, we can't put your name down over the phone."  When you are actually there, the waiter just does not care if you are waiting outside in the cold and does not even bother asking your name or number or letting you know how long it might be.Waited more 1.5 hours just to get a table.  If you are a group larger than 4, please do not bother on a weekend.  It's just a shame when you have to be so disappointed even before your dinner starts.  By the time I sat down, my appetite had long gone.  Who cared how the food tasted at that point.
Sally C.}Manhattan, NY}91}12}4}-1}5}3/4/2012}This is my favorite place in NYC. I've been to many shabu shabu places but nothing compares to Shabu Tatsu.(altho momokawa has better meat quality by 2%). Best quality meat + Best Service + Best everything. Their portion is just right and people who works their are very helpful and friendly. Must try their green tea ice cream for dessert with yebisu :)
Pam S.}Brooklyn, NY}186}412}399}-1}5}3/4/2012}There is no reason to go any place else for high quality Japanese shabu shabu. Get the sirloin beef set, and you'll be all set to conquer the world/ that video game/ your foozeball opponent/ that mosh pit at the concert of that band/ a phonecall with your grandma. Whatever it is, this is all the fuel you need.Don't forget to ask for fresh garlic to add to the dipping sauce. And the spicy plum paste thing that is already on the table adds a nice tangy touch. You also get yummy red bean ice cream with the set.
Kelly C.}Marlton, NJ}254}379}593}18}4}2/28/2012}a great find in the city! reasonable price for a fabulous amount of food! the meal includes a salad for starter, your choice or shabu shabu, sukiyaki or bbq AND THEN ice cream! for $26? Where are you going to get that in the city? it's a steal~  I was super excited for dinner and it did not disappoint.  presentation was great, the food was great and ice cream was icy cold = A plus! I will say that even though it is prime rib eye... it cannot compare to wagyu beef... it's sad that they don't have that but for shabu shabu or sukiyaki, wagyu is definitely the best choice.   So that's where it loses points on... other than that, service was great, very helpful, i like it when servers do not interrupt the conversation and just do what needed to be done.  we also got our table in a timely manner, right on schedule so good organization on their part.i would definitely like to come back! note: always make a reservation!
Mike O.}Brooklyn, NY}209}1722}570}-1}3}2/26/2012}Very nice for a lark. I would visit here again. I like the idea of cooking your own raw meat immediately. I'm no novice to chop sticks, but my hand cramped up a bit after holding meet over boiling water. The steam is also very hot to the hand. The meat is delicious, the veggies are, too. The dipping sauces are delectable. I don't mind the communal aspect of the meal, either. Yet still, I can't view this place as anything other than a lark: somewhere you take a friend to show how intriguing or varied your palate is.
Jason C.}Rockville, MD}333}493}671}18}4}2/26/2012}Shabu Tatsu (more or less) is a Japanese style shabu shabu restaurant.  Shabu shabu is a Japanese dish so what does that supposed to mean?Traditional shabu shabu does not use broth or any flavorings.  The meat and vegetables are cooked in boiling water with kombu (kelp).  This is quite different from Korean style or Chinese style shabu shabu where a meat based broth is used to add flavor to the dish.With traditional style shabu-shabu, you can't really get too creative.  Basically, the make it or break it points of a shabu shabu meal are:1) quality of the meat-obviously2) sauces-b/c there is no base and everything is cooked in water and kombu.We ordered prime rib eye shabu shabu.  It was moderate quality meat that was sliced razor thin and came with a nice mix of vegetables, tofu, and noodles. Basically you get the whole package (plus mochi/ice cream) without having to order anything else on the side ala carte for $26 which I felt was extremely reasonable for a shabu shabu meal in Manhattan.The vegetable sauce which is soy sauce based and the peanut based sauce for the meat were very similar or 1/2 a notch higher in quality to the prepackaged shabu shabu sauces found in Asian grocery stores.   Shabu-tatsu failed to deliver on distinguishing sauces that would have separated it from the average shabu shabu restaurants I have been to in the past.On a final note, the wait times can get long b/c there are only 8 tables in the restaurant (you may have to share tables).  To skip the long lines, I suggest you come right when the restaurant opens and you'll be able to get a seat without a reservation and skip the long and atrocious 1hr lines.4* for the value and great service.  3.5* for the food.
Sarah R.}Manhattan, NY}150}54}9}-1}5}2/24/2012}I crave Shabu at least once a week after I was introduced to it in SF (i will always compare shabu to The Shabu House in sf). I moved here a few months ago and could not wait to try it. A little pricier than SF ($24 for beef, $26 for rib-eye) but I did my research and it's the cheapest in the city. First visit my mouth was watering before I was even seated. I was so disappointed to find there are no flavored broth's (spicy miso, carrot ginger like in SF), but instead just plain old water. So disappointed, but it still was wonderful as I added tons of stuff to the water to make it look more interesting. Come to find out water is the traditional way (so no stars deducted) , and the shabu in SF is simply a San Francisco treat. Come here for lunch on Sat and Sun to get shabu for only $18!!!! Although it's no SF it is delicious!
H T.}Manhattan, NY}0}254}5}-1}5}2/19/2012}I love this place more then any other food EVER.. no joke. it is SO good! The goma is thebest ive ever had. I LOVE shabu TATSU!
H H.}Dublin, CA}69}457}124}-1}4}2/17/2012}I didn't realize how small the place was, there was about 9 tables.  But you can make reservations and not wait.My friends and I got the shabu beef orders. The meat was really good and the sauces made it taste even better.  I wish they gave us more meat and less cabbage. The service was very catering and the place is  clean.  Great place to bring a small group of friends!Legit considering the area.
Jia Z.}Queens, NY}79}206}116}-1}4}2/5/2012}Be prepared to have about forty minutes' wait if you fail to make a reservation. It happened to me every time and it could be a pain on a cold winter night since there's no waiting area in the restaurant. Once you are seated, however, the service is prompt and attentive. The prime beef rib is the staple and you can order other stuff as you wish. It lives up to the expectation of good shabu-shabu, and that's why people like me keep coming back.
Jess W.}Stockton, CA}420}30}1}-1}5}2/4/2012}This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside it's adorable. The tables are set up so everyone can easily talk and use the 'cooker' in the middle of the table. I love the idea of making your own food, it's such a social experience and everything tastes absolutely delicious. The prime rib-eye is so tender it literally melts in your mouth. Everything tastes so fresh and clean and I found myself full without feeling disgusting afterward. It's a little on the pricey side, but worth what you'll pay!
Mark L.}Manhattan, NY}19}13}33}-1}4}1/30/2012}I've been wanting to try this place for some time. The only barrier has been the wait. This place isn't huge so it's gets packed fast, so either get there early or be prepared to wait outside. Now, onto the food. Overall, I give the food, service and experience two thumbs up. I went there on a rainy Thursday evening with my brother, so we sat down immediately. We ordered sake and Sapporo and a few appetizers - pork belly and calf liver sashimi - which were unbelievably good.  For our entre, we ordered Yakiniku (assorted seafood & meat BBQ combo) for two. The seafood and meat were so fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this! Plus for those who don't know much about cooking, the servers frequent your table to check in and help cook. Very good service! I don't want this place to be more busy than it already is, but Shabu-Tatsu is a must!
Alina G.}New York, NY}202}108}26}-1}3}1/18/2012}I was actually really disappointed with this place. I was recommended to go by a friend that raved about it...so maybe it was because I was expecting a lot, but in any case, the food just did not deliver. Walking in, I suddenly realized the restaurant is a ton smaller than I imagined it to be. There are about 8 tables total. I was seated right away since it was a Tuesday evening. My friend and I decided to order from the Shabu Shabu dinner course menu. Its a minimum of 2 orders. We got one of prime rib-eye beef and one pork. It comes with hordes more vegetables than you would like.The waitress comes by and turns on the water to boil and you take it from there. Thankfully, my friend is Japanese and knows how to do everything otherwise I would have been confused (though it turns out its extremely simple; you just stick the veggies in first for 5-10 minutes and dip the meat in for a few seconds.)Onto the food. I wasn't impressed with the meat. True, the beef was pretty decent, and one of the sauces it comes with is amazing but regardless, it was pretty bland. The vegetables were even worse, I could barely get them down. I found myself mainly eating rice as a result. Prices are reasonable, except that the Yakitori dinner course options ran from $52-$56 per person. I thought that was ridiculous. The shabu shabu is about $25 per person. The best part about the meal was the ice cream it came with! A choice of green tea, red bean, and vanilla. Get the red bean if you know whats good for you.So, sadly....this is what it comes down to. I give it 3 stars because the waiters were nice and because I didn't give the entire menu a hit so there is still hope. For the time being, I can say that the shabu shabu is just not worth it.
Juliet K.}Arlington, VA}269}500}56}18}4}1/16/2012}made a reservation and they had a table waiting for us. it was interesting to have japanese style shabu shabu instead of chinese hot pot which is what i am normally used to. the broth was a bit more salty but it was still delicious. I also liked that you didnt have to order each vegetable separately as you do in DC. we ordered: apps -  pork kakuni - pork belly. very delicious if you like pork belly               okonomiyaki - japanese pork pancake. wasnt a huge fan of this. textures were a bit strange to me.               assorted kimchi - the cucumber one really sucked. it wasnt spicy at all. the other two were pretty good though - cabbage and radish kimchi. beef bibimbap - the crispyness of the rice from the hot stone pot made this totally worth it. definitely need to add the red pepper paste sitting on the table to give it the extra kick it needs sukiyaki. we ordered this for only 2 people, but it was more than enough food the 4 of us with the other dish and app we ordered. small place so just be sure to make a reservation because eating shabu shabu can take awhile and i dont know if waiting in a long line is worth it.
Charles C.}Bergen County, NJ}172}410}30}-1}4}1/16/2012}As I age, I notice that more and more my body is rejecting raw fish and/or shellfish.  And as a self-anointed Japanese cuisine aficionado, I feared that this revelation will limit my Japanese food adventures.  Thank goodness we found this place.  The shabu shabu here is delicious and fun because you cook it yourself.  Unlike korean bbq (my usual goto joints for shabu), you won't leave this restaurant with your clothes reeking in smoke.  Come for weekend lunch and order the prime rib-eye shabu.  We noticed that the prime rib-eye was marbled with tasty fat while the regular rib-eye ($2 less) looked lean and dry.  Lunch shabu is cheaper than dinner and it comes with free ice cream for dessert.    Our group also ordered a couple of gobdol bibimbap to share after the shabu.  It was a little sweet and they do not add any gochujang, but it was oomai/oishi (tr. delicious) nevertheless.  For a legit Japanese restaurant, their gobdol was good.Call ahead and make reservations as there are only about 10 tables.  They also have sukiyaki on their menu.  Overall, a good restaurant to get cooked Japanese food.  And I prefer shabu over other cooked japanese options (eg. teriyaki, donburi, yakitori, takoyaki, yakisoba, japanese curry, etc.).
Nel A.}Manhattan, NY}52}393}17}-1}3}1/15/2012}Good. Tried the chicken hot pot. Broth is yummy.Salmon, & squid teriyaki were awesome. The unagi wrapped in egg was so good we ordered another. Perfect for winter with friends.
Asuka N.}New York, NY}345}1459}0}18}4}1/2/2012}Shabu Tatsu is a nice little restaurant that's nestled further east to where most of the Japanese joints in East Village are. My girlfriend and I came a month ago, and getting here early (pre-6 PM) meant we were able to get a seat without a reservation. Otherwise, you may end up waiting a bit (a previous time we came, we had to wait closer to 45 minutes), as there's only a limited number of tables in the small space. Service is pretty straightforward; the last time, the waiters were a bit late on bringing out the appetizers (they came after all the nabe ingredients were put out), but aside from that, the waiters were good about bringing around more water to make sure we could keep steaming our food.The appetizers were pretty good. In particular, the eel wrapped in egg was a cross between unagi and tamago sashimi; the egg acted as a complement to warm and fatty eel. The tofu was okay, if a bit unremarkable. The nabe was a delicious choice. We've done the shabu shabu before, which is good - you basically boil the beef in plain hot water, with veggies added for seasoning, and dip it in sauce. The broth for nabe is already flavored, though, which really brought out the smoky flavor of the duck. The meat cooks pretty quickly and is delicious without anything additional. Dessert was ice cream, which was a very well-prepared, icy version of red bean ice cream. For $24 per person, it was a very reasonable price for a full meal, along with complimentary cups of tea throughout.Shabu Tatsu is a great little spot in East Village that's good for either an intimate dinner in a booth or a group outing. Definitely call ahead of time if you're planning to come at standard dinner hours, though - it's a popular spot to be at. The appetizers didn't blow me away, but I'm a big fan of both the nabe and the shabu shabu.
Ashley B.}Urbana, IL}499}607}772}18}4}1/2/2012}Fun! I just went here with a group of friends that I hadn't seen in ages and we did the hot pot and it was freaking awesome. Luckily, two of them had done it before and walked us through the procedure, which was really helpful. So I guess this review isn't so much about the service (though everything was great, on pace, and polite) but more just the atmosphere and food. Yeah, we definitely didn't get seated immediately, but we were in good company outside while waiting, so it wasn't a big deal for us. I will say though, even in the dead of December, it was still hot as heck in there, so be aware. All in all though it was a really enjoyable experience and I'd be happy to return!
Sumit D.}New York, NY}46}274}64}-1}2}12/30/2011}While my friends thought the food was excellent, I thought it was pretty mediocre.  The meat just was not as tasty as the food I have had at places like Gyu Kaku, yet along the same price level.  The wait was more than 75 minutes, and the food was not the best I've ever had (shout out to Drake).
David W.}New York, NY}156}834}0}-1}4}12/26/2011}Looking for a good lunch spot in the EV on a cold afternoon?  Definitely put this place at the top of your list.  The restaurant was a little over half full so it was no problem getting seating, yet it didn't have that weird feeling from being the only table in a restaurant.  The menu itself has a few interesting choices but the lunch special hot pot is the steal.  For less than $20 you get a salad, rice, pork to throw into the hot pot (or seafood) and some ice cream at the end.  Along with the meat the pot comes loaded with veggies and noodles.  They also have several different broths to choose from, we ended up going for the soy milk (risky, I know, but I like to try different things).  Lucky for us, the soy milk didn't have a very strong flavor so that didn't turn into a disaster.  If you're not in the mood for hot pot, you can also do some grilling, though we didn't choose that option since I think it's an either or deal, no having cake and eating it too.  What else...oh yeah, we also had the bibimbap.  Not sure why a Korean dish made it  on the menu here, but it was a little unspectacular so I suggest you skip that and just order more meats to throw into the pot.
Jonathan c.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}12/25/2011}Best Japanese food I've ever had. Very authentic, and great selection of rare Japanese liquors.Great for those who like to treat their meals as a social environment and take their time eating while enjoying their company.
Joanie W.}Portland, OR}17}54}0}-1}2}12/20/2011}Went there last night for a quick shabu fix. -Waited 45 minutes to get a seat - should have read the yelp reviews ahead of time and saw all the recommendations for calling ahead.-When seated we were by the door and there was a constant draft. Also lots of people looming around us which was slightly uncomfortable-Servers were nice, but hard to get there attention because we were in the front corner surrounded by people waiting for a table-Not impressed by their Shabu. Didn't realize until after ordering that if I wanted flavored soup i should have gone with nabe. We cooked our food in boiling hot water that turned into soup that I could have made at home.-Didn't like the sauces, the ponzu was too sour and the other was peanut sauce. I prefer Chinese-style hotpot where you get to add a bunch of stuff to your sauce like garlic and hot sauce-Meat portions were decent, but my BF and I dropped $52 for the prime rib and we still had to order an appetizer and side of pork in order to even feel remotely full. Even then I could have eaten more.- All in all, spent 100$ on a meal that was so-so. That's also super expensive for hot pot in my opinion. I realize i probably should have ordered something else, but this meal wasn't extraordinary for the price I paid. Wouldn't come back, there are plenty of hot pot options around the city (Hakata ton ton cost less and was so much better!)
Connie K.}Redondo Beach, CA}10}32}7}-1}5}11/7/2011}Even though we were those irresponsible people who didn't make a reservation, they did their best to get us seated rather quickly. It was worth the wait, too, because the food was DELICIOUS. $26 combo for good meat, veggies, rice, and ICE CREAM!I'll definitely go again whenever I'm craving good shabu shabu!
Elizabeth J.}San Francisco, CA}589}635}749}18}5}11/4/2011Updatedreview}Came here again last night for some tasty Shabu Shabu. When I got there my friend informed me she was no longer eating meat (I almost had a heart attack) duh I come here for the meat!! Thankfully they let you do a Shabu pot with one person all veggie the other not! whoo hoo.  Huge amount of food. Great veggies, awesome meat, great Saki! Loved it as always.
Teresa L.}New York, NY}255}409}259}18}4}10/30/2011}Like most other restaurants in the East Village, the restaurant is SMALL. There are approximately 8 tables when you first enter. But lo and behold, there is a basement that houses 3 more tables. I was a party of 2, and we waited 10 to 15 minutes for a table in the basement. You get to the basement through a staircase near the kitchen. The host walks you to the basement so you're guaranteed not to get lost.Florence Y. is correct in mentioning that there is absolutely NO cell phone service in the basement. Neither my ATT nor my friend's Verizon service could penetrate through the kitchen. So do all of your websurfing while you're waiting for your table.I went to Shabu-Tatsu during the freak snowstorm of October, so I warmed up with some shabu-shabu. I like that there is a preset menu consisting of salad, shabu-shabu, and ice cream. We ordered the rib-eye shabu-shabu, and it filled up the bellies of two hungry girls.The salad was your standard Japanese salad: Greens + ginger dressing.The rib-eye shabu-shabu was great. The meat was so thinly sliced, they cooked very quickly in the pot. We had a range of side dishes to pair with our meat, including an assortment of vegetables, my favored shitake mushrooms, and flat noodles. What was different about Japanese shabu-shabu, in contrast to the Taiwanese hotpot that I'm used to, is that the sauce is already prepared for you. The sauce was tasty, but at Taiwanese hotpot restaurants I'm used to throwing together my own assortment of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sha-cha.The final course was one scoop of ice cream. I chose the green tea ice cream, and it was deliciously creamy and bitter without being too bitter.Lastly, the service provided was great; our waiter was attentive and provided warm towels to clean our hands. I would come back here the next time I'm craving Japanese shabu.
Tanya R.}Manhattan, NY}76}6}0}-1}5}10/18/2011}It's the second time I come here and the staff is just incredibly accommodating and so kind.  We were a group of 11, on a table that usually only fits 8, and they worked it out for us.We had the rib-eye and shrimp shabu shabu which was great.  Also, surprisingly the vegetable gyozas were delicious (although not too appealing as i have never tried green gyozas).One thing i really did not like was the roasted duck.  Very weird aftertaste and quite a strong flavor.And for dessert, you must try the green tea ice cream.  It's creamy and has a strong kick to it, but all the more reason to love it :)
CiCi L.}New York, NY}532}111}43}-1}4}10/11/2011}"Shabu Tatsu" for shabu-shabu, which means "swish-swish." This is a special kind of hot pot cooking where you swish thinly sliced meats and vegetables in a hot pot of water at the table, and then swish them again in sauces like sesame sauce for seasoning.
Joey X.}Manhattan, NY}20}117}0}-1}4}10/3/2011}We ordered the shabu shabu and it was really delicious. The portions are not that big -- we were three little Asian girls and we all cleaned out our plates -- and pretty pricey. It ended up being around $45/person. But the food was really, really good. The service was all right -- we squatted for an hour due to a late friend but the waitstaff didn't bother us too much.I took off one star because they put us in the basement where there was no cellphone reception. It was dark and little cavernous down there, so ambiance was definitely nonexistent. But the food was impeccable.
Christy R.}Fort Lee, NJ}1}5}0}-1}4}9/13/2011}Sukiyaki is my favorite menu here. The quality of their meat is good and the sukiyaki sauce is just  right for my taste.
Joyce L.}Jackson Heights, NY}6}39}1}-1}4}9/8/2011Updatedreview}I came here with a friend last night. We order a combo for 2 people. It included beef short ribs, chicken, squid, shrimp, onions, carrots, peppers, salmon + sides + soup + salad + ice-cream. The quality of the food wasn't bad and it came with 3 kinda sauces. The honey mustard was too sweet, some kinda sweet soy sauce which wasn't that speacial and the spicy sauce wasn't spicy enough. The biggest problem was they didn't give you enough sauces... I really enjoyed the beef short ribs and salmon, but overall the food was just ok. I had better BBQ at Korean town. We also ordered the pan fried pork dumplings and they had very good flavor! The greentea ice-cream was AWESOME!! Not too sweet and very strong greentea flavor! The service was really good too!
Florence Y.}Brooklyn, NY}261}331}22}-1}5}8/22/2011Updatedreview}Didn't know they had a secret basement downstairs - 3 tables,  4 seats each. The A/C tends to be rather cool there, so be prepared.Tip-bits:They do not take reservations for parties of less than 4.Free 1 order of beer/alcohol with each shabu shabu order/ per person till 7pmNo reception in the basement
Stanley S.}Kew Gardens, NY}10}48}23}-1}4}8/22/2011}Got a birthday dinner to attend at this place... i m a frequent goer of St mark's area for dinner... but i have never noticed this place until now.... normally i just stopped at chikalicious and not walk further down the block... at first, i was thinkin what so special about this shabu shabu place... except this is japanese... and i was wrong... it is a little diff... besides shabu shabu... there r many other diff dishes... good side dishes... we have the pork belly and grilled squid... i would say those items are above average... for the main dinner... we had a beef shabu shabu and a duck clay pot thingy... i enjoy that alot.. especially the soup... i couldnt resist drinkin all the soup at the end...I will def com back to this place especially winter time...
Ian M.}Manhattan, NY}43}203}1}-1}5}8/21/2011}Eating here was so much fun. I shared the shabu shabu (hot pot) and out came a large plate of thinly sliced meat, and a large assortment of vegetables, which we were to cook in a large, simmering bowl of water (which turns into a tasty soup post cooking). Everything tasted fresh, and our meal came with a free drink (happy hour every day), bowl of rice, dipping sauces and ice cream. You'll leave both entertained and stuff.
Nikki H.}Brooklyn, NY}42}268}217}18}2}8/20/2011}This was my first experience with shabu shabu..............it was "ok", not something that I would try again.. The waitstaff was very attentive and very thorough in explaining the process to me.
Daniel T.}BAYSIDE HILLS, NY}0}21}0}-1}5}8/15/2011}Came here with a friend and we both got the prime rib eye beef shabu shabu. I'm not sure how the non prime meat tastes like, but the prime rib eye beef was delicious. Definitely the best shabu shabu meat I've had. Dont come here expecting the water you cook it in to be flavored. I liked how clean it was cooked and dipping into the wonderful sauces was more than enough added taste. The waiters/waitresses are very attentive and are always coming to check on you to make sure you're fine. Be warned you may be sat in a table that is split down the middle to accompany two parties, but it didn't matter to us as there was no one there, but I can see how that could get very awkward. The green tea ice cream after was excellent. Definitely come check this place out! Don't let the hot weather deter you.
Jin C.}New York, NY}33}997}148}18}5}8/13/2011}When you're meant to cook the food yourself, you can't really assess the restaurant based on how the food is prepared. What comes to mind is the freshness of the ingredients, the quality of the service, and the ambience. Shabu-Tatsu excels in every single one of these aspects. Portions are generous, and the hotpot experience is so engaging that you cannot help but appreciate the thought that has gone into every single component of the experience.The various dipping sauces, the server that comes every so often to remove the scum from the soup, the little soup bowl that comes toward the end of our meal with salt and pepper at the bottom of it to season the by-now flavorful broth - all in all it was a really enjoyable meal that definitely keeps the table entertained.$26ish a person got us a glass of plum wine (happy hour, 5-7 pm), a starter salad, our choice of meat for the hotpot, rice, vegetables, rice noodles, a side dish of scallions and daikon, our choice of ice cream (green tea, red bean, choc and vanilla) and hot green tea.They might have to wash less pots and pans but it's made up for by the massive amounts of servingware.
Kevin W.}Manhattan, NY}45}548}18}-1}5}8/1/2011}Stellar for Shabu Shabu.  I recommend the Prime Meat - it's fattier and more flavorful.  I always get the meal for 2 - it comes with rice and veggies and ice cream at the end.  They also make a little soup at the end from the broth.  One of my friends makes a mandatory stop here anytime he's in new york, no matter the weather. Also, they have some of the best bibimbop (bokumbop) anywhere.  Gets a nice crunch on the rice at the bottom of the bowl.  The pork kimchi bibimbop was outstanding.  They only take reservations for groups of 4 or more (I believe).  So you'll have to wait if a smaller group.  Also, the downstairs has seating too, but a worse ambience b/c it's like a cave where you can hear every word of the conversation of your neighboring tables.
Ann L.}San Diego, CA}167}140}39}-1}4}7/31/2011}Usually I'm not a fan of eating hot things in hot weather. This NYC summer has been one of the warmest since I've been here, but one night after it rained, the heat retreated enough for me to check out this Shabu place. Didn't have reservations, but the quoted wait time was 40 minutes - perfect for walking a few blocks down to the aptly named "Thirsty Scholar" for a drink and then returning for dinner. Came back after 40 minutes, and was seated within a minute. Sweet! Since there were only about 10 tables in the entire restaurant, this came as a pleasant surprise. Shabu Tatsu's menu has both Shabu and BBQ, but I was more inclined toward the "Shabu," because, well, it's in the name. They have various types of meats available - I chose Shabu A, which was the prime rib eye (B is just the regular) and all the fixings, including vegetables/noodles, a salad, rice, and dessert. When the plate of meat first came out, I was very skeptical - it didn't look like a lot, and there were two of us eating. In the end, though, the amount of meat was just right. And the quality of the meat - damn! Marbled, tender, flavorful, and perfect for the light dipping sauces provided. At $26 per person, it was definitely worth it. I didn't leave hungry and I learned an important lesson - shabu isn't just for winter anymore!
Josh H.}Manhattan, NY}40}7}0}-1}5}7/14/2011}this might seem extreme but this is my favorite restaurant in the whole world.  we get the hot pot prime rib eye for 2 and then we ask for another plate of just the ribeye and we go to work.  we also get the berkshire sausages as an app which never disappoints.  the one thing that probably falters at this place is conversation as my gf gets annoyed at me moaning and commenting on how damn good everything is after every bite...which i do every time we go there.  thank you shabu tatsu for being you.  Love,Josh
storm v.}Manhattan, NY}23}51}5}-1}5}7/8/2011}The smell of the beef cooking,the nooodle simmering in the hot pot, OMG the taste of it so good.The service is on the top very attentive ,friendly too GREAT !!!!!!!!
ET B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}26}0}-1}4}7/8/2011}Prime rib-eye, vegetables and noodles were all great. A bit pricey (for shabu-shabu in my experience) at $26 per person but you do get a lot of good quality food. Wasn't my favorite ponzu sauce in the world, but I did really like the sesame sauce.Ice cream and tea at the end of the meal (included in the price) was nice.I'll definitely be coming back. With Curry-ya two doors down this is going to be a well-visited block for me.
James C.}Levittown, NY}0}10}0}-1}4}6/28/2011}I fell in love with Shabu Shabu when I lived in Tokyo. This place has great, authentic food. It is a little pricier then Tokyo, but hey, that is life. The same can be said about most international cuisines. My only regret is they do not offer the 90 minute all you can eat / all you can drink options that I had in Tokyo. This is still well worth it. I bring my friends here everytime they visit.
Jihea P.}New York, NY}24}87}12}-1}3}6/27/2011}4 stars for food; 2 stars for service - averages out to 3.I'm budget cautious and I usually check the online menu & pricing before going to a new restaurant. For this restaurant, the prices in the menu is different from the prices on their online menu - it's 18.75 per person online but begins at 24 per person in the store. I was a bit surprised, a 5 dollar difference per person not being small.My friends and I (group of 5) got there right at 5pm on a Sunday when they first opened. We were seated on a longer table - we asked if we can sit in the corner table that accomodates more people (with 2 boiling pits) but they said no. Later on, two separate groups of two people were seated at that table with a paper divider in the middle. We still had one more person more than the two separate parties. Not cool.I had to ask for more water about 5 times, three times of which they actually refilled. Thanks?Food was good though. We first got the shabu shabu and then got the sukiyaki (thus we wanted to sit where there were two pots instead of one). I loved their sukiyaki (the difference being that shabu shabu is cooked in boiling hot water/clear broth and sukiyaki in more a soy-sauce based broth). If I go back, I'd definitely do the sukiyaki. We also got appetizers - the pork zyoga. It was not worth it. They give you six pieces of the dumplings that was probably defrosted and heated out of a bag. The okonomiakyi was good though, albeit small. I'm used to the nicely sized delicious ones from Oh Taisho. Overall, I don't think I'd splurge on shabu shabu for 24 per person, exc tip and tax. I can easily get same value in Flushing. Oh - the green tea ice cream that comes out as part of the shabu shabu/sukiyaki package was delish.
Keejoo L.}Alexandria, VA}169}535}137}-1}4}6/18/2011}Last winter I discovered the love of shabushabu here.  Before I came to NYC this word was the most foreign thing I think that I had ever heard.The place is small but it makes it comfy. Walking into this restaurant in the cold winter nights makes every bad feeling go away. The smell of beef cooking... noodles simmering in big pots. Its the place to go for a good meal!  Highly reccomend in you are in the east village. Come early! It packs up fast.
Brandy L.}London, United Kingdom}2374}405}1400}-1}5}6/6/2011}Sukiyaki sukiyaki  sukiyaki the Best Shabu Shabu downtown come early or 4sure have a reservation!
Xuefan Z.}New York, NY}36}30}0}-1}3}5/30/2011}it was ok... felt like some of the stuff wasn't enough for me... dipping stuff in raw egg was fun though and delicious~ but eventually i became a bit tired of the texture, too. You could choose not to do this though.menu was a bit confusing at first. we had two people and i remember you have to order the same type twice? like one was hotpot (the kind you dip in) and one was nabe..(nabe probably means hotpot...?? but here im referring to the kind you eat in the pot!). We wanted to get one of each but couldn't...
reid h.}San Jose, CA}8}18}3}-1}5}5/25/2011}It has been years since I have been to Shabu-Tatsu but I used to go several times a month and I'm sure I have been there at least 100 times.  This is hands down (what does that mean, anyway?) my favorite restaurant in the world.  I would give my left big toe if I could be there right now.  If you live close enough to eat at Shabu-Tatsu, go.....  GO........  NOW..........
Sin K.}New York, NY}245}18}0}-1}4}5/20/2011}I've been here twice and it has never disappointed me.  It is hard to find good shabu shabu in the city.  Usually, I end up opting for Koreatown for the bbq.  Last night was no exception.  My boyfriend and I were debating were to go have dinner since we have been staying in and cooking a lot.  We wanted to treat ourselves and had the great idea of trying to scoop this shabu shabu.  It is impossible to get a table at this place so I called to see if we had the chance to reserve a table (was hoping I could, even though I was making it the same night and 1 1/2hours in advance, which sounds ridiculous....yes, i know).  The Maitre D suggested to be there between 7-7:30.  Restaurants have their rush between 8-8:30, so we both rushed there after work.Once sat, we ordered a bottle of sake and the prime ribeye shabushabu.The bottle of sake we got was extremely smooth and complimented the meat very well.  It definitely cleansed the palette and definitely did not overshadow the main dish.  The prime ribeye was very delicate and very light.  The veggies and noodles were a great addition to this cooking event.My only criticism is that their menu is a bit confusing to read.  We weren't sure what came with the meat.  It gives other options at the bottom of each page and the server didn't ask what we wanted.  Overall, this place deserves all of my four stars.  Definitely a good move on both parts.
Erin M.}Manhattan, NY}1273}546}409}18}5}5/7/2011}I've been here twice and I love this place. The food is really great, there is just so much to eat! You can put in all your veggies and meats and let them boil together. The soup afterwards is super delicious.  Another thing you should try is the sukiyaki where they use a special brown sauce to cook the veggies and meat. After cooking, you dip it in raw egg before eating it with rice. IT'S AMAZING. The people here are very friendly and very helpful. They will help suggest to you the best options for what you're looking for. I would definitely try this. It's a nice departure from sushi if you're looking for Japanese food.
Shuo L.}TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY}348}82}0}-1}4}5/3/2011}Decent place to go if you want to have hot-pot / shabu-shabu other than Quickly or other Chinese restaurant. Plum wine there is sweet. Dessert is not as good as expected... not creamy enough and way too sweet again... $$-$$$, quite pricier place for hot-pot.
Wahed K.}Astoria, NY}651}734}1505}18}2}5/2/2011}I have had Chinese hot pot before but this was my first experience with shabu shabu. I am not sure how I feel about putting meat in plain water and then eating it. I mean I get it - the meat is fresh so the idea is to taste the essence of the meat but you know what? I will take my broth with chili, garlic and other flavors you want to put in there any day. It gets better towards the end as you put in more stuff in the water but I can do without the bland tasting slices of meat. Lets face it, we are not talking about slices of high grade beef - they are fresh and decent, but not to the point where I don't mind dipping it in plain hot water. The search for good shabu shabu continues...
A K.}Sunnyvale, CA}64}135}0}-1}4}4/29/2011}I'm used to the messy Chinese version of hot pot and was floored by my shabu shabu experience here. It was very pricey - my guest and I chose the beef and pork shabu option but we had SO...MUCH...FOOD...Efficient service, simple decor, awesome fresh food.
Fawn Q.}Fargo, ND}160}144}30}-1}4}4/22/2011}This place was really yummy! I really want to go back soon!I've never had Japanese shabu before so being loyal fan of Chinese hot pot, I had hesitations coming to this place, but i was very wrong!My friend and i each ordered combination shabu plates (i think beef rounds?) which came with meats, veggies, noodles, ur usual hot pot ingredients, then they brought out a big pot for us to share, i kind of prefer this compared to ur own individual shabu, except the base was just water vs some sort of broth-which is wat im used to. it was surprisingly very good. They give you two dipping sauce, both were were very good. I think the meat was very fresh and good quality, which made it that much tastier and my stomach very happy. We also got a few bottles of warm sake, which was very good! har har har.The ambiance of the place was also great, lots of Japanese decoration and all the servers are Japanese too. Overall a very yummy and fun place.
Vi N.}Manhattan, NY}374}237}1000}-1}4}4/19/2011}This is probably as good as it gets for shabu in NYC. Shabu Tatsu is pretty legit, except for a few minor details. -Sharing Pots - this is weird to me, most real shabu places gives each person their own pot (usually set up in a bar style seating), this way everyone can season the broth to their liking. This is hard since I usually eat spicier then the people I am dining with, so I usually tone it down, and that kinda kills the experience for me.Someone once told me, sharing shabu pots is like sharing toothbrushes... u just dont. haha-Garlic - they dont allow you to put garlic into the pot!!! as you know garlic is KEY to shabu, you put it in your ponzu sauce, in your sesame peanut sauce, in your POT! when I ask the waiter for extra garlic, she told me i was not allowed to put in my pot for fear of stinking up the restaurant. lol.-Pure Caps - this place doesnt have any! if you want the dipping sauces to be spicy,  your only options are the powder or oil, which dont really do anything for me, so i've learned to bring my own pure caps. Yes, i'm THAT girl, the one that carries pure caps in her purse =XOverall, for what it is, it's pretty good for NYC. It does not compare to shabu in California, but it does the job. The price is on the pricier side, but hey, you cant win them all right??
Christina S.}Brooklyn, NY}74}39}0}-1}5}4/16/2011}I'm giving this place 5 stars solely because I'm a sukiyaki fan!! Seriously, I can't find this on many menu. The food are ok, but i wish they come in bigger portion. It's a good place for groups of 4, to sit and chill.
P H.}Grand Prairie, TX}2104}1595}4321}-1}3}4/16/2011}We had a reservation for 9 @ 830p. We got seated @ 930p. Not too happy with the service and what a bad initial impression.Service: 2.5/5Decor: 3.5/5-Many coat hangers placed near each table which was a great idea-No more paper windowsFood: 3/5-The Prime Rib and Rib-eye were decent. I read some reviews prior to arrival and thought "Ok, so portion is a good amount". Wrong, there was not enough and we left hungry.-The broth was good but most of the party claimed it was "too sweet".-The green tea ice cream was creamy and delicious though. I'm still on the lookout for some awesome hotpot.
Annie C.}Manhattan, NY}9}76}2}-1}4}4/14/2011}Went here with office visitors - we ordered the sukiyaki and it was pretty good. The prices are kinda high though - definitely not a "casual" dining spot, despite its ambiance.
Esther K.}New York, NY}202}356}81}-1}4}3/11/2011}I'm a huge shabu shabu fan! I just recently came here for the midnight madness deal! It's basically $8 off the original price if you come in on Friday/ Saturday between 12-1:30am. I've also come here on regular hours as well. I could eat shabu shabu all the time, so far this has been my favorite joint in NYC but I will keep the search going for other shabu shabu places! NOTE: I've been to hot pot places and it's just not the same... I prefer to cook my meat in water and dip in ponzu/ peanut sauce rather than all those hearbally flavors in hot pot.
Jason K.}Chula Vista, CA}27}28}20}-1}2}3/9/2011}Shabu shabu in plain water............ So I asked the server, where is the broth that a chef should have prepared for hours and hours. And she said that is JAPANESE shabu shabu. Then what the f* are we eating? It is the same around nyc. But the service and ingredients were good enough. I make my own at home now. The broth takes 5hrs to perfect. Aye...
Lindsay L.}New York, NY}38}136}1}-1}4}2/27/2011}My boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner, and I thought the meal was fantastic! We got two shabu plates: prime rib and shrimp. The shabu comes with salad, various veggies and noodles, meat, rice, and ice cream and tea for dessert. Pretty good deal for $25/person!I thought the prime rib far out-shined the shrimp, so I would recommend getting a couple orders of prime rib when you come. My boyfriend thought the meal was a little bland since you're basically just cooking your food in water, but the two dipping sauces were really fantastic, so I thought there was plenty of flavor.I definitely recommend this place for bringing family and friends from out of town or for date night. We went around 6:30pm on a Saturday, and we didn't have any problems getting a table, but I called beforehand, and they were only taking reservations for parties of 4 or more, and they were booked from 7-10pm. So, try to come on the early side on the weekend!
Lee J.}Brooklyn, NY}4}109}0}-1}3}2/17/2011}Service - They treated us pretty well for first-timers.  Got a little of the rushy vibe at first, but I understood 'cause they had a major wait, it was already 8, and we were newcomers who could possibly be clueless about how to proceed.  Once we ordered it was a lot more laid back, and everyone was very sweet and attentive.Food - We had the nabemono.The broth was outrageously delicious, and it was certainly piled high with a nice array of some of my favorite vegetables.However, for 24 a person, I think the meat could have been higher quality.  Yes, the price includes salad, rice, and ice cream, but none of those were anywhere near above average.  Not even the rice.I have to go back and try the shabu shabu and the grill cooking.  Seems like that may be more of their specialty.
Leonard N.}Lansdowne, PA}8}52}198}-1}5}2/15/2011}This place was totally worth the 2 hour drive. The restaurant opened promptly at 5:00 p.m. and the staff took time to explain how to best enjoy the shabu-shabu and of course, the food was absolutely delicious.
Jeff C.}Somerset, NJ}4}66}1}-1}4}2/14/2011}This is one of my favorite places to bring friends to when they come visit.  It's a great dining experience for people that aren't used to it (i.e. - non Asians).You need to try to avoid the wait on Fri and Sat nights, otherwise you may be annoyed waiting outside because the place is small and gets busy.The Shabu Shabu is great, and we always have a great time when we eat here.  Note to self: Eat here again soon, it's been a while...
Pam Z.}Chicago, IL}38}235}1}-1}3}2/12/2011}The ambiance and service of this place are great.But I can't help but be loyal to my favorite shabu in the city, Quickly.  Which is about half as cheap with about twice as much food.  And the broth there is a lot better.Still pretty good though.  Must mention that you all share a single pot rather than having your own.  Could be a problem if you have a vegetarian in your mix.
Christine K.}New York, NY}93}222}27}-1}5}2/10/2011}Wow the Shabu here is so high quality it made my tummy super happy.  While across the country my friends were eating at Prime Shabu in SF, I had a craving for Shabu myself and walked into Shabu Tatsu.  We had a short weight and then were seated promptly.  Two Shabu plates and salad and veggies, noodles sauces later we were sooo happy.  The meat was this nice red color and cooked quickly.We sat there for about two hours just talking while we enjoyed desert.  Not once did they put down the bill and stare at us to leave (which is very typical for these types of establishments).We would definitely go again!
Renee K.}New York, NY}204}68}15}-1}3}2/9/2011}I've had better.....However my favorite Shabu place is in California, so Shabu-Tatsu East Village, overhyped, overpriced, overcrowded, pretty much monopolizes the shabu hole in my heart when I am in New York.I am usually not critical of restaurants with such positive yelp consensus. However, this place is pricey (about $80 for two people excluding drinks), portions are small (compared to all you can eat & drink shabu shabu for $35 in Japan town in San Francisco, sigh). It is also insanely packed with about 1.5 hour wait or MORE on any given night. Good thing I live nearby and put my name on the list, then take a nap and come back to the restaurant later. On some weekends they will only take reservations for 4 people and up.The quality of the meat/seafood/veggies is great. It's all very fresh and tender, but the peanut dipping sauce and ponzu sauce lean towards salty. I guess if you're craving Japanese shabu shabu and have a group event, there's not really anywhere else in Manhattan. I certainly always go back, even though my heart doesn't skip a beat over this place.
Shielah M.}Freehold, NJ}189}36}9}-1}4}2/8/2011}I must say I was utterly surpirse with this small shabu-shabu in the East Village. I had made reservation for 10 people and although they had messed up on my reservation they were very accomodating. It was just what my friends and I needed especially in this cold winter! We ordered enough food for everyone to share and it was roughly about $25 pp including tax and gratuities! You can't beat that! I love it!
Jane K.}San Francisco, CA}4452}1215}1901}-1}4}2/3/2011}Swish Swish. Gobble Gobble. That is the song of Shabu-tatsu. Well, in our case it may also include "Chug, Chug." This little restaurant oasis in the East Village is home to about ten tables equipped with heated centerpieces that can be filled with either a grill or a hot pot. We've never strayed away from shabu shabu so I can only speak to that. For roughly $25 a head you'll receive plates piled high with beautifully marbled short rib meat, light and filmy pork slices, and raw gray shrimpies. Paired with some dipping sauces and a bowl of sticky rice...do you really need anything else? Oh yeah, hot sake and a pitcher of overpriced beer. The servers is actually quite attentive here, and while our waitress kept advising us against ordering more sake for the table we didn't feel rushed. Be sure to make a reservation beforehand, there's a high demand for swishing among the gobble set.
Kevin L.}New York, NY}1048}1339}4392}-1}4}2/1/2011}I can haz plates piled high with slices of meat? Kthxbai!With ~$25 set menu dinners inclusive of all the veggie fixin's, a solid portion of protein, starter salad, seasoned soup, and a sweet treat dessert to round it all out... the value proposition weighs strongly in favor of return trips to Shabu-Tatsu. Top that grub all off with $18 pitchers of Sapporo and there's no excuse for failing to have a great meal.Plan ahead and make reservations for large groups, because the space is anti-large. The largest booths seat six if you're -really- friendly and/or your group is primarily constituted of svelte, slender girls.I've never -not- left satisfyingly full, tummy tired from belly-laughing, and needing to pee like a racehorse shortly thereafter. All signs of a quality hotpot experience.
Martin W.}Brooklyn, NY}173}591}431}18}4}1/31/2011}Being my first hot pot experience I am well on my way to more wonderful experiences. The best things in life are usually the simplest things. Service was very attentive. Vegetables were fresh. Carnivore satisfaction. Nothing more to say.
Wing L.}Long Island, NY}204}245}78}-1}4}1/9/2011}when it's cold in NY and I'm hungry, one type of food always comes to my mind: hot-pot, or in Japanese, shabu shabu.This restaurant comes PACKING! So, expect tons of wait.  But patience is a virtue and often rewarded. I saw many people waiting even if it's 1 hour plus.We got the shabu-shabu for 2, where you can choose your choice of meats (the prime rib eye and the beef were delicious!) and comes with assortment of vegges/noodles.Being Chinese, you'd think that the boiling water has a pre-made soup base.  Not here, it's just boiling water with a dash of seaweed.  BUT...this is actually good!  For once, you can enjoy the natural ingredients to bring out the soup flavor.  Mixed with cabbage, mushroom, tofu, and spinach and meats, the soup becomes sweet, light, and gives off a clean feeling.  This is how soup should be (Au natural).As my favorite artist Utada Hikaru would say, "simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight."  I couldn't agree more!
W Z.}New York, NY}3}12}4}-1}4}1/8/2011}Gosh, the meat and veggy that comes with the shabu shabu is so good and fresh. It's in very small portion and quite on the expensive side. However it is a great experience, I don't really recommend for groups that are more than 6 people since they only give one pot for 8 people. I will try the late night special one day.
Katie S.}New York, NY}12}26}1}-1}4}12/17/2010}We came Wednesday night, four ppl. Two of us ordered shabu-shabu, I had beef bibimbap. My bibimbap was surprisingly good, better than those served in Korean town. The portion was great and meat was in good quality. Dipping and sauce are just right. I will come back this place for its rice dishes and also probably gonna try their noodle dishes, too.
Ginny L.}New York, NY}51}371}35}-1}3}12/9/2010}After reading reviews on Yelp about this place....i thought to myself....i gotta come here! So I took my lazy butt there with my friend for dinner. The place was quite packed at about 6:30pm..So we were seated downstairs...The seating area is quite large..which i loved...i hate when i have to eat and im all crumbled up and stuff...makes it so uncomfortable...Anywho...We ordered their shabu shabu dish...we had the Prime Eye Rib Beef and the Pork one...We also ordered their sake as well..The food itself comes with salad, vegetables and noodles, rice, and ice cream.The food was great and i mean there isnt much to say about shabu shabu...you just dip the meat in and then shake it around....and theres two types of sauce you can dip it in - ponzu sauce and sesame sauceThe reason why it received a 3 was because...the portion of the meat was so little...and as with service..it was nice and all, but i felt really rushed...like you sit down, must quickly decide what to order and then boom you eat and then you paid and leave...i mean its shabu shabu...people would like to talk and socialize..and i know turnover rate has to be high, but i just didnt like how the waiters and waitress checked on us a couple times when they gave us our bill to see if we were ready to bounce...and when we finished paying, they checked again....i didnt know if there was people waiting as we were downstairs...if we were upstairs we would have left sooner if we saw people waiting by the door...Other then that...it was nice....=)
Sarah L.}Brooklyn, NY}4}40}0}-1}4}11/21/2010}Love this place.  Perfect food for a chilly evening.  Really good quality hot pot with nice booths on the 1st level, the ground floor is a bit budget).   Small space -- be prepared to wait if you have a group larger than 4.  Good mix of people- Japanese business men and young people.  I always get the prime rib eye plate.  Through the whole experience you get a big plate of thinly sliced beef and a big plate of mixed vegetables (mushrooms, carrots, scallion, cabbage, watercress, tofu and two types of noodles).  Not to mention rice, side salad and a scoop of ice-cream at the end of the meal.  For about $20 per person... theres lots of food and certainly a good deal.Looking forward to going back.
Xue T.}New York, NY}81}145}333}-1}5}11/19/2010}Shabu Tatsu in East Village - You've won me over! Truly, this place is on my list of go-to-hold-birthday-events. I called about 2 weeks ahead to reserve tables for a party of 12.  Seeing photos of the place through Yelp and their website, I was afraid that our visit would cause a fire hazard due to tight spacing.  To my surprise, they were able to accommodate all12 of us by upgrading to a private room.  The private room fits only 12 people (maybe 14 if you squeeze 2 more on the bench by the wall) - 3 square tables (4 seats each, all close to one another) each with space for shabu shabu or BBQ.  It's a very cozy private room located in the basement (though the 2 seats by the door had a bit of air draft but not to worry - hot soup was its cure!) and just enough lighting. I loved the setting. The waiters were very attentive, so courteous, friendly... I will definitely come back.  Oh, there was a timing constraint on our reservation: We were told that we could only stay for 2 hours (arrive at 6 PM and MUST leave at 8 PM) in the private rom - this was a bit of disaster as a few of us ran late but everything worked out because the food were very fresh and good - it was just within an hour we ate most of the food and had time to bring in a birthday cake (Waiters helped keep in the fridge, we brought our own lighter), and each of us got complimentary ice cream as part of our order.Food: My table of 4 ordered Shabu Shabu - 2 orders of prime rib eye, 1 order of shrimp, 1 order of chicken. Everything fresh.  Came with 2 sauces which were used to dip the meats or... noodles, veggies, rice in actually. Each person got 1 bowl of rice and side salad. A large plateful of veggies (shittake mushrooms!!) and noodles.  With the rice, it was JUST enough food. We were not entirely full (~85%) but the experience and cozy environment trumped it all. Shabu Tatsu - please offer your late night special a little earlier than 12 am, I'll be there in a jiffy!Just a note: This is a japanese shabu shabu place, not korean shabu shabu. Don't expect to get tons of flavor in the soup.  This is simple shabu shabu dining.  If you want intense flavor, go to midtown for korean shabu shabu or flushing for chinese shabu shabu.
peter H.}Brooklyn, NY}6}10}0}-1}5}11/10/2010}First time with shabu shabu, but it was amazing. Plus my japanese girlfriend also gives Shabu Tatsu high marks for its authenticity. Highly recommended!
Ell C.}New York, NY}47}189}14}-1}4}11/3/2010}My friends was in town for the weekend and she wanted to eat at her favorite Shabu Shabu spot. They put their name on the waiting list and after an hour of walking around returned in time to be seated for some superb shabu. I tried the pork while everyone else asked for beef. The burner was aflame and all we needed to do was toss in the extras - mushrooms, lettuce, noodles, carrots, bamboo, onions etc. Next time I would like to try the shrimp! I would later learn that the meat and extras would brew a nice hearty broth for the soup de jour! Be sure to skim the the top on occasion to remove the excess fat from the boiling meat. Very decently priced and best with large groups. PS - Make sure to bring along a take out container and reusable bag for leftovers!
justin t.}New York, NY}25}189}3}-1}4}10/26/2010}8PM Saturday night -- 45 minute wait. Seems worth it as everyone inside has huge smiles on and the people waiting are elderly japanese people so we decided to wait it out.We ordered the prime rib eye and regualr rib eye shabu shabu and pork and kimchi bibimbap.I say just go for the prime, which is only $2 more. The extra marbalization really makes the meat more tender, especially when sliced this thin. The broth seemed a little weak to me, taking a star off.The bibimbap was OK -- would have prefered them to keep it in the stone pot a little longer for some crispier rice.Yay for ice cream included.
Patricia C.}Queens, NY}169}755}3645}18}2}10/25/2010}Instead of coming here for Shabu Shabu, 4 of us ordered the Yakiniku - Complete B.B.Q. dinner (appetizer, entre, dessert). The marinated meat was just ok, nothing special.  My friends, on the other hand, ordered the shabu shabu and said that the soup base was a bit bland.  I guess I shall venture out to other shabu shabu places next time.PS:  The green tea ice cream was all I liked from the entire meal.PPS:  There is a private room downstairs the restaurant for parties of 12+.
Yoyo T.}Los Angeles, CA}22}70}0}-1}5}10/17/2010}The only bad thing that happened on my Shabu-Tatsu night was the 45 minute wait on a Sunday night. But after we sat down, it was smooth sailing. The restaurant is small, cozy and clean, and the service was great. We started with some appetizers of gyoza and pitchers of beer. We dove in to the seafood bbq and the prime eye beef. Ohh, the prime eye beef, how I love you. At the very end, we started slowing down and the sweet broth condensed over the fire and it became sticky sweet. But adding a little water would've solved it. After dinner, we had red bean and green tea ice cream. The great tea was strong, but not sweet or creamy enough to balance the matcha, but the red bean was pretty good. I'd go back there in a heartbeat.
Isabelle N.}Brooklyn, NY}4}5}33}-1}4}10/9/2010}I had a craving for shabu, and this place was within walking distance. It was different than the shabu shabu I had in Chinatown so everything was new to me. I got a pot of boiling water in front of me, and I'm needed to add all the veggies and meat into the pot. I got 2 sauce in front of me for dipping, and it was also served with a bowl of rice. The quality of the meats and veggies is excellent. It was very fresh. The service was attentive and nice. I didn't know this, but this place is intended for group dining. Most of the items on the menu are prepared with a minimum of 2 orders. It's not really made for solo dining. I think the only gripe is my boyfriend ordered the lemon squash soda, and it tasted like Sprite. He was expecting something more exotic tasting.
Harry K.}New York, NY}26}11}0}-1}4}10/3/2010}What a great and interesting place. A little $$$, but its not just a meal its a fun experience for a date or for friends. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT GETTING THE Dolsot bibimbap!
Jason W.}New York, NY}3}4}0}-1}4}9/28/2010}Shabu-shabu is a brilliant way to eat a dinner and Shabu-Tatsu is an excellent place to have it. Authentic Japanese. Even though its the only place of its kind I've had downtown, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's *the* best place downtown. Trust me, I just know.In shabu-shabu one cooks his or her own meat and vegetables, but at the same time, is also making a soup, which he or she will eat with noodles after they're done enjoying the meat and veg. So it's not only a dinner--it's a unique kind of interactive culinary process. If you have not ever tried it, and you are at all into Japanese food even just a little bit, you have to try it. that's all there is to it. Great for small parties, big parties, young and old, everyone. It's also a really healthful way to eat and whenever I'm in need of a warm, hearty, restorative kind of meal I head over here.Because this place does it right every time. Been here countless times and haven't had anything but quality fresh produce and meat. Service is good--they know exactly what they're doing, and the place is a well-oiled machine. They also have some nice appetizers, gyozas and what not as well as draft beer.They have several main courses on the menu including korea style BBQ but don't mess around, go for the beef shabu shabu.
Yolanda L.}Brooklyn, NY}143}181}29}-1}4}9/19/2010}Perfect spot for your soupy cravings!  Was going to the the shabu shabu but last minute changed my mind and got the chicken nabe and was so glad I did.The nabe is a bit pricey at $23 per person with a minimum of 2 orders but totally worth it in my opinion.  BF and I got the chicken nabe which comes with rice, udon noodles, dessert and tea.  The nabe itself was full of clear cellophane noodles, chunks of chicken thigh with the skin on, enoki and shitake mushrooms, scallions and assorted vegetables such as carrots, cucmbers and leafy greens all cooked in a japanese style broth that intensifies in flavor as the ingredients boil down.LOVEE it.  It was soooo good and I felt totally healthy helping myself to a big portion of vegetables noodles and broth and although they give you more water to add to the broth if it gets too strong, we never added any water and just savored the flavorful broth.  Will definitely be a favorite spot since winter is approaching!The ice cream you get at the end of this hot soupy meal is a plus also, you get to choose between green tea, red bean, chocolate and vanilla and you really cant go wrong with green tea ice cream, although red bean is my personal favorite, just smooth and creamy with a hint of sweetness.  Must try!
Kelly T.}New York, NY}31}85}0}-1}5}9/19/2010}This might be one of our favorite places to go in the city.  In fact, it's becoming our "special occasion" dinner place.1) Best quality shabu ingredients in the city- high quality and fresh (very important, where there isn't a lot of additional flavoring to mask the taste of the food itself)2) Open late- on weekends we've been here past midnight3) Nice "meal deal" - the meals come with salad, shabu, rice, soup, and ice cream4) Fast and friendly service5) Adequate space - almost every table is its own booth w/ benches, so you don't feel cramped (compared to other japanese places where you're shoulder to shoulder with the next table)The only negatives are that during peak hours you should be prepared to wait.  I would recommend being ready to spend about 30 minutes browsing around the block or grabbing a drink around the corner while you wait.
Amanda K.}New York, NY}2}38}0}-1}4}8/16/2010}I love this place~ The shabu shabu with the prime eye beef is very good but what really made this place memorable for me was the bibimbap.  I was at first skeptical about trying a bibimbap at a Japanese place..after all, bibimbap is a Korean dish and I thought the place was merely trying to make its menu more eclectic by adding this dish.   I was very surprised to see how GOOD it was.  It was possibly the best bibimbap I have ever tasted, even better than the bibimbaps I have had at any Korean restaurants.  I don't know what their magic ingredient is- perhaps there is something with the sauce, perhaps they use better vegetables, or the beef is marinated better.  Whatever it was, the bibimbap was unforgettable-  all the more reason to love this great restaurant.
Robin J.}San Francisco, CA}82}24}1}-1}4}8/11/2010}This was my first shabu experience and I am sold! Because I have nothing to compare it to, I can't justify throwing around 5 stars as of yet but I really enjoyed it! I had the chicken, he had the beef. T'was delightful! We ordered their velvety rich green tea ice cream to finish which was better than most I've had. I think I may have been so bold to say that "this is the best green tea ice cream I've ever had."
Alex S.}Richmond, VA}0}5}0}-1}1}8/1/2010}I love hot pot and I've had some good (mostly homemade) and bad, but this is by far the worst place I've ever been to. Never going here again!1. Waiter only filled our glasses half full and never came again to check up on us, pour more water, and forgot half our order.2. Hot pot broth tasted... very off. At one point, my tongue was tingling from something in it. It also was boiling so much that the water was splashing out. It just didn't taste very fresh.3. If you eat the bubble tea inside the restaurant, they give you about half the amount. The only good thing here was the cream cakes. I would suggest not eating at the restaurant but maybe getting the bubble tea out (which tasted OK) and the cream cakes.
Wan L.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}4}7/24/2010}Unfortunately, my friends have a bit of a one track mind and every time I go here I ended up eating shabu shabu. I really wanted to try to sukiyaki and nabe, but another bad point about this restaurant is that you do not get individual hot pot and have to share therefore they do not serve one servings.I ate the prime rib shabu shabu set and though the proportion looks small, it is very filling. They give you rice, salad or soup, veggies, and udon along with the meat and utensils to scoop out the floating waste that comes from the meat. Everything is delicious. Near the end, they provide a small soup cup with salt and pepper(?) so you can put the shabu shabu water base in and drink it up since the water should have absorbed all the meat flavor. Me being very Asian used the soup to ea my udon. You get ice cream as dessert and I would suggest the red bean - creamy and divine.I also tried their duck and teriyaki(?) squid. OMG, they were so good. Highly recommended.Recommendation: Make sure to come with someone who wants the same thing as you or you will end up arguing whether to eat shabu shabu, sukiyaki, BBQ, or nabe.
Kas T.}Calgary, Canada}108}199}133}18}5}7/18/2010}LOVE the eel bibimbap!!!!!:)
Mo C.}New York, NY}9}28}75}-1}5}7/17/2010}The food here is really good especially the Prime Eye Beef. The restaurant itself is clean. I love the setting and the design of the place. Very cute. The rest room is also very clean which in my book deserves another star! The most important thing is their service! Everyone was so polite and nice. Extremely helpful and fun to be around! Even though I came here on a hot ass summer day (95 degrees) I'll do it again! I'll be bringing more friends here especially in the winter time!
Jae J.}New York, NY}88}84}13}-1}5}7/8/2010}This is the Best Shabu Shabu in NYC!  Always fresh vegetables and high quality meat. The place is a bit small but it's not necessarily a bad thing.  Great selection on the menu, great service, and intimate atmosphere.  They also have some decent happy hour specials.  You can only make a reservation with a party of 6 or more and cause there seems to always be a long line for dinner.  Best advice- get there for an early dinner, otherwise you'll have to patiently wait like everyone else (but def worth it).  At least they have bench outside...or just wander about the East Village...
Michelle Q.}New York, NY}53}88}0}-1}5}6/24/2010}I've been wanting to try this shabu shabu restaurant for a while.  But their notorious long wait intimidates me.  The only time I waited in line for longer than an hour was the zac posen for target debut..and to be honest it wasnt even worth it.  Ok back to the restaurant - my gfs and I finally had the opportunity to try this place last week.  They take reservation for party of 4! It was one of those hot humid summer day, but the restaurant inside provides really good AC that makes us feel comfortable to eat hot pot in this 90 degree weather.  We all ordered the prime rib eye (according to all the yelpers recommendations) and I totally agree - the meat quality is superb!  I also enjoyed the veggies.  The portion was perfectly enough for us.  We even had some left overs in the soup.  I'm so happy that I found my shabu shabu match in the city!
Anastasiya G.}New York, NY}8}19}0}-1}4}6/9/2010}Good experience. Cute east village atmosphere of you like that sort of thing. However, I did ask for extra kimchi and was not told that this sour cabbage would be an extra 6 bux .... It's cool it get it but I would just appreciate it if you told me. Thought this place would run a bill of 60 tops! (party of 2) ended up being $100.    I might come back but not asking for extra kimchi! Haha
Philip W.}Brooklyn, NY}107}21}0}-1}4}5/20/2010}Fantastical...Beef Rib eye slow cooked in water with mixed vegetables and a huge BEER.. I think it was about 32 oz.. not sure though.. either way.. very genuine experience.Stumbled out of there with a nice clean fill, and a great attitude. Recommend it for groups, first date, and practicing Japanese. Advice: Do not touch the middle..Until next time we swim in beef and veggies,PWILDE
pisa w.}New York, NY}3}9}12}-1}4}5/12/2010}Go after midnight on Friday and Saturday for its Night Bird Special!!!  Trust me... it's a lot cheaper!But for the Night Bird Special you can only choose between Shabu-Shabu and Yakiniku.  I haven't tried the yakiniku here yet but I have tried the shabu-shabu and the sukiyaki.  Both are good.For those of you who complained about the blandness of the shabu-shabu broth, this is an authentic Japanese version!  Dip your meat in the sauces and get that flavor.  But if you still insist you want more flavor in your broth, go have Chinese/ Taiwanese hotpot or go to other less authentic Japanese shabu-shabu places!The meat portion is actually too small for me.  That's why it's good to come for the Night Bird so you could order extra meat without breaking the bank.  After you're done with your shabu-shabu, they will give your a small bowl with tiny bit of salt so you could put the broth (which is no longer flavorless) and the rice in and eat it at the end... or at least that was how I thought I should do with that bowl.I usually prefer sukiyaki anyway so I came to try its sukiyaki as well.  It was good.  For sukiyaki, the broth has flavor and you get no sauce.  You're supposed to dip your meat into a raw egg yolk and eat it.  Those are why I love sukiyaki.  It's sweeter than shabu-shabu and I love the egg. Place is small so make reservation or come during off hour.
Terren J.}New York, NY}82}313}64}-1}5}4/25/2010}Shabu shabu for dinner? Uh oh, am I going to be hungry afterwards?Had dinner here w/ the girls and we were full. Love the prime rib eye shabu set. It comes w/ salad, a plate of large slices of meat, a plate of veggies, noodles, and tofu, rice, ice cream, and some kind of hot tea. The quality of the meat is good. The green tea ice cream was a perfect ending to the meal.I'll definitely come back when I get my shabu cravings. Previously I only knew of Pho 32 for shabu (which sucks by the way). So glad I was introduced to this place. Make sure to make reservations because the place is small.  I also like that Chikalicious is conveniently down the street so I can go grab some extra desserts.
Darwin G.}New York, NY}276}954}67}18}4}4/21/2010}Great meal and I'm glad that they're until 1:30 on the weekends in case your dinner plans run late.To start off, we had the beef tongue bibimbap, in which the waiter worked the egg into it and I mean he worked real hard mixing it up before serving.The yakinuki (almost identical to Korean BBQ) for two is more than enough food. Starts off with a salad. They give a cheese and corn mix to help on the grill. The platter comes with mix of prime rib, chicken liver, tight, and vegetables accompanied with multiple sauces.This also comes with little appetizers to nibble on.To top it off, a large scoop of amazing green tea ice cream, which actually tasted like tea and not over sweetened.
Poyz C.}Newark, DE}0}23}78}-1}4}4/18/2010}The prime-rib eye Shabu Shabu is the BEST! Very tender. The staff are very nice; ask them if you don't know how to do the Shabu Shabu or Sukiyaki. Another good thing about this place is that it opens really late at night. Ask for special price at midnight if you are a late-night person.
Phung N.}Milpitas, CA}265}109}2}-1}2}3/24/2010}"No Spicy Miso?"My friend and me was looking forward to having shabu-shabu for the first time with each other.  The experiences she had, made me want try it so bad.  I tried Shabuway in Mountain View, CA.  Yes, this was amazing compared to Shabu-Tatsu.  Why?Flavors:Shabuway had two types of broths.  Spicy Miso Broth and the original Seaweed Broth.Shabu-Tatsu had only Seaweed Broth -  I should call it Seaweed Water because That's what it tasted like actually, like Bruce Lee's favorite drink - WATAH!The Spicy Miso has so much more flavor than then Seaweed water...I am a spicy type of person so this can be one sided... or not...Condiments:Shabuway had freshly cut green onions, garlic, kim chi paste?(smelt like kim chi), hot oil, and the mixed peppers...Shabu-Tatsu had only garlic, kim chi paste, and hot oil...Again, this allows you to adjust the flavors to your liking.  We didn't have much to work with to adjust the broth...PORTIONS!:Shabuway had twice as much food, but for half the price...  They used kobe beef as well!Shabu-Tatsu gave us only one plate of meat which didn't come close to filling us up.  And there beef was only consider in the angus category...Kobe Beef vs Angus?  Half price for much more food?  What would you choose?In the end, we were still hungry but didn't want to spend the extra moola for a downgrade of quality in food...  We left and went for dessert and then filled up with a bottle of red wine after.  If you enjoy this place.  Come to California for higher quality of food for half the price...  You won't be disappointed.P.S. We were so disappointed with this place, when we got back to California.  I took my friend to Shabuway and she was so happy with everything.  She even said it beats her place in San Francisco...
Emily M.}New York, NY}134}285}45}-1}4}3/11/2010}yum yum yum. I'm obsessed with shabu shabu. i doubt that its specific to this restaurant; I'm a sucker for Asian hot pots of all kinds. this is traditional shabu, with very high quality delicious ingredients. i find it a bit pricey, but you get full way before you expect to. in addition to the shabu, i really like the bibimbop, and they prepare it at the table in the traditional way. the best part is after you're done cooking all of your ingredients in the pot, you add the broth to your bowl of salt and pepper and slurp away. the restaurant is very small, and they do not tolerate lateness for reservations. in fact, they don't tolerate much of anything, they're pretty rigid there. i remember one occasion when i was the first member of my party to arrive, and i was literally sweating and shaking with the pressure they were putting on me. they only act like that because they know the shabu is totally worth all the mistreatment they can dish (ladle) out.
Sharon Z.}New York, NY}484}114}158}-1}4}3/6/2010}Positives:- Prime rib steak was goooood- They only give you two sauce but those two sauces are extremely flavorful; better than I can make at those DIY sauce shabu shabu places- The rice..maybe it was just that one night, but that was the best rice I've ever had (and I eat rice like almost every day)- The green tea ice cream is rich in flavor. Definitely authentic and actually has a tea flavor to it- Staff was friendly and prompt. She let us have our cake and sit there for a while although there was still people waiting to be seatedNegatives:- A bit overpriced but I guess you could go get the late night deal- You'll have to wait a bit since it gets packed.The positives win!
Jen W.}Flushing, NY}99}407}190}-1}3}3/2/2010}Our friends had never tried this, and honestly I haven't either, so in we went. We didn't know what to expect. Service was decent, the staff was helpful in clearing out dishes and making sure you had everything. The shabu part itself, well its kinda bland, and they only give you 2 sauces, to dip in. The meat was kinda pricey, it was 22-24 per person. Granted it comes with a salad, rice and dessert. The red bean ice cream is really good, so get that one instead of the green tea, and you can always get vanilla elsewhere. We also tried the sukiyaki, which was way more tasty and amusing to watch with those giant chopsticks. It had way more flavor and was more enjoyable.The place itself is pretty small, and gets cramped and crowded pretty fast, so if you can, make a reservation.
LH T.}Brooklyn, NY}0}6}2}-1}5}2/14/2010}AWESOME interior. AWESOME portion for the price you pay. AWESOME service.   It can be a little pricey - Me & my boyfriend spent $80 including tips - but we left really pleased with the portions and definitely impressed by the level of service.
Johnny K.}New York, NY}4}77}0}-1}4}2/8/2010}Excellent shabu-shabu place in East Village. Great beef rib-eye and the veggies were good as well.  We had delicious sake (though I don't think you need to splurge for the expensive sake, which we had done to some degree -- I would get a more moderate one next time).  The duck appetizer and the pork gyoza dumplings were outstanding. I love that they finish your meal with ice cream and then tea.  Solid place all around I enjoyed the meal very much.  Would definitely go back.
David G.}Oakland, CA}2}93}2}-1}3}2/7/2010}In general I think Shabu Shabu is overpriced, but this place is not worth $25 a person. It's a small plate of veggies and some meat. They don't even have broth or oil or anything like that. It's just water with a little seaweed flavoring bouillon thing. I got better shabu shabu in China town for half the price and got twice the amount of food.
minnie c.}Los Angeles, CA}4}5}0}-1}1}1/24/2010}went here today with some friends to have shabushabu. i've been here before many times and enjoyed it. however, today we had a surprise waiting for us... they get the table ready, we order, then they open up the hole in the center of the table for the shabushabu and we see a MOUSE inside!!! yes, a MOUSE!!! yes it was alive and moving around... we freak out and tell the staff and they just say "omg, we will give you a diff table". but we were so grossed out we just had to leave the restaurant... i used to work in restaurants so i know all of them have their share of problems but actually seeing it like that in your face was too disturbing... i'm very sad bc i used to love going there. not sure if i can go again after that incident :( i don't know anymore how to rate this restaurant after what happened today... GAHHHH
Dela C.}Austin, TX}11}147}5}-1}4}1/18/2010}This nocturnal frugalista looooves a deal, so we went late night and got the "Night Bird Special".  This saved us cash and having to brave the crowds - yippee!  Strolling in at about 12:45,  I was happy to see that there were still several tables eating - not so busy that we had to wait, not so empty that we felt self conscious.  The deal is pretty swell: prime rib eye for $16pp, regular ribeye for $14pp.  The meat, veggies, and sauces were all mighty delish.   I haven't been during regular hours, so I don't know what the portions are like at full price, but me and my man ended up ordering an extra serving of meat ($9).  We probably could have done without it, but we were in a shabu-frenzy.  As I write this review, my mouth is watering. The true sign of a good-grub experience! Not sure which gets my vote for best shabu in the city at this point, here or Momokawa.  Arriving at the answer will require extensive swish-swishing and chomp-chomping.Yay for shabu-shabu!
Jenny J.}Brooklyn, NY}27}308}6}-1}4}1/13/2010}even with a reservation, there was a 15-20 min wait.  the wait itself wasn't really a problem because i was with great company, but since the "waiting space" was so tiny, the constant shuffling back and forth became rather uncomfortable for all of us especially with the cold wind coming through the door constantly.i ordered the prime rib shabu-shabu course.  it was well worth it.  sometimes i'd have hotpot at home and each package of thinly sliced prime rib we'd buy from mitsuwa would cost us $18-24.. the entire shabu-shabu course which included rice & veggies and dessert (ice cream) was in fact $24.i wish they'd kind of divide up the bbq and shabu shabu seating though.  when i'm dining on the latter, i don't really want to be smelling bbq.. it's distracting!!
Olivia L.}New York, NY}139}70}50}-1}5}1/11/2010}I had the Sukiyaki here, which I would recommend over the shabu shabu. Delicious broth, and enough food to leave you satisfied. Although, if you are used to American portions, do order a few appetizers. I would definitely return here with my friends!
anna a.}Escondido, CA}59}62}5}-1}4}1/9/2010}First I must say, either make a reservation or get there at opening. We got there at opening with 5 people and all tables were reserved, we had to squish into a booth.We ordered everything under Shabu menu: pork, chicken, prime beef, beef, and shrimp. They also bring a heaping plate of cabbage, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, carrots, etc. One of the most fun way I've eaten. You take your chop sticks and your thin cut of meat and you swish it around in the water until it cooks how you prefer, then dip it into one of two sauces, I believe one was a sesame sauce and the other like a ginger (correct me if I'm wrong).Small location but great food! Too bad they don't have big tables for groups.It's about $22-24 per person for the Shabu. Comes with salad (tiny), the meat, and ice cream (red bean ice cream and green tea is amazing)
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}5}1/8/2010}The best Japanese Shabu Shabu spot in the city! I have been to a handful of Shabu Shabu spots, this one is hands down the best. Its always busy and the meat is always quality. The aromas from all the different pots cooking in the restaurant makes it a comfortable spot on a cold winter night. The vegetables are vibrant in color and they taste better than they look. I love sharing a table with friends and adding different ingredients together!
Athena C.}San Francisco, CA}925}1562}681}18}4}1/8/2010}Hot spot for Shabu Shabu in the city. Very cute decor with tatami floor and paper windows. The quality of the hot pot meat is very high. I like how this restaurant is very clean and service is fast. Came here with two of my girlfriends and we ordered the prime rib set and were full without ordering anything extra. It also comes with ice cream as dessert last. One tip though, if you want to savor the soup after you finish the meal, don't add more water to it as it dilutes down the broth. Finally, there is almost always a long wait at nights, especially weekends. Therefore, be sure to have patience coz it is worth it!
Erika H.}New York, NY}36}107}4}-1}5}1/4/2010Updatedreview}Also: THIS IS A JAPANESE SHABU SHABU PLACE. That means the broth you cook the meat in is flavored only with dashi and the only real flavor you get is from the ponzu and goma-dare. If you can't deal with simple flavors you should look elsewhere.I'm kind of pissed that someone reviewed this place badly after expecting a Korean shabu shabu; that's super different, and should be treated as such.
Jh M.}San Jose, CA}26}181}6}-1}3}12/29/2009}this place is good.  but that's it: good.  i wouldn't call shabu-tatsu supreme or THE best.  however, it did make it nice that we ate here on a frigid winter NYC night.  meat was fresh, nice that they included tea and ice cream - but there are some major things this place needs:  different flavored broths, daikon, and NO RESERVATIONS.  a place this small should NOT be taking reservationsbeing a bay area cali guy, i've had just as good shabu and i have still yet to eat at a place as good as zabu zabu in berkeley, ca.  hit it up if you're in the area
Victor C.}Maspeth, NY}563}27}21}-1}4}12/27/2009}Although I haven't been here in awhile, I remember it as it was yesterday because the food was awesome! I didn't come here for the Shabu Shabu though, I came here for the Sukiyaki! My first experience of Sukiyaki was at Lan but then they took it off their menu and left me craving so after some research I found Shabu Tatsu! For those of you not familiar with Sukiyaki, it's similar to Shabu Shabu but the only difference is the food would be cooked in a Sukiyaki sauce instead of broth. If you haven't tried it yet make sure you do! I would say it is definitely a fun first date if none the less a delicious meal to warm you up in this brisk NYC winter weather!
Anne L.}Los Angeles, CA}10}77}3}-1}5}11/7/2009}Love the " Selected Special Shabu-Shabu" (meal A)!  Diana G. sums it up nicely!
Diana G.}Boston, MA}60}212}95}-1}5}11/4/2009}Reasons I am giving this restaurant 5 stars: 1. Stays open late. (11pm on the weekdays, and 1am on the weekends) 2. There is a place to sit outside while you wait for your table. 3. Very friendly and attentive service. 4. Excellent menu choices for shabu-shabu & Japanese BBQ. 5. Big portion for the price. Shabu shabu comes with salad, meat of choice, big plate of veggies, 2 kinds of noodle, rice, and ice cream for dessert. 6. For first-time diners, an explanation of how to eat shabu shabu (and what all of the veggies & sauces are) will be provided. 7. This is not a big touristy restaurant with all the hustle & bustle. This is a small neighborhood restaurant with only about 10 tables. You will have to wait for a table, but it will be worth it. Excellent place to wind down, refuel, and enjoy the company of friends or family. I took my sister here the other night for her first shabu-shabu experience, and she thoroughly enjoyed it! Afterwards, we noticed on our bill that we were charged for one extra beer by accident, and when the waiter adjusted the bill, he also gave us 2 more drinks on the house! I thought that was very generous. I would go back to this place in a heartbeat, but next time, I will first make a reservation! :D
Nari L.}New York, NY}96}50}7}-1}2}11/3/2009}I'm just going to start off by saying.. i have a huge obsession with shabu-shabu.   Okay, i'm not sure how to put this but, 'korean' shabu-shabu.  I studied abroad 3 years ago in South Korea, and that's actually when I first had shabu-shabu (at a restaurant).  And wow, I was in love.  I kid you not- I think I ate it 3 times a week for 2 months.  I was utterly in AWE of this stuff.  And the craziest thing was, I never got sick of it.  So, I travel back to the States and am instantly depressed because I couldn't have this amazing thing anymore.  Naturally, I ventured out for the different types of shabu-shabu I could find here.  I tried various types of shabu-shabu- hot pot, pho 32, Shabu-tatsu etc...I know ShabuShabu is really a Japanese thing, so I thought that shabu-tatsu would be the best.  I mean, maybe even better than the one in Korea.  Honestly, I was soooooo disappointed.  Seriously...what!??!?! @.@  The thing is, yea it does have a clean taste.  Uhm... a little TOO CLEAN.  The broth is just water.  Water with a piece of dashi in it.  Seriously, do they think this is going to flavor anything?  (sorry i'm not trying to bash, but i was just really sad)  But basically, you are dipping all your meats and veggies into a big pot of water.  The only flavor you really get is from the 2 sauces they provide.   Sesame and Ponzu.  I know Japanese people love ponzu and everything.. but these 2 sauces weren't enough.  Actually, I started to get sick of them.I know I sound like a crazy Korean girl but.. I ordered kimchi and added that to the pot.  We were the only ones to have a odd-colored broth.  (My friend Mina was quite embarassed about this, but I insisted we needed flavor..which she agreed on)  I don't know if it's traditional to have a bland broth, but the one's I had in the past used Vegetable broth, or something with flavor.  Sigh:::  I mean, I still ate the whole thing.  The one thing that is really awesome was the quality of the meat.  I had the prime rib-eye special, the meat itself was absolutely delish (which is why I gave this place 2 stars). Oh yea and, i waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday night.Overall, disappointed and still looking for the best Shabu-shabu in town.  Any suggestions? Please message me!
Jewel Y.}New York, NY}121}767}3340}18}5}11/1/2009}Awesome yakiniku!!! As we Japanese would say, "BAKA-UMA!!!" So authentic and delicious, reminded me of yakiniku I had in Japan!! Had I known that a place like this existed long time ago, I would've come here more often!! Man I feel like I've been missing out a lot for so long!!  The assorted Meat BBQ combo for 2 people for $49 is a steal, this is such an amazing value!!!!  It comes with 8 appetizers like Korean BBQ restaurants consisting kimchi, kakuteki, namul, spinach, sweet & sour radish, etc., soup, rice, 4 different kinds of meat (beef, tongue, liver, chicken thigh and vegetables), and ice cream. The BBQ comes with 4 different dipping sauces and you grill your own meat. We left this place feeling totally satisfied and happy. I'm gonna ditch my Korean BBQ restaurant and start coming here now!
Emma L.}Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY}137}373}168}-1}5}10/23/2009}Japanese Shabu Shabu is a lot more refined and "cleaner" than Chinese hotpot.  There isn't much of a decision making process because you either choose A, B, or C.  Don't let the lack-there-of options fool you, each option is filled with an oasis of meats, sauces, vegetables, noodles, and then more.  We ordered two orders of the sukiyaki and two orders of shabu shabu and miscellaneous sides and drinks for a party of 5, after the massive meal, we felt we could have shed one order less of the sukiyaki or shabu.  There isn't an awkward bump in the way Shabu Tatsu serves its meals at all, it completely delivers.  There isn't one thing where keeps you saying "ahh the soup is drying out... oh wait, they left a pitcher and sukiyaki sauce with big spoon on the table to solve this".... or after your awesome shabu meal all your'e left with is the plain water broth (w/ some flavoring w/ the aftermath) you might find yourself saying "how are they going to expect us to drink this soup? it looks so bland? oh wait, the bowls with handles that have given us have salt (or soup base flavorings) at the bottom of each bowl".  See, they thought of everything!  And that, I completely appreciate.I've made a rule for myself regarding Shabu Tatsu, and is NEVER to come back without a party of 4 because they only take reservations for 4+.  And if you come with less, expect to wait for more than 30mins in the cold (I don't assume people eat here when it's Summer?) because there are only about 8 tables in this joint.  Grab a couple of friends and phone in a reservation... it is completely worth it.
Daphne H.}San Francisco, CA}78}444}18}-1}4}7/12/2009}I've been here twice. Once for Shabu Shabu and recently this weekend with Jeff P for Sukiyaki - served for 2, this makes for a good meal.Good service - they cook for you initially and then its DIY and ice cream is included. We got the prime steak sukiyaki and a carafe of sake. Mmm..
Caesar R.}Somerville, MA}918}946}20}-1}4}7/9/2009}For my first Shabu-Shabu experience I would say, I'm a fan.  Just not when it is 80 degrees outside.  You certainly get a facial experience sitting in front of that boiling cauldron for your meal.  I like the food.  The GF and I enjoyed the prime steak shabu-shabu.  All the vegetables and rice that come along too.  You get ice cream included for dessert, but we skipped it and went to a more dessertcentric type of place.  It was quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Will most certainly go back when cooler temperatures prevail.
Amanda B.}Taipei, Taiwan}48}202}19}-1}4}7/7/2009}food: ordered the prime-steak shabu shabu, happy-hour free draft sapporo, and extra special ice-cream dessert. ambiance: good spacing of seats, dim but not too dark.price: fair.service: great. despite the fact there weren't a lot of customers, the waiters were attentive and very polite.today was a special festive day in all japanese, korean, and chinese cultures.the legend is about a love story.so after our great shabu shabu meal of complete satisfaction, the waiter tells us that the icee-cream today comes with red bean paste and sticky rice-balls to celebrate the reunion of this legendary couple.well, hooray for us.i personally don't usually like red bean paste... or ice cream.but today i devoured my dessert faster than my pal who usually waits a half hour for me to finish my food (slow eater, good for health), even though i was so stuffed i could feel the shabu shabu trying to make its way up my esophagus.will i return?YES, I WILL.
Victor T.}Austin, TX}24}225}62}-1}4}6/18/2009}Not a bad place to have Shabu-shabu. The gf and I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table on a Saturday night, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.As-far-as the food goes, it was a decent portion of meat, and the accompanying items (noodles, greens, and etc) were just the right amount.I would eat here again and again, but the gf and I lament that for the same price we could have all you could eat Shabu-shabu at one of our favorite Tokyo restaurants. $1300 for a flight to Tokyo sounds tempting right now:-)
Mimi W.}Los Angeles, CA}211}225}17}-1}3}6/18/2009}The minute I sat down, I was turned off by this place. The cover of the menu warned that there was a $40 minimum for each table. That's like putting your registry on the invitation, dear (just plain rude). First of all, $40 isn't hard to hit, even for a table of two at Shabu-Tatsu. Most people will hit it, Shabu-Tatsu, you don't need to put it on the menu and make people feel awkward and/or hate you for it. I did, however, enjoy their happy hour deal where, if you order the shabu shabu or bbq, you get a free drink (wine, soda, beer). I dine like an old person (ie extremely early) so I am always happy to be rewarded for it. The shabu shabu itself is okay; food quality was good, Sapporo was good, ice cream was good. Nothing blew my mind. I do, however, have to wonder what kind of shabu shabu would knock my socks off because it's the best restaurateur-friendly (and poor-cook-unfriendly) concept ever. "Hey guys, let's open a restaurant ... but let's make the patrons cook their OWN food!"
Emil C.}Mountain View, CA}12}31}0}-1}5}6/15/2009}I eat here on a regular basis, my favorite restaurant of all time. If they would let me, I would live in the restaurant so I could have easy access to Shabu Shabu.The meat is especially tender here, I'm not sure what they do to it... or if they have some really good beef supplier. I think they also add some sake or cooking wine to the sesame sauce, it's a nice touch.They also have sapporo on tap!
Helena Z.}Brooklyn, NY}48}264}0}-1}5}6/6/2009}Fun shabu shabu place-- everything was delicious!! The appetizers were amazing.
Rahul G.}New York, NY}102}130}0}-1}4}5/28/2009}Shabu-Tatsu has figured it all out! They make you do all the work, and you still leave super duper happy.  I need to learn that trick.I've got to say, this was WAY better than Gyu Kaku. The ambience is cosy and the food portions are enormous!  We got the beef and chicken w/rice, kimchi, and three sauces (mustard, sweet, spicy) as well as the tofu bibimbap.  The meat was so fresh and tender, and they make the bibimbap at your table, so its piping hot and not to mention, unbelievably delicious!  At the end of the meal, I thought my stomach was going to explode, but then the waiter told me ice cream comes with the dish COMPLIMENTARY.  I don't pass up anything free (even though I know its not really free).  So we ordered the chocolate and vanilla ice cream, and really pushed our belly limits.  Thankfully I wasn't wearing a belt that night or I would have shamelessly loosened it.All the delicious belly limit pushing for $28/person.  Borat say I laaaaiiiikkke.
Nicole S.}Athens, GA}128}140}23}-1}4}5/19/2009}I hadn't done Shabu in years and I thought it would be a fun dinner out with some out of town friends.  I was so pleased that my memory of this delicious and fun dinner was just as good as I remembered. To begin, this restaurant is lovely and you feel as though you're transported to Japan (well, if Japan was in the East Village).  We started out with some pitchers of Sapporo, a deal at $17 a pitcher, a couple bowls of Edamame and some Teryaki Tofu - which was piping hot and perfectly executed. For dinner we decided to do a little barbecuing and then some shabu hot pot.  We started with the mixed fish and meat BBQ with three dipping sauces.  Everything came out well, despite our lack of experience on the table top grill.  The dipping sauces, a spicy, sweet, and mustard were a lovely compliment to the char grilled tender meats and fish.  The shabu shabu was certainly the highlight for all of us.  The thinly slices of prime rib and pork cutlets were delicious quickly cooked in our broth of cooking veggies.  The miso sauces were a wonderful compliment to the perfectly cooked meats and veggies.  Afterward, our homemade stock pot was delightful with our noodles and seasoning as a wonderful soup.  And even though we were stuffed, we still managed to scarf down a nice dish of ice cream and finish our beers. The bill came and for the 6 of us, a couple pitchers of beer, mixed grill for two, shabu shabu for two, several appetizers, a delicious fried rice dish, plus the other little extras such as rice, salad, and ice cream, the meal came out to $50 including tip each!  What a steal!  Not only that, it was a huge hit with my out of town friends and reminded me what a fun and delightful dinner Shabu Shabu can be.  I will definitely do this again soon!
Jim K.}Brooklyn, NY}8}116}4}-1}3}5/19/2009}Yummie and fun. My first shabu shabu experience and I'd do it again. First a warning: skip the bbq and go straight for the shabu shabu. We had a party of four and started with bbq for 2 followed by shabu shabu for 2. The bbq wasn't that great. The meat was sliced too thick and large and was chewy and hard to get through. On the other hand, the shabu shabu was great (of course, by this point, we'd made our way through 2.5 bottles of wine so I my judgment could have been a little clouded). What's better than pounds of flash-boiled beef and veggies with dippin sauce! Mmmmm dippin sauce!
N. R.}New York, NY}6}89}9}-1}5}4/15/2009}Who am I kidding? I tackled hefty amounts of restaurants that carries shabu-shabu in their menu, but nothing is ever as good as Shabu Tatsu. While Tatsu offer $24 per person on their prime rib beef, most other restaurants charges you $35 with less meat. Also, the $24 comes with salad and yummy ice cream to finish. Couldn't get better than that.I guess I was just fooling around with other shabu restaurants just to prove myself and other yelpers that there are better shabu-shabu in the city. I gave up... You guys are right... Shabu Tatsu is GOLDEN!! Oh and the waitress, she's hella cute... Tee-hee!
Amanda S.}New York, NY}52}152}0}-1}3}4/15/2009}Apparently it's one of the best shabu shabu places in NYC...but it was just OK for me.  Their entree sets could have had more variety, and the prices didn't have to be that high.  We each paid about $35+.  Come on, I grew up eating this at home...$35 worth of meat can feed the entire fam.  I'll come back again, but it's not going to become my go-to restaurant for shabu shabu.
ashley h.}Austin, TX}4}19}0}-1}5}3/27/2009}swish! swish! Shabu Tatsu is what dreams are made of.  Mouth wateringly delicious!
julie K.}New York, NY}12}4}2}-1}5}3/23/2009}This was my first time having shabu shabu and now I'm addicted. We got two orders of prime rib eye and we left completely stuffed and satisfied. The meat and veggies (watercress, spinach, and cabbage) were fresh and the miso dipping sauce was awesome (much tastier than the soy sauce based one). The small scoop of red bean/green tea ice cream was the perfect end to a rather hot meal. The only drawback was the wait but it was definitely worth it.
Max S.}New York, NY}3}58}0}-1}4}2/28/2009}Had a great dinner here last weekend. It is a lot of fun cooking your own food and the waiter was really helpful in helping us first-timers pick what we wanted and teaching us how best to cook the food. It's not cheap but it's not that expensive considering all you get with your meal. I would definitely return.
Thu V.}New York, NY}105}117}0}-1}4}2/19/2009}Really, I want to give it a 4 1/2.  This is the best Shabu Shabu place on the island.  Hands Down.  But homemade Shabu Shabu is always the best, and yelp doesn't allow me to rate my own Shabu Shabu ;)To order, you need a minimum of 2 orders, but this really does feed about 3-4 people, but we were able to eat it all with just the 2 of us.  You will be stuffed.  Dinner for 2 (includes salad and dessert) with a pitcher of beer plus tip = $80.  Really good price.The wait could be well over an hour.  I like to get there around 6:30ish, put my name down, go to the Thirsty Scholar or any bar for a drink or 2, then call back in to check on the wait time.  The main room has the hot pots IN your table, but they do have 3 tables downstairs with the hot pot on TOP of your table.  Try to get the seats on the main floor though.We always get the Prime Rib Eye and Pork Shabu Shabu.  Really fresh cuts of meat sliced perfectly thin to cook in the water.  You also get slices of mushrooms, tofu, carrots, chinese broccoli, and noodles to put in.  The 2 sauces are already made for your dipping and a nice steaming bowl of rice.My only complaint is that they only use boiling hot water.  I like a real broth at the end to slurp with my noodles.  Even though it is technically a broth after all of your meat and veggies have been cooked and they do add salt and pepper in the soup cups to give the water some extra oomph.
Maria L.}Brookline, MA}71}20}0}-1}5}2/18/2009}I've been here more times than I can remember and Shabu Tatsu never dissapoints. Some things you should know:They don't take reservations unless you are a group of 4 or more. So if you are not, get ready for a 45 minute wait.The food is amazing. The service is great. The ambiance is great for a group of friends to get together over a communal pot of shabu.
Jo K.}New York, NY}267}494}313}18}4}2/13/2009}shabu-tatsu usually has a long wait but it's so worth it! i've come here at least 2 dozen times and i love the quality of their meats and the yummy vegetables like the cabbage and mushrooms that you leave in the broth. The dipping sauce is delish and towards the end they bring you cups with seasoning in it and you can add the broth and drink it!  So yum! they also give you a complimentary ice-cream at the end and i love the red bean and green tea. it's standard high quality shabu-shabu.For appetizer,  I also like getting the "yook hae with egg" which is a korean dish of semi frozen raw meat, seasoned in sesame oil and a yummy sauce, with raw egg on top of it.  after mixing, you eat it along with the chopped up apples that come with it.  i know what you're thinking.. wtf? raw meat and raw egg yolk? It's basically korean steak tar tar!  if you have the guts, try it!! it will change your life!
Nikki F.}San Francisco, CA}20}128}0}-1}4}2/12/2009}best shabu shabu this side of the mississippi, probably.  thin cuts of quality meat, lean yet perfectly balanced with the right amount of fat. perfect sauces, especially the pink radishy one. only downside is a generic point about shabu shabu in general - the scum that rises to the top once you've cooked a few pieces..... but whattya gonna do.brisk yet perfect, almost undetectable service.  (ah, the japanese!)  the basic  shabu shabu will please, but don't be afraid to indulge, and to veer off the shabu shabu only menu.  their fried chicken and other cooked japanese treats are surprisingly good.
Renee C.}Vancouver, Canada}402}613}115}-1}3}2/8/2009}The shabu-shabu ingredients are really fresh! I came with a group of 7 girls, ordered all A.B,C,D,E combos of their shabu-shabu plus a beef bimbimbap....and we were so full! It comes with a lot of fresh vegies, 2 different kinds of noodles...2 dipping sauces and rice....and @ the end there was ice cream! it came to about $28/p. The broth is just water with 2 pieces of kelp...It's a good way to enjoy all the real tastes of the fresh ingredients...not like how chinese hot pot is where the broth usually is the most important aspect. I liked the dipping sauces, very simple. The bimbimbap is really good too!
D N.}New York, NY}18}116}0}-1}5}2/8/2009}I love this place. The two person minimum for shabu shabu feeds 3-4 people and everytime I've brought friends here- they've always enjoyed it.The bibimbap is fantastic- especially the eel one. The service is always friendly and they've always been incredibly patient when my party can't decide on what to get.I've also had the Yakiniku which comes with the best grilled fish.I totally recommend this place.
Natalia C.}New York, NY}7}31}0}-1}4}1/12/2009}Japanese hotpot is a lot of fun and the ingredients are very fresh here.  I've been several times and have always walked out very satisfied.  An order of the prime beef tends to be filling enough for me, but, if you are concerned that you will leave hungry, it is worth starting off with an order of their bee bim bop.  It is the best I've ever had.  My Korean friend is very picky about her bee bim bop and finds that this is the best she's ever had in New York (and I mention this because she certainly has more experience with bee bim bop than I). The wait for a walk in can be rather long and the foyer too tiny to keep warm, so plan on bundling up in the winter or kill time browsing some of the cute shops on 11th street.
tara t.}New York, NY}20}55}0}-1}5}1/6/2009}me and my boyfriend love shabu shabu! we come here in the winter time and always have a good time. i brought a couple of my friends here and now they love shabu too . i was told to go here by one of my japanese friends ,  i havent been here since last winter and now im going to have to go tomorrow.
Vicki Z.}New York, NY}29}133}64}-1}4}1/4/2009}One of my fav restaurants. very traditional Japanese hotpot place. they only accept reservation for 4+ ppl and it's a bit pain to wait in a hot pot place since hotpot is very slow to finish. be patient...
Sun M.}San Francisco, CA}11}85}0}-1}5}12/23/2008}At one point, i was going here almost weekly. The shabu is the bomb. It always satisfies my appetite... especially in the cold winter weather. The bibimpop is also delicious (one of the bests i've ever had). Its true that i haven't tried too many shabu places and there is a risk that shabu snobs will not find it good enough.. but this place always made me happy on a cold day!
Michael S.}Castro Valley, CA}15}226}22}-1}3}12/17/2008}I'm not a huge fan of Shabu, but this place is clean and fresh. The veggies were all fresh, nothing wilted or browning. All the meats/shrimp were fresh. If you like Shabu, this place is clean.
Tina C.}Queens, NY}1914}4023}9331}18}4}12/17/2008}A quaint Japanese shabu-shabu restaurant that perfectly warms patrons in the coldest weather.  The portions are generous for a party of two.  The thick egg noddles are my favorite.  There is only one uni-sex restroom due to space constraints.  The pot for the shabu-shabu is not deep which is good so patrons can monitor what is being cooked and the quantity of food put in.  There is one pot per table for parties to share which makes the dining experience engaging and conversational.  For partons who are NOT inclined to spicy hot foods, like myself, this restaurant fits one's taste buds.  The temperature for the pot to cook its contents is consistent throughout the entire meal.  The service is very attentive due to its size.  The plum wine is out of the world, which compliments the meal as my blind date requested two carafes.  I was jugging the plum wine like water exposing my bubbly personality while blushing to my blind date.  This is one of the better dates I've experienced although he arrived unavoidably five to ten minutes late but gets credit for making an appearance.  "Better late than never" always imbeds an impression that one attempts to make an appearance despite of tardiness.  Disappointedly the servings for ice cream is one minute scoop as it didn't fill my sweet tooth.  The business cards are printed on linen 80 lb. cover weight in citrus green Synergy as any hard core paper aficionado would easily recognize.  I do not recommend this restaurant for large group gatherings due to the size it would not accommodate.
Alice C.}San Francisco, CA}218}453}91}-1}3}12/15/2008}Took the boyf. here on his birthday for the shabu shabu. Between the two of us, we had a plate of beef, a plate of chicken, and a kind of small plate of veggies. The soup in the pot was clear, but they also gave us tiny bowls with seasoning on the bottom to make a small bowl of broth. And they provided us with two dipping sauces-- sesame and ponzu. Oh, and it also came with a salad before the food, and a small bowl of ice cream (I think the choices were red bean, green tea, strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla).We went around 5:30 when there was no one really inside, so the service was pretty decent. They were quick to bring the food and whisk away any dishes, and even quickly came to pick up a veggie I accidentally dropped on the ground (whoops).The total came out to be around $48 for the two of us. The food was good, but the price is pretty steep, considering we both left a little hungry! I'd much rather stick to Taiwanese-style shabushabu at Quickly's, where I can satisfy my craving for half the price and double the food.
Jean M.}Taipei, Taiwan}4}31}5}-1}4}12/6/2008}One of my favorite places to go to when I'm in the mood for some really good shabu shabu. The quality of the meat here is remarkable and the service is exellent. The only set back is the long wait because of limited seating. My advice is to go there before 6pm to avoid the crowd
Laur T.}New York, NY}26}780}0}-1}4}12/6/2008}It was an impromptu decision to come here. Fortunately we didn't have to wait very long for a table for 2. We had the prime rib-eye sukiyaki here. It was delish! I think I wanted to have the bimbimbap as well but guess we were too full to order more ;p
tiffanie n.}Brooklyn, NY}111}569}7}-1}4}11/24/2008}It is so cozy here, I love it.  I went here in the summer and recently in the fall.  I didn't enjoy it as much in the summer for obvious reasons. The steam from the hot pot was killing me. But it's nice to go here on a cold night.  I got the bibimbap and it was delicious, the best bibambap I've had in my short life on this earth.  And be careful, it really is hot...the waiter wasn't lying. My friends got the raw beef for shabu shabu...and that was really good too.  If you get the beef dish, it comes with red bean or green tea ice cream in the end. I also got the takoyaki appetizer, which was just alright, not as good as what you'd get at otafuku.  Also, do not get the cold green tea in the summer...it was really bad. I don't think they mixed it well, it was powdery.  I would definitely go back again.
Karina G.}San Jose, CA}161}289}26}-1}5}11/18/2008}Shabu Tatsu is so good that I'm craving this place all the way from the West coast.
Winnie H.}Brooklyn, NY}11}48}0}-1}4}11/15/2008Updatedreview}I'm not an expert of Dolsot Bibimbap so until I become a connoisseur, I'll follow these simple rules:1) Comes to the table sizzling hot in a large black stone pot.2) Rigorous mixing by the server.3) Hot chili pepper paste.4) Crispy little niblets of crispy rice. (Is niblets a word?)Tasty, crispy, hot and delicious. Unfortunately, it was not spicy. I like my bibimbap spicy and I guess either it's how they serve it here without the chili paste or the server forgot it. But it was still delicious. Must go back for shabushabu again when it's colder!
Tina L.}Dallas, TX}35}66}6}-1}3}10/28/2008}The shabushabu was delicious and we were seated instantly, but three stars because my judgment may have been affected by the fact that we had to wait FOREVER for the waitress to a) take our order and b) BRING US THE MEAT. So of course by the time we got the food, I was starving...at that point I could have eaten old sushi and I would have thought it was good. To be fair, when I was eating it at the time, I couldn't stop hmm-ing and ahh-ing that it tasted amazing, so maybe after I go back I'll bump up its rating.
Ernie K.}Dallas, TX}267}487}66}-1}3}10/23/2008}I have had Shabu-shabu at home for years so when I was told that I am having dinner there, I wasn't that thrilled.  Besides, I always thought it was just eh.  Nothing special and nothing really tasty.  And nothing really has changed after having dinner there.  It's just meat and veggie with two types of sauce (one tasted like mustard and the other seemed soy-based).  But then again, I guess it's the same with sushi.Anyway, it was good but I just am not a big fan of it.  Compared to other shabu shabu places I have been to (pho32 in ktown and one of mott st near hop kee), I have to say this probably was the best of all three.  Then again, my sample size is laughable.
Sam P.}New York, NY}1882}875}636}-1}4}9/18/2008}I first discovered the concept of Shabu-Shabu on a Yelp Team dinner in San Francisco not too long ago and fell immediately in love (cf this review for further effusive musings: yelp.com/biz/shabu-house…). I tend to be a big fan of anything that involves copious amounts of meat, but really I just like this whole concept.Heed to the tip that you should make a reservation if you've got more than 4 people, you don't want to have to wait in line - and this place is popular.  And why shouldn't it be?  For $24 you get a three course meal with tons of meat, veggies and rice that leaves you with a DELICIOUS broth for sipping when all your beef is cooked and gobbled.  Service is snappy and attentive. Decor is your typical East Village Asian place set-up.My only complaint is that they didn't seem to have any options for broth flavors other than plain old boiling water.  The spicy miso broth in SF was one of my favorite parts of the meal, and I was sad not to see it offered here.  But other than that, it's a great cheap way to get a lot of food, and a lot of fun.Oh, and btw, that's review #800, bitches.  Word.
Miriam W.}San Francisco, CA}3141}3141}2255}18}4}9/18/2008}Shabu-shabu means "swish-swish" but in my mind and my stomach it translates to "happy-happy."If you've got four or more folks in your party you can get a reservation (and trust me me you want one because peeps line up outside of Shabu-Tatsu!)From start to finish this meal was awesome. The pork dumplings, the meat, the veggies, the noodles, the tofu. . .And the little cups for broth at the end: a perfect way to cap off a terrific meal!When are we shabuing again?!
Kristina C.}Kihei, HI}36}204}24}-1}4}9/9/2008}Number of Food Inspection Violations*: 25 (A 28 is passing)Shabu shabu is best served on a cold day. The kind of day, where your toes are about freeze off. At least in Japan, that's how we got it done. And I haven't had shabu shabu in like 15 years, maybe more. And shabu-tatsu was a wonderful refresher course.The service was quick, the food was delish, and the meat was so good: not too much fat and lots of it!!! I would suggest getting a reservation because we got seated without any problems, and when we left, the line was out the door and down the block.But be warned, though remember folks it's New York, a friend of mine did see a mouse and one of the 25 violations was that there have been evidence of rats before. Now that doesn't sway me, especially because in NYC, rats are very common place when you're on the bottom floors. Plus, it was raining. Lots of creatures come in for shelter from the rain.Well, when I'm in town, I'm come back here fuh sho!*According to NYC DOHMH
Kimberli M.}New York, NY}124}422}156}-1}4}8/21/2008}Yum yum yum!!!I love the Shabu Shabu!Don't pass up on the Sak too!
Katie W.}Hillsboro, OR}28}40}0}-1}5}8/20/2008}I LOVED this place!  Kinda small and a bit of a wait, but well worth it!!!  The Sukiyaki was to die for...I can't wait to visit NY and go again!
James H.}New York, NY}395}119}4}-1}4}8/19/2008}I've long heard that this is the spot for shabu shabu in the city, but I opted instead for sukiyaki. Not sure what the difference is since both have thinly sliced meat, noodles and vegetables that are cooked at your table. Went with a friend who goes weekly and she suggested that I get a raw egg to use as a dipping sauce for all of the hot pot cooked goodness. As weird as using a raw egg as a sauce sounds, it was actually pretty flavorful and filling.I've never been a huge fan of shabu shabu since I tend to not like to work hard for my meal (except bbq), but I'd definitely go again and check out the other things on this extensive menu. I'd also suggest to go with a group of people like all places in St. Marks because it's no fun cooking for yourself!
vidor h.}Austin, TX}28}183}2}-1}4}8/5/2008}Good food, great service. great for small/ medium groups that are cozy with sharing food.  It's not exactly as good as Japan, but definitely satisfying. UES location was quieter, but it's gone now.
Goose M.}Oradell, NJ}82}88}4}-1}3}7/29/2008}Ate here last week, it was my first time having shabu. We got the basic setup as recommended by the waiter. When they brought everything out, it was quite confusing, but the waiter was very unpretentious, and gave us the run down despite him being very busy. A big complaint is that there was no AC in the place, and all the cooking at the table creates a lot of steam, which made us very sweaty. Make sure you get the selected prime rib-eye beef slices, not the normal... we got both, and it was a world of difference. So much more tender!! (though the weight conscious at out table liked the normal just cause it had less fat marbling)
Kristina W.}New York, NY}13}201}17}-1}4}7/28/2008}We had a good time here.  We tried the shabu-shabu, bi-bim-bap, and several appetizers (duck, pork belly, shrimp dumplings).  Everything was good.  The main dishes were better than the appetizers though.  The bi-bim-bap wasn't the spicy Korean style kind, but it was still very flavorful in its own way.  Everyone enjoyed the shabu-shabu.  For dessert, they gave us some ice cream which was a great closer.If you want a table, either make reservations a few days in advance or come before 7.
Chantelle D.}San Francisco, CA}324}467}135}-1}5}6/23/2008}My friends took me here last night for my birthday dinner. I literally could not have asked for a better meal, company or conversation (though we did get shushed by the table next to us so I guess they didn't enjoy our chatter quite as much as we did).Anyhow, we had some Shabu virgins in our midst so ordered the standard prime rib for everyone that also comes with salad, rice and ice cream for $20.95/per person. We also got an order of pork to mix it up. TONS of food, fresh delicious ingredients, we had a blast. Though I didn't peruse it too much, the menu looks like it also has a ton of other selections for your pot that I definitely plan to hit up sometime soon to try. I would love to come here on a date (anyone?) because not only is it affordable, but gives you something to chat about other than the weather - though with a big group of girls and a few beers, you certainly can't go wrong either.
Ting Ting L.}San Francisco, CA}18}43}0}-1}5}6/16/2008}I absolutely LOVE this place!The decor is pretty minimal but there is an intimate atmosphere, especially in the downstairs seating.I ordered the prime rib-eye shabu dinner both times - it comes with salad, noodles, veggies, meat and ice cream at the end. The sesame sauce is delicious. The whole meal only comes to a little more than $20 a person - a great deal considering the amount of food you get.Also, if you get the Sapporo draft, it comes in a HUGE mug (think 2L coke bottle...)
John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}5}6/16/2008Updatedreview}I've only had better shabu shabu in Japan.  Shabu-Tatsu so consistently rocks my world that I had to update it to 5 stars.
Adam R.}Asheville, NC}9}16}0}-1}5}6/4/2008}Very, very solid place. I've been there three times, and I haven't been dissapointed at all. Friendly, super-attentive service and excellent food at a very reasonable price. Intimate space that's basic but not spartan...and the hot pots make for great conversation, in the circumstance that you may be dining with marginal personality disorder.A go-to.
Denis K.}Manhattan, NY}70}376}87}-1}4}4/27/2008}I've never had Shabu Shabu before, unless you count the Melting Pot (which I think is pretty fantastic). So, when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner here, I was really looking forward to try some authentic Japanese shabu shabu. The restaurant is small, perhaps six or seven tables max. The atmosphere is rather cozy and the wooden interior lends a fairly warm feeling. The menu ranges from shabu shabu to sukiyaki to even korean bibimbap. Salad is served as a starter. It's pretty standard and pretty much from a salad mix bag. Nothing really outstanding. We ordered one prime rib eye shabu shabu and one chicken. The broth is water plus a piece of kelp (korean: dashima). I admit, I was kind of expecting some sort of stock for broth, but I suppose that isn't authentic. The vegetables consisted of cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, tofu, rice noodles, flour noodles, long scallions, and clovers (?). I can't speak for the rib eye, but the chicken was pretty good. It takes about 3 seconds to cook and was really tasty. I really enjoyed the ponzu shoyu sauce over the regular ponzu sauce. It was more tart and less of that sweet sesame taste. Dessert is included in your meal. Ice cream! Pick from red bean, green tea.. and a couple others. I had red bean. Usually I find red bean ice cream to be rather chalky in texture, but Shabu Tatsu managed to create a more creamy version. I was very pleased. Service is good. No complaints. Reservations are a must and make sure your entire party is there. We had our dinner reserved at 7:30 and we had to leave by 9:30 because there was another party set for that time. review 4/27/2008I.M.Y.
P W.}New York, NY}187}796}191}-1}4}4/20/2008}I had a huge yearning for ramen and had dinner plans with Kevin L. et al at Rai Rai Ken.  There was no way 7 people were going to fit in the 10 seat establishment so we ended up next door at Shabu-Tatsu. I had just finished up at Dos Caminos before coming here so I wasn't terribly hungry.  I was able to split the shabu shabu dinner for one with my cousin.  The dinner includes salad, rice, slices of prime rib-eye beef, veggies, two types of noodles and dessert.  I was looking forward to shabu-shabu since I've never done it before.  I've had plenty of experience with chinese hotpot, fondue and korean bbq.  This was very similar to chinese hotpot so it wasn't as a new of an experience as I would have hoped.I do have to say that the beef was top notch.  Probably because I flash boiled it so it was still red for the most part.  And the sesame sauce is amazing and tastes good on everything.  I also like that at the end, you're encourage to scoop some broth into a cup and drink as a soup.    Our waiter was really great.  Although I were splitting an entree for one, he offered to give us both our own sauces, gave us two bowls of rice, and remembered to give us a 2nd spoon for our dessert.  He was aware of our needs and the 4th star is for the good service.
Michael D.}Jackson Heights, NY}2381}347}110}-1}4}3/28/2008}I guess I forgot to write a review. I was here about six months ago with Rotardted Ro Ro.The food is very good. That is to say that the raw meat that they give you to boil is good quality. When I go to a restaurant and spend a fair amount of  money, I don't really want to boil it up myself. Should I help wash the dishes too?Cook my meat for me bitch!_____
Yosh H.}New York, NY}246}399}77}-1}4}3/26/2008}I was here not too long ago with friends and I gotta say, the food is great.  I highly recommend getting the bibimbap (I know, Korean food in a Japanese restaurant) because they way they make it is so good, I could eat a bowl just by myself.  Come with friends or just come alone.  You'll have a good time nonetheless.  Good service.  Just be warned, come during peak hours and there is a lengthy wait.
Joanna L.}New York, NY}197}360}234}-1}5}3/23/2008}I am thinking of you Eel Bi Bim Bap.Met with some friends at Shabu-Tatsu and was pleasantly surprised. Adorable interior, intimate environment... and really really good bi bim bap!!! 3 of the guys ordered 2 orders of shabu shabu and a bi bim bap to share and myself and a friend just ordered 1 bi bim bap (we had eaten some stuff earlier). I could've scarfed down a whole bi bim bap easily because it was DELICIOUS. The whole bill came out to $70 for 5 people. I say GREAT DEAL. Especially since it was DELICIOUS. I'd definitely go back!
Sha.Galli K.}New York, NY}0}6}1}-1}4}3/10/2008}I would give this place 5 stars but.......the shabu is average...it's good but trust me the sukiyaki is waaaayyyyy better..the sukiyaki deserves the five stars...so next time order the sukiyaki!! not the shabu!!
Noel R.}Brooklyn, NY}10}189}2}-1}4}3/7/2008}Been on a quest to find good shabu-shabu this winter but unfortunately Shabu-Tatsu has had to wait until now because of the long lines. When you're hungry a one hour wait is not attractive, especially in a neighbourhood with lots of good alternatives.However, finally made it and wasn't disappointed. The broth comes clear with just some seaweed (konbu) to start the broth off. Then comes the fun of plonking in all the goodies, starting with the veggies. Once they've started flavouring the broth start dunking the thinly sliced prime rib. Dunk to your taste but really it's only a matter of seconds. Dip the meat in sauces provided and enjoy. Delicious, and it's great to look around the room and see faces appear over their steamy pots. I actually enjoyed the fattier cuts of meat over the leaner.After polishing off everything a seasoned cup is provided for the broth which tastes delicious at the end.This is the tastiest shabu-shabu so far but it's also more expensive than others. I think the quality of the meat and the simple broth are the things that make this shabu-shabu better than others.
Andrew D.}Brooklyn, NY}780}582}227}18}4}3/5/2008}I've been here several times and I love IT!   I'm not crazy about shabu shabu, but I love the barbecue.  The meat was so delicious that it melted in my mouth.  The large bottle of Sapporo was the perfect complement.
Hideki K.}New York, NY}466}1079}310}-1}4}2/27/2008}Best Shabu Shabu in NYC (I've had so far)...I can't give it a 5 b/c I've been spoiled by Kobe beef shabu shabu in Japan.  I recommend Combo Set A with the Prime beef.  The broth is very tasty.
Hannah C.}Fort Lee, NJ}648}480}56}-1}4}1/18/2008}this place is really good and very filling. although i've only tried their sukiyaki all three times i've been there (soy sauce based not water based), it's definitely worth all the $20!!the servers are attentive and funny, the place can get pretty crowded at times and you might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it.
Josie A.}Oakland, CA}224}280}250}-1}5}1/12/2008}Delicious! Great cuts of beef, large prawns, and good veggies. The sauces are also tasty and the gyoza is yum. The wait can be pretty long because of the size of the place, but it's so worth it for the fun atmosphere and the good food!We ordered the some kind of combo for two that included boneless ribs, sliced beef, shrimp, salmon, and squid. It also comes with salad, pickled and fres veggies, ice cream, tea, and steamed rice for only $39 for two!
Ben K.}New York, NY}1}10}0}-1}4}1/6/2008}Meat is very good (order the premium). Veggie are plentiful and fresh.I see reviewer complaints of the broth being too bland...Guys, this is Japanese food, not cajun. The broth is made simply from boiling a strip of seaweed (konbu).Staff is attentive and polite. (except for that nasty manager whose attitude only changed after I switched from English to Japanese).Drinks. Variety to choose from. Calpico to tea to various high quality sake and beer. Wait is very long, especially on weekends including Sunday evenings. Try to make a reservation.PS - Don't over cook the meat until it shrivels into a tight wad of sinew and muscle fiber. You pick it up a slice of beef with chopsticks, dip in boiling water about 2-3 times swishing it around a bit and dip in ponzu (mixed with momiji (grated radish) and scallions) and enjoy! It's OK to eat slightly rare.
Eric C.}New York, NY}47}140}0}-1}3}12/15/2007}Got the prime sirloin dish.  The meat and veggies were fresh.  But seriously, I think I could've eaten 4x more meat than they served.  My friend and I carefully rationed out the meat attempting to savor each bite as we peered over at our neighbors' smorgasbord of korean bbq meats, bibimbap, kimchee, and soup.  We were jealous.After you're finished cooking the meat in the broth, they bring out a cup with a smattering of salt + pepper to drink the broth from.  A cup of black tea is brought out as well, and to finish it off, I had some green tea ice cream.This place gets 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 - half a star knocked off for portion size for a big eater like me (sorry, this is America, not Japan.)  The food is fresh and tasty, but prepared to wait a long time if you don't have a reservation.If you're ever in San Francisco, try Cafe Mums.  It's equally fresh and delicious, but for $30 you get all-you-can-eat shabu shabu and $10 more than that you get all you can drink beer + sake.  YEAH BOY.
Joy C.}Seattle, WA}55}95}0}-1}5}12/7/2007}What a great idea to have shabu shabu on a cold winter's night.  Yes, while there was quite a wait, it was still absolutely worth it.  My friend and I got the prime beef sukiyaki and it was delicious.  The meat was very high quality and fresh and you get a variety of veggies and other stuff (napa cabbage, vermicelli, noodles, mushrooms, onions, carrots, etc...)What I kind of wonder about though is why it still takes a long time to get your food.  I mean... you do all the cooking and all they have to do is chop everything up and bring it to you raw, which by the way is an ingenious idea for a business.  Maybe I should open a clothing store and just provide fabric and you can do your own sewing...Sadly to say, this is probably the most "cooking" I've done in the past few years.  But what do ya know, everything turned out great - must be because I'm an AMAZING chef.  Seriously, when is someone going to recognize my talent and give me my own Food Network show?
Marysa M.}New York, NY}9}21}0}-1}4}12/2/2007}I was introduced to hot pot recently and I must say there is something exciting about cooking your own food.  It's not terribly fun to get a steam facial while eating, but if you eat enough meat and drink enough sake you totally don't mind!  When I went on Friday with no reservations we just had to wait about 30 minutes.  We went to a nearby bar and came back in exactly 30 minutes and the table was all ready.  Since I am new to hotpot it's all good to me.  But I did think that the food was really fresh and the service was attentive. And ice cream is always a nice way to end the meal.  I will definitely be back to try some other stuff off their menu.
camilla c.}New York, NY}171}336}1}-1}4}10/8/2007}How I love shabu shabu... it's got an interesting combo of elements that you control to your liking.  The concept is fairly simple: cooking meat, veggies, and tofu in a boiling hot pot right at your own table.  Thus, shabu shabu ends up being a fun / communal meal and it's nice & filling but you'll never feel grossly full from it.  Given all of this, this review is partially just for shabu shabu itself, esp since there aren't too many places that serve this specialty. Shabu-Tatsu itself is a great authentic joint for this dish.  It's usually pretty crowded during shabu shabu season (whenever it's below 60 degrees outside); thus, there's been many a times I've resorted to going somewhere else for dinner given that wait time can usually run an hour or so during the "peak" season.  My advice is don't go during the middle of winter... go now, when it's fall and not everyone wants to cook meat in boiling water at their dinner table.  And when you go, by all means, order shabu-shabu.  You'll find other stuff on the menu, but there's really no point eating anything else here unless you're ordering it as a side to the shabu shabu.  I think their bi bim bop is pretty good but come on folks, when in Rome....I've had bad shabu shabu and GREAT shabu shabu (unfortunately, not in NYC but in LA)... and I'd rate Shabu-Tatsu as better than average.  The sauce is pretty good (I prefer the soy-based one, not the sesame / nutty flavored one); the vegetables (mainly napa cabbage and enoki mushrooms) and the meat are good quality and usually quite lean with a bit of fat; and they provide pretty good udon noodles at the end (a key part to finishing a shabu shabu meal on a proper note).  Oh, don't skip the ice cream at the end... they have excellent green tea and red bean ice cream.Oh, for those of you that love shabu shabu, the Korean version is definitely a must-try (difference being that the soup base is flavored and the best part... they make a rice hash out of the remaining ingredients at the end, with an egg, seaweed flakes, and sesame oil right into the hot pot... SO damn good!).  Let me know if you guys know where I can get the Korean style in NYC... please!
Scott R.}Austin, TX}296}784}12}-1}3}9/23/2007}With apologies to my BYFF, Shabu-Tatsu just didn't do it for me.Why?  Two reasons:1) I just don't like hotpots.  Boiling meat?  Why?  You boil pasta, you boil hypodermic needles, you don't boil meat.  I guess it's fine for vegetables but I'd still grill those too.2) I didn't like the two provided sauces.  I believe they were ponzu (dark brown sauce) and a sesame-based sauce.  Found myself really craving a mustard-based sauce or a spicy Korean sauce.The atmosphere, the experience, and (of course) the company were all nice but, at the end of the day, I'd have preferred to be at a Korean BBQ spot instead...Sorry Shabu-Tatsu.  I just don't appreciate you like the others so I'll be a gentleman and refrain from dipping my meat into your hotpot...
Austin V.}New York, NY}46}376}125}-1}5}9/13/2007}I don't know if they are the best in the city but they are better than the rest i've tried because I find the service good/attentive, clean, good fresh ingredients, they serve huge 20 oz beers for cheap, and they are open late night.  I went on a week day so it wasn't so busy.  So what's with all the different meanings for Shabu? I've always understood it to be "swish-swish" as in the movement of your food in the boiling water...
Grace S.}San Francisco, CA}237}184}9}-1}3}9/7/2007}The Shabu Shabu is above avg, but for all you hardcore, homestyle Korean food lovers out there... their YookGaeJang soup is yummy.
Zoe P.}Medford, MA}163}540}7}-1}4}9/6/2007}So tasty.We actually got the special sukiyaki and the beef was tender and toothsome. The watercress wasn't entirely the freshest and most beautiful when it came to the table, but when it mixed with the noodles and absorbed the cooking sauce and broth, oooooo la la. And there's just something about sweet onions and mushrooms cooked in an iron pan, no matter the cuisine, that I love.But this was my first ever dinner at a shabu-shabu restaurant, so take this review for what it's worth.We also got a duck appetizer (good) and a little slices of beef belly with mustard (even better). Plenty of food for three.
Ro N.}New York, NY}83}2203}88}-1}5}8/28/2007}I went to this place awhile back-so can't remember much of what I had, but I remember it was good and I didn't have a problem with this place besides the person that I went with.  (She kept on dropping and spilling her food on me!)I remember they have different combo deals that comes with ICE CREAM!Which is totally awesome, since who doesn't love ice cream?I haven't gone back in awhile since the weather has been absolutely dreadful here.But once winter rolls around...I am going to holler at this place!
Jetsetgirl B.}San Francisco, CA}1}20}0}-1}4}8/24/2007}The lack of 5 stars comes from the wait. Yelpers love this place as well as the rest of New York. This is a great place to have sukiyaki or shabu shabu( which means dipped twice) in a place that, if you just left japan can almost take you right back. Especially if you get the treat of japanense businessmen late at night drinking tall mugs of beer and the only words floating through the dinning room are japanese. When I got back from Tokyo last year in the dead of winter this is what I got in New York. I was quite pleased.
Niraj S.}Atlanta, GA}3}41}0}-1}3}8/21/2007}I came here to try shabu shabu and I think i just dont like it.  The service was great and the ginger ice cream is awesome but I feel as though the meal itself lacks flavor, the sukiyaki looked good so I may try that next time and edit my review.  Also If you are going here with guys the quantity of food is too small.
Ken C.}New York, NY}49}651}2}-1}3}8/19/2007}Thank you so much. I missed Shabu Shabu since I returned from Japan.  I love eat all you can eat shabu shabu and my buddies love it, too.
Tom L.}NY, NY}40}102}2}-1}5}7/23/2007}Good meat! You get to cook it yourself, which is a little stressful because you have to remember to save it from burning and eat at the same time. But fun, anyway. I took my 13 year old nephew here and he had a good time, though we both got in trouble for playing with our chopsticks (I'm a drummer, give me a break).You can get a bottle of wine for $20, hooray for that!Plan on spending $40 a person with everything included, folks.
Cassandra P.}New York, NY}13}46}0}-1}4}7/12/2007}I just can't hate you, Shabu-Tatsu, even if you weren't that good to me.  I will ignore the dead cockroach on the floor.  I will also ignore the gruff service.  I will even ignore how you crammed  too many of us into a way-too-small table.The shabu was just that good.  The five of us split four orders, and there was still way too much food.  The seafood hot-pot was to die for.  I guess hot-pot is pretty hard to screw up, though.  You can't beat the convenience of the location, unless you make your hot pot at home.  To you, shabu-tatsu, I will return.
Mariposa P.}New York, NY}20}78}88}-1}5}7/5/2007}I just got home from eating that big pile of meat pictured above.  I've been here about 10 times over the years and I always leave satisfied.  I love tiny neighborhood nooks like these that serve amazing food and have great service.
Gianna A.}Boynton Beach, FL}172}359}852}-1}5}6/2/2007}Wonderful restaurant for any occassion.  Small, but traditional Japanese decor makes it feel spacy and uncluttered.  Excellent service and food.  The fact that we were the only non-Asians present says a lot about the quality of the food.
Sonia C.}Seattle, WA}408}864}61}-1}5}3/20/2007}i love shabu because i pretend that it's super healthy even when i'm paying an extra $2 for the premium (aka fattier) beef.  i mean, there's no oil used in the cooking, right?i like swishing & swirling my meat in the water until it's cooked to the perfect degree of "doneness".  i like the vegetables and tofu that make me feel virtuous because i ate them.  i like the strong green tea ice cream too - isn't green tea supposed to be fat-burning?the meat & vegetables come piled high, but don't let the sight of the food intimidate you!  everything cooks down so that you're full at the end of the meal, but not so stuffed that you're going to explode.  actually, if you feel like stuffing yourself, just finish the big bowl of rice and piles of noodles that come with the food.
Amy L.}New York, NY}409}136}15}-1}3}3/19/2007}I'll admit I'm the type of person who likes my food made easy for me -- e.g., meat already off the bone, vegetables pre-cut.  For that reason, hot pot / shabu-shabu (where you cook your items at the table in a pot of boiling water), doesn't get me too excited. That said, Shabu-Tatsu is a clean, cozy place; always busy, items seemingly fresh, service good the few times I've gone.  Plum wine we had with our "special" shabu was cold and comforting in its sweetness. Ice cream was included at the end of the special shabu course; the red bean tasted less of red bean and strangely, more of butter, but the vanilla was icy-creamy, rich in flavor, and hit exactly the right spot.
Phyllis K.}Austin, TX}257}229}4}-1}4}3/8/2007}Although in general I find it pretty difficult to mess up shabu shabu, Shabu Tatsu is the only place I've encountered thus far that leaves me satisfied!  Attentive staff, cozy atmosphere, fresh meat & veggies, and the more delicious smell of all of it cooking, make this place a shabu shabu mainstay. For 20 bucks you can get a set shabu shabu meal complete with app & dessert.  It's the perfect amount of food for the semi-starved appetite, and wont' leave you feeling groggy and overstuffed!Of course, like everyone else says, the soup is the best part!  And even better, they DO NOT use MSG in their soup cups!  It's just salt and pepper!Also I found the pitchers of Sapporo, a first encounter for me, to be absolutely clutch!
Robyn F.}San Francisco, CA}62}454}1}-1}4}3/7/2007}Shabu-Tatsu has always been a favorite of mine, especially during the winter.  The food--What I really love about this place is their Bi Bin Bap!  Personally, I prefer Shabu's Bi Bin Bap over any that I've tried in K-Town.  As for their shabu, their special shabu (beef) is very filling and comes with salad and dessert.  One drawback to their hot pot is that you can't really order a bunch of different meats, as you can at a Chinese hot pot restaurant.  But, beef is always my personal favorite for hot pot, so I'm not complaining.  Atmosphere - The tables are large enough for groups, but the concept of sharing the same pot induces an intimate atmosphere.  Definitely good for going with a group of friends to talk.  My friends and I also refer to this restaurant as the "break-up" restaurant, as we know of at least 2 couples who broke up over the boiling vegetables here.  Since the booths are fairly private, I guess it seems like a private enough place to break up. Service - Usually it's pretty good, but last night we were in a corner of the restaurant and the waiters didn't walk by as much.
Sherilyn T.}Oakland, CA}97}263}96}-1}5}2/1/2007}order the tofu veggie bi bim bop. so freakn good! we also tried the chicken and beef sukiyaki. go for the beef, the chicken was just ok, but the beef was nice and tender. mmmm. and their green tea ice  cream is the authentic green tea kind. now i gotta go back and try the shabu shabu, with a side of tofu veggie bi bim bop, of course.
Julia H.}Menlo Park, CA}73}7}0}-1}5}1/27/2007}When it's cold outside, this is the place to be for some warm shabu shabu or sukiyaki. The steam from the hot pot is also great for that facial you've been wanting to get.
T K.}New York, NY}5}59}0}-1}4}1/22/2007}the moment you step in this restaurant, you could smell a combination of the flavorful aromas seeping from each parties' shabu shabu table...whether it be shabu shabu, sukiyaki or yakiniku. we went saturday night, arguably on a very cold night, so our meal warmed us from the inside out. we both got the shabu shabu dinner A which comes a (large) plate of thinly sliced beef and another large plate of veggies (carrots, leafy greens, clear noodles, mushrooms and tofu). for dipping sauces we were served two types...a mustard color tangy sauce and a soy sauce color tangy sauce you can spice up with scallions and what i believe to be horseradish. the dinner also comes with salad (and possibly soup, i can't remember) and ice cream for dessert.the restaurant is tiny so i recommend getting there early to put your name on the waiting list. i got there at 615p and had to wait about 45 minutes before we were seated. definitely worth the wait though. i would definitely make a return visit, perhaps not on a weekend evening. you come out smelling like the restaurant which when i sniffed my clothes the next morning (i don't usually get into a habit of sniffing my clothes but i was deciding if they were wearable again) it made me want to go back that very night! bonus points for leaving a last impression. just minus one star for or half a star really for the possible long wait.
Jen D.}Berlin, Germany}268}1481}274}-1}5}11/18/2006}Best shabu shabu in the city. The beef is fantastic and the assortment of veggies is superb. The broth is a little bland but it's a great way to top off the meal. And at the end, you get ice cream! Who doesn't like ice cream!!Most forget about the other stuff when eating shabu shabu but the appetizers are also deeeelicous! My favorite is the teriyaki tofu app. So great!
Amy Y.}New York, NY}150}121}0}-1}5}9/26/2006}I was pretty excited when I heard the hype about this place.  This place offers hot-pot in its original form: a big pot for all to share, family-style.The shabu-shabu here must be ordered at a minimum of 2 orders (aka, for 2), so if you're a singleton, shabu is out of the picture.. well, I guess unless you eat for two.   It's around $20/person and you get pre-made Japanese sauces (sesame and lemon-soy sauce), veggies, meat and noodles.  The meat (I'm talking about beef) here is TOP-NOTCH.  It is superb and easily the best in shabu-shabu.  The standard "veggies" come with neatly sliced and generously portioned lettuce, arugula, tofu, shiitaki and enoki mushrooms, scallions, udon and thick clear noodles.  Afterwards, you have your choice of vanilla, strawberry, red bean and green team for dessert.  However, since I love topping off a good shabu with a bowl of noodles and endless sipping of its rich broth, my only complaint is the "broth" here starts off as just plain 'ol H2O, no salt, no nuthin.   But that's ok, because soup bowls are delivered to your table with a little bit of salt and pepper.  I love topping my shabu experience off with a little bowl of noodles and soup, especially in the winter time.  They also offer options outside of shabu.  You can try their BBQ or select from a long list of entrees like the Japanese-styled bibimbop, curried rice, gyoza, etc. The service here is very attentive.  But, the wait can get pretty long on prime nights and weekends and they only take reservation if you have a party of 6 or above. Doh!
Mike C.}New York, NY}211}25}1}-1}5}1/26/2006}Best Shabu in NYC I love this joint best on cold winter nights to help warm up your bones. good portions on the meats and friendly staff.I came here last night and Damn how i missed shabu shabu. My Friend and I both decided that if we were ever on Death row our last meal would be shabu shabu from here.
Vicky L.}Jersey City, NJ}783}903}409}18}5}1/13/2006}went there for the first time last week.  usually i never make it in the door cuz the line is always out the door and i'm too hungry to wait.  but if you go @ around 6:30 - 7pm, you should have no trouble getting a table.  It's worth it, trust me.  My friend and I got the Shabu-Shabu for two, which comes with raw sliced beef, tofu, veggies, noodles, rice, and various dipping sauces.  Shabu-Shabu is where they give you a large pot of boiling water and you cook the food yourself.  It's really fun and especially cute if you are on a date!  They also serve sukiyaki, and yakiniku.

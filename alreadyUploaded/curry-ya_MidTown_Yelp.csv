P C.}New York, NY}2}83}35}-1}5}4/21/2018}Wonderful curry. I had the chicken katsu curry and the chicken was perfectly juicy and moist inside while remaining crispy on the outside. Love the pickles and fried onion topping. Finally, the service was super attentive and always kept my green tea topped up. Nice place for a quick sit down lunch or takeout.

Annie N.}Brooklyn, NY}160}274}715}18}4}2/28/2018}This is my second time ordering here for mealpal and  i am definitely a fan! The flavors are always just right and I can see myself coming back here time and and time again for mealpal, however I took off one star because the portions are sooo small, im not sure if its because it was takeout or because it was mealpal? I can't see myself paying $14.5 for a curry if the portions are so tiny. I wonder if they do business accounts or purchase orders because it would make a great option for company lunches at my office. Please open up a location on the upper east side so i dont have to travel so far to pick up my lunch!
Wai S.}Manhattan, NY}0}23}0}-1}2}1/26/2018}Portions are super small for the price range. This is a review for the Lunch Specials, so maybe that's the reason why.  Seafood curry contained 1.5 small shrimp, basically two tiny shrimps cut even tinier into half and I was given 3 halves, lol. There was no squid but four tiny cubes of scallop. Seriously, it's super small. I didn't count how many slices for the Chicken Katsu I had last week, but I felt the same way about small portions.   Taste-wise, it's average at best. Just curry goop which is giving it taste.  I gave it ago again today cause I am eating out tonight in a grand big feast and need an empty stomach.
Doris H.}Nice, France}195}16}35}-1}5}12/27/2017}So glad they open up a new location in midtown so I don't have to go all the way down. Always my favorite since I came to NYC five years ago! I love love love the classic curry, it's just done so right, so nicely if you want curry very much but want something that's not too heavy. The beef stewed in classic curry could melt in your mouth! Love it!!!
Sherry Z.}Manhattan, NY}247}77}73}18}3}11/30/2017}I was so excited to see Curry-Ya open a location here, because when I went to the East Village location too frequently when I lived in the area. Unfortunately, I think this place is still trying to find its footing. First of all, was the baked curry always this expensive?! I don't think I would have paid an additional $5.50 to my meal back in college considering how I hesitate to order it even now. For lunch you get a free salad with your meal, which was fresh but the vinaigrette was overly acidic, borderline astringent. The dry curry was okay, much sweeter than I remember it to be, but the portion is huge and I like to sprinkle the dried garlic very generously over everything for the texture. My friend got the chicken curry and had no complaints. I found the staff to be a little off-putting, as they clustered around the entrance / register area and chatted, and it took us several tries to get their attention for our check. Considering how small the space is, clustering at the entrance at lunch time doesn't seem like the best idea.
Diyang Y.}New York, NY}207}80}95}18}3}11/29/2017}I got the pork katsu curry for lunch from Meal Pal. Overall, I would say the meal was pretty average. This is in no way a bad thing. It's just that there's nothing special about this Japanese curry. Good thing for Curry-Ya, I love Japanese curry. If you're in the area, you can't do wrong going here.One thing to note is that the portions seem pretty small. I'm not sure if it's because of Meal Pal, or because it was takeout, but the portions are smaller than the other restaurants in the area.
Hugh M.}Montclair, NJ}0}111}0}-1}4}11/18/2017}good curry for a pretty cheap price. only bad thing is the price of the toppings. get just the curry
Andrew R.}Manhattan, NY}2}42}0}-1}4}11/17/2017}Yum. Super satisfying on a cold day. Tiny but efficient space and some interesting twists on basic Japanese curry. Great addition to the other Japanese restaurants in East Midtown.
Antonio O.}Manhattan, NY}9}6}0}-1}1}11/16/2017}Very poor service.  I ordered a Japanese classic meal yesterday 15 November 2017. I got the bag with the meal to take away and then when I opened the bag I found that the soup was not included as described in the menu. Today I went to the restaurant to the same person who gave me the bag with the meal yesterday and she told me to report to mealpal directly as I got the meal through mealpal. I found this as a very poor customer service: not only they did not give me the meal I paid for but also they did not apology and they washed their hands saying to me to ask someone else outside their restaurant.The food itself tastes quite OK but very expensive for what you pay for and portions are too small. My ordered was supposed to include beef and it just got two very small chunks of beef.
Eugenia Y.}Fremont, CA}431}97}150}18}4}11/8/2017}I've been meaning to try this place since I walk past it a lot to get to work. I finally went in earlier today for lunch. It's this cute little place that's small and cosy! Honestly, the food was tasty and I found nothing wrong with it. I had the Japanese classic and chose "hot" for spice option. However, I am giving it 4 stars because I personally don't think it's anything special, and the price is a little high for what you get.
Scott S.}Short Hills, NJ}4308}695}1286}18}4}11/8/2017}I've been coming here on MealPal regularly and I have to say that this place is great.  I have only taken out and haven't dined in do I can't opine on what it's like to eat there.  What I can tell you is this is the uninstructed comfort food.  The curry is thick, almost gravy like, well seasoned and so good I try to suck every last drop out of the container. The chicken and beef that I have had were tender and damn delicious.  The veggies have crunch and the rice perfectly absorbs the curry sauce.  There is much on the menu that sounds fantastic and I look forward to trying them all.
Sam L.}New York, NY}35}6}1}-1}1}10/26/2017}Horrible! They claimed that they threw away my Mealpal take out order when I went to pick it up (pickup was 1:45pm and I arrived at 3pm). Instead of trying to accommodate the customer, they simply said tough luck. It was a $6 lunch order and their unwillingness to work with me let's me know that they don't care about their customers. All they care about is making a buck.  So disappointing.  They have lost a customer and I will never patronize them again.
格格}New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}10/25/2017}The worst curry I have ever had!!!I have been using yelp for many yrs and never complain about any restaurants before. But today I have to say it is the worst curry place I have ever had.It costs me $15 for the classic curry, $12 for the dry curry. They only give me four little pieces of beef for the classic curry. The food is too little. Me and my colleague both feel hungry after having this curry, though we both had breakfast before. It is really not worth of this price. We will never go there again.
Laura L.}Manhattan, NY}3}12}59}-1}4}10/25/2017}Small, clean and modern place to sit and eat/order out, doesn't look like there's a restroom. Good food, good prices for NYC and nice staff. I ordered lunch for pick up and once I arrived, asked to sit and eat. They obliged and gave me a table and my choice, immediately served me an ice water and small fresh salad. The room was empty of customers. There was some pop music playing. Tuesday special was veggie curry. Mine came with a hair / long fiber. I pulled it out. I was on a call too and didn't bother telling them. Minus one star (I'd only do half, but that doesn't exist here) for the hair/fiber and small dining room. Nice staff. They offered me a punch card.
Irene C.}Fort Lee, NJ}219}241}763}18}4}10/23/2017}Desperate to find a lunch spot to cure my Monday blue, I found this cute little Japanese curry place just couple blocks from my office. I must give 5 stars for the Japanese classic curry ($14.5), i cooked curry a lot for dinner, but I still struggle on how to keep the flavor of the veggies, meats but not letting the curry overpowering. I think Curry-ya did a wonderful job on it ,it's a perfect balance of keeping the sweetness of veggies, flavor of the meats and the spicy of the curry altogether and it reached a great harmony. I really can't express how happy I was. Love the waitress, she is really cute and very polite!  Why 4 Stars? - I took 1 star off because of the price is high, I paid $23 for my lunch ( a curry rice & a coffee plus tips and tax), I don't think I will come back to this place too often just because the price is not very friendly. The rice was also under cooked (Such a bummer!!) !! It tasted nothing like Japanese rice ( the Japanese rice is supposed to be chewy and fluffy ) and I felt I was biting the rocks. Curry and rice need to be the perfect match but sadly the rice was such a let down.  (Sad face ).
Ryan L.}Chapel Hill, NC}0}5}0}-1}2}10/15/2017}Pretty plain curry at ridiculous prices. Customer service is one of the worst i've seen in nyc
Richard K.}Brooklyn, NY}0}138}0}-1}4}10/12/2017}Good lunch addition to the neighborhood. I've only tried the chicken katsu curry, but it was quick and tasty - comforting without being overly greasy. There's a reasonably nice - if very small - interior for eating in.
Liyu C.}New York, NY}40}3}6}-1}5}9/25/2017}This place is super nice and quiet. Not so many people during lunch time. Ordered chicken katsu Curry and pork katsu curry. KatSu is crispy. For lunch special, salad is served along with curry order. Deserve a try.
Vanessa L.}Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY}3}2}0}-1}5}9/19/2017}when i came into the restaurant, there was very good vibes. i got served by this really nice girl called ling. she was very helpful with all the questions that i had. she made my time eating very enjoyable. 10/10 service! and the food was delicious as well! I got the pork katsu with mixed veggies curry and it was very flavorful and the katsu was fried to perfection!
Carol B.}Manhattan, NY}18}91}44}-1}5}9/14/2017}It's so great to see them open a branch in my boy toy's neighborhood! We no longer have to take Uber SUV down to east village to get this savory food any more. I picked up some to go's on my way over to Jose's house and it was delightful. I got the chicken katsu curry and made Jose get the beef curry cuz he's gotta be "beefy" and stay "up" all night if u know what i mean ;) Anyway, it was great, just as expected. YAY for curry-ya branches! Love you guys!!!

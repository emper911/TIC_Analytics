Zoey F.}Brooklyn, New York, NY}1}1}0}-1}5}5/8/2018}Great! Food was amazing, really anything you order is packed with taste, freshness and just awesome flavor. Good variety and the tapas menu makes it easy to try different things.
Carla A.}Brooklyn, NY}2}6}0}-1}5}4/30/2018}I had a great lunch here with my office mates. We work in Manhattan and usually pass on this place when we go home so a couple of weeks ago we went in. I tried their sashimi and tempura it was an instant hit. Their noodles are also good, its soft and the soup is very tasty. I highly recommend them!
Leo S.}Vancouver, Canada}1}4}0}-1}5}4/29/2018}Great place for izakaya. Came in here on a weeknight and had a wonderful experience. The service was attentive and efficient. The ambiance is also nice and relaxing. The food was also very good.
Tanya P.}Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY}48}12}35}-1}5}4/23/2018}What a pleasant surprise ! First time here and can't wait to go back. Great sushi ,and everything around. Service is excellent ! Big variety of Sake  Seal the deal for the perfect Japanese restaurant. My new favorite place.
Arya O.}Manhattan, New York, NY}1}4}0}-1}4}4/23/2018}Great authentic Japanese food. The food was very tasty. Service was great. Good variety and the tapas menu. Their selection of sake is vast.
Luca L.}Narragansett, RI}22}157}3}-1}3}4/21/2018}I had the lunch special and a coffee. It was okay. Something I could find at a bodega not specializing in Japanese food.They have a daily lunch special which changes depending on the day. I am not sure if they have vegan options - but they do have a fish and egg one.
Josephine L.}New Brunswick, NJ}59}4}10}-1}5}4/17/2018}Probably my favorite sushi restaurant in the city. The sashimi tastes fresh. Quite decorative dishes but not excessively overpriced. The tasting menu definitely worth the money. Nice ambiance too. An ideal place for dating or hanging out with friends. But I will consider bring my own drink. The sake and fruit wine are way too expensive given the tiny amount of servings.
Fifi S.}Rochester, NY}76}26}1}-1}5}4/14/2018}A underground gem with lots of delicious appetizers and sake/wine. The seaweed is a must try, not like the common green color seaweed. Here is a mixture of four different types of fresh seaweed with sesame dressing -tastes really unique and awesome. Second must try is the handmade soba.
Edster W.}Weymouth, MA}2}197}93}-1}3}4/13/2018}On Labor Day weekend, my friend and I went here for dinner. It is not easy to find and is located in the basement level of an office building. We ordered a few dishes to share:* Gomoku Kinpira - lotus, carrots, hijiki seaweed, burdock root, and beef in sesame oil* Uzaku - eel w/cucumber slices and wakame seaweed* Gindara Yuan Yaki - grilled black cod in sweet soy sauce* Tori Karaage - fried chicken thigh marinated in sake and soy sauce* Buta Kakuni - braised pork belly* Nihachi soba - cold buckwheat noodles w/soy dipping sauceWe also ordered some desserts to share. The food was good but nothing really stood out.
Nathaniel C.}Thousand Island Park, NY}3}19}20}-1}5}4/10/2018}This is a really cool spot in the midtown east area, perfect for a date/small group - you have to navigate through the lobby of an office building to some stairs down to the basement, but once you do you feel like you're transported into a completely different place.  Filled with Sake barrels, some small trees, nice art.. the decor and look feels very authentic and has a great overall vibe!  They've got a good sake selection - our server was able to give us some great recommendations for some dry but still smooth sake (which we'd 100% recommend).  We sat at the bar, which I'd actually prefer cause you get a nice view of the room and still have plenty of space.  The food is basically tapas style, so we got around 5 options (2 of us).  Some things that really stuck out to us were the Uzaku (Eel with cucumber) - something I would never have ordered on my own and came highly recommended by our server!! You have to try it!  I would also highly recommend the Pork Belly and the Black Cod - both were really good!!
Aaron S.}New York, NY}226}146}830}18}4}4/8/2018}This place is somewhat hidden. It is located at the basement level of an office building. There are directions, so you won't get lost. Once you get to the basement, it's like you're transported to a small Japanese shop. We came here for their lunch special. They have different soba sets for $12.50 (previously $12) from Monday to Friday. There's only 30 servings of these sets, so come early! We went there on a Thursday and ordered the Barachirashi Don.Barachirashi Don w/ Cold Soba: assortment of diced raw fish on top of rice. There wasn't that much fish on top, but it was enough to be satisfied. The rice was soft and slightly sticky. The cold soba came with a dipping sauce. Mix the wasabi and scallions in the dipping sauce to give it more flavor. The soba has a slightly chewy and firm texture similar to al dente pasta. Overall, this is a great place for lunch! It's difficult to beat a lunch set for $12 (now $12.50). This place gets really busy, so come early or try to make a reservation. I'll be back again when I'm in the area.
Louie D.}Los Angeles, CA}1}3}0}-1}4}4/4/2018}The variety of dishes on the menu combined with precise performance and presentation puts even some of the more highly professional restaurants in shame. In short, great food, great drinks.
Justin F.}Henderson, NV}1}3}6}-1}4}4/2/2018}Right as I walked in, I felt a vibe of Japanese culture. They had great decorations throughout the establishment, and I got to have a taste of a real Japanese restaurant. The food was very flavorful, and tasted very fresh. That was probably the best part of this restaurant. The price was comparable to a fancy steakhouse, paying $90 per person. Service wasn't anything memorable.We asked for a to-go item at the beginning of our dinner and they approved. However once we finished our meal, they said we couldn't pack it, and we had an extra bowl of the Salmon Chirashi. I would recommend this place to any first comers, but I will probably not be back anytime soon.
Ann Y.}Bellevue, WA}1}4}4}-1}4}4/1/2018}Chill place to try some sake. They have the biggest sake menu I've ever seen including descriptions of what makes each style different. The bartender was very knowledgeable and gave me helpful recommendations based on my preference. Highly recommend if you're into sake!Food was beautifully prepared but taste was just okay. Attentive service!
Racer C.}Washington, DC}59}46}25}-1}3}3/31/2018}Stopped by for happy hour last night.  Place is small but cozy.  Ordered sake, Japanese beer and sushi.  Met a couple of new faces.  I will be back.
Chi H.}North Potomac, MD}38}48}68}-1}4}3/31/2018}Amazing selection of sake and the waitress was knowledgeable with it as well.  The food was amazing.  Tried the duck, peppers, tamago, beef tataki, sashimi, agedashi tofu, eel salad, and pork shoulder.  Favorite was the beef tataki and peppers
Samantha R.}Los Angeles, CA}6}3}0}-1}5}3/26/2018}amazing food.  great staff. very friendly waiter.  Extremely authentic.
Ali S.}Flagstaff, AZ}0}2}2}-1}5}3/24/2018}Salmon sashimi was very fresh and the sake was amazing! We went on a night where the sake was straight outta Japan and the brewer was there. Not usually available in the states. I loved the fried pork and the cold udon was AMAZING. Going again in April.
Tulsi M.}New York, NY}161}23}9}-1}3}3/20/2018}What a let down! Not great for vegetarians. They have a vegetarian menu but it's not great, no real hot dishes on it either.Shishito peppers- they were just steamed! No flavoring at all. For the first time in a while I had to ask the waiter to bring salt. Eggplant: good but the flavoring was bitter. I also asked the waiter for hot water with lemon and it took him about 10-15 minutes to bring it. The ambiance is nice. Location is great. I don't think it's an off night though. The waiter didn't seemed phased when I mentioned the flavor was lacking.
Maggie L.}New York, NY}280}72}153}-1}5}3/16/2018}Came here for lunch and uh $12.50 for a lunch set wuuuut sign me up fam. Supposedly they only serve 30 sets a day so I'd consider myself lucky (or just early but hey). The Friday special consisted with choice of hot or cold soba and hayashi rice. Was expecting small portions because that's usually what happens with lunch specials but boy I was wrong. I didn't even finish my food because I was super full. Aside from the lunch special, tempura assortment (mixed) were rightfully crispy outside and tender inside. Tofu salad was healthy and refreshing, great start to the meal. It can be easy to miss this lowkey secretive spot, so pay attention to the signs. Everything was priced fairly and I think I'd like to be back for dinner.
Kerry I.}Chinatown, Manhattan, NY}1}10}4}-1}2}3/9/2018}Being from japan I have to say I am disappointed by the lack of hospitality when you first enter this place. The restaurant is already hard enough to find, and we got no greeting or instructions when you get there. It's like you were invisible to the hostesses( even tho there were 2 of them). We didn't have a reservation so we decided to try our luck and was told a 15 mins wait. So after 45 mins of waiting we were getting very hungry and impatient. And when we went to confirm with the hostess, not only did she gave us an attitude she kept trying to shut us off by saying it's cause we didn't have reservation. You would never have this kind of experience in japan. She did not understand the issue here was that if she did her job correctly and  gave us a more accurate wait time from the beginning, we would've made a more suitable decision by going somewhere else for dinner. But no, instead we waited for almost an hour only to be treated rudely by her rudeness,  not even offering to hang our coats like she did with other guests. Having been to a lot of excellent Japanese restaurants in the city this is by far the worst experience we had with Japanese hostesses.
John S.}Ossining, NY}8}96}0}-1}3}3/7/2018}For an absolutely authentic Japanese experience in Manhattan, Sakagura is a must. For me though the food itself was just average really. Nothing that blew my mind. And for some transplanted Japanese natives this may be a good thing. The yakaturi was the highlight. We ordered a bunch. Top tip: go for the funkier cuts of meet on the yakaturi, like gizzards, liver, and hearts. The chicken thigh yakaturi was just so-so. I do a much better job at home. I had the plain hot soba bowl with a poached egg. The egg was poached to perfection, however the Soba broth was light in flavor and the noodles were okay. So the bottom line, worth a try for the experience, but certainly better choices out there for some noodles in broth.
Y S.}Manhattan, NY}3}39}3}-1}3}3/7/2018}Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I was not particularily impressed by the food. But otherwise, I had a great time and would recommend checking out the place at least once. Okay: Buta Kakuni (steamed), Unisoba (noodle), Hirame Ponzu (sashimi), Shishito Age (fried), Amaebi Shutouae (shukou), Gomoku Kinpira (shukou)Disappointed/Disliked: Ika Shiokara (shukou), Tori Karaage (fried), Dashimaki Tagmago (grilled)
Matteo B.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}3/4/2018}If you want to splurge in sushi this is the place. Everything always fresh and nice environment. Highly recommend trying the tuna tartar.
Stacy Y.}New York, NY}2}33}11}-1}4}3/2/2018}This place is delicious. My favorite was the pork belly. It melts in your mouth with all the flavor packed in. The uni soba was not terrible - it was alright. Highly recommend the black sesame crepe brûlée. It was a perfect balance of sesame. This place is in the basement so pretty hidden and hard to find.
Atticus H.}Brooklyn, NY}1}48}1}-1}5}3/1/2018}Tucked away, serving delicious authentic Japanese food.
Kimmy U.}New York, NY}213}328}1022}18}4}2/25/2018}3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the ambiance!We really lucked out on a Saturday night for the 2 of us around 7:00 pm with only a 5-10 minute wait. Other reviews definitely recommend a reservation.Sakagura is located downstairs in a business building. Once you walk in, you are transported to a Japanese garden/tea house with beautiful decorations! I was so impressed with their set up. It looks like the thing to get here is their lunch special, but we came for DINNER, so here goes --This is a small plates style restaurant. We ordered 6 for the two of us since the waiter said 2 of our dishes were meant for 'one' person. There were some very HIGH's and very low's..Favorites:- uni, ikura, poached egg in a cold dashi broth (Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago): beautifully presented and delicious. my fave of the night- pork belly (buta kakuni): one of their more popular dishes. A square of slow cooked pork belly that was melt in your mouth! I would've liked this more if I weren't so full from the rest of our meal. This dish came out last- grilled pike mackerel onigiri (Yaki Sanma onigiri): Our waiter warned us this is "fishy," but it isn't any fishier than regular grilled mackerel! So good!! I highly recommend this onigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect- black sesame creme brulee: PERFECT end to our meal. It's served with a scoop of black sesame ice cream as well. I thought $14 was a bit much for a dessert, but once we (more like I) devoured it, I felt it was justified.PASS:- ebi sticks: no thanks. shrimp wrapped in nori wrapped in eggroll wrapper and fried. Nothing special- grilled black cod (Gindara Yuan Yaki): wayyy too salty. Some parts of the fish were also overcooked- chopped raw octopus: did not like this at allThey have an extensive menu, so it's hard to pick and choose during your first visit. But I would definitely order the 4 dishes listed above again if I come back!P.S. they have the best matches!!! Don't forget one on your way out
Ed M.}Ahnatal, Germany}3}153}164}-1}3}2/18/2018}We were looking for a light tempura meal near the hotel and this restaurant got good reviews. Nice website.  The lined up sake jugs looked real inviting.   It  was a disappointment.  Our small table was wobbly, so the waitress tries stuffing cardboard there.  It came loose again when she served the food.  So we ate on this wobbly table.    Both the tempura batter and the udon soup did not taste Japanese.   And the tempura came half submerged in the soup.  While it is not bad food, it is definitely not 4 star Japanese food.  There were many Japanese places in the area years ago.  The staff here seem to speak Chinese.  Probably the original owner sold out a while ago.  After a good look, the physical appearance, the maintenance and visible cleanliness, the greeting and food style all point the same way.  We decided to limit our exposure without a fuss and just ate the 2 udons and a mediocre tofu dish and go.  I would not call this a Japanese restaurant strictly speaking.  Perhaps the sakes are good, we were tempted but the food and the table just did not becken.
Cindy U.}New York, NY}201}336}511}-1}3}2/17/2018}Restaurant is tucked away, lower level of what looks to be a commercial building. Super hidden spot, loved that concept.Food: There are certain dishes are are super yum, but others that just aren't worth it. Portions are fairly small and some vegetable dishes that are cooked up are fairly bland. Nothing that really stuck out to me other than the pork belly, super tender and filled with juices.Drinks: There is such a wide selection of sake and plum wines which makes this a redeeming factor for the restaurant. You can easily run up your bill by trying out the different drinks they have to offer. Ambiance: Love the fact that it is quiet, so it is great for conversation. Restaurant service is amazing, I definitely applaud the staff. Price: A little over priced in my opinion for the foods that you get, you can easily spend $100 per person. Not my favorite Japanese place
Masa I.}Queens, Queens, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}2/16/2018}My favorite Japanese restaurant. Sake selection is great. All fishes are flesh!
Pamela M.}Manhattan, NY}93}150}98}-1}5}2/13/2018}Great authentic Japanese food that is cuisine more than just rolls! Loved the ambience and the way sake is served on ice with beautiful flower presentation. The tofu salad, sashimi & chicken meatballs were all delicious!
Aoshi L.}Jersey City, NJ}4}126}0}-1}5}2/10/2018Updatedreview}Tried the lunch tasting menu. $ 36 for sashimi, noodles, steak, slowly cooked fish and tempura!What can you possibly expect more...But bear in mind that the lunch tasting menu is for weekday lunch times only.Also, the lunch strengthened my mind that I just can't distinguish high-quality sashimi with, say, supermarket ones. There is a slight difference in the freshness, but not large enough for the extra money. : (The noodle, as I said before, is the BEST noodle in the whole NY area.Steak is OK, pretty tender and juicy. I ordered medium rare, just good enough for me. : )The slowly cooked fish is a bit too salty, but it melts within your mouth with a bare touch of your tongue.Highly recommend the tempura!! Unlike the ones I tried in other places, the fried food here is relatively more greasy. But! It totally worth it because it's VERY satisfying to have it. Oh man. It fulfills all the wildest and greedy dream you have about fried food.
Catherine N.}Oakland, CA}15}107}204}18}5}2/6/2018}This has to be one of my favorite restaurants based on the simplicity of the menu yet possessing a powerful and memorable distinct taste to each of its item on the menu. What I mean by this is that unlike other restaurants, the food here is not salty. Rather each one is filled with flavors carefully crafted utilizing a blend of spices and natural flavors to make the dish taste good to the customer. I think it's an extremely skillful art to make food taste good without a large addition of salt.Tips:1. Reservation here is highly recommended by a week in advance. 2. Also, this place is very well hidden as there are no signage. I highly recommend that when you go here to eat, do that, just eat. Forget your phone, because it won't work since the restaurant is located in the basement of a business building accessible through the fire exit stairwell.3. All food items are small dishes This is what my friend and I ordered and my thoughts regarding the following dishes:- Gindara Yuan Yaki ($22) - grilled black cod fish- Special sliced squid sashimi ($12?) - came with minced ginger and soy sauce on the side-  Nasu Dengaku ($8.5) grilled eggplants with 3 types of miso. Each one had a distinct yet very subtle taste.- Chanwanmushi ($9) steamed egg custard. This dish was very soft, subtle, home-like taste. When you eat it, it makes you feel nostalgic of being home and warm in bed... hahaha, at least that's how it made me feel!!- Buta Kakuni ($7) just a piece of pork belly in its own broth. So simple yet so tasty and what a clean taste. Fat has been removed from the broth leaving you to truly taste the broth for what it truly is. I double dipped the meat in the broth and wow was that a great idea!! More flavor!! - Tori Tsukune ($10) chicken meat balls with teriyaki sauce. The chicken meat tasted and appeared very lean. It's amazing how well it tasted and how moist the meat was despite being lean. - Yaki Santa Onigiri ($14) rice balls mixed with mackerel, its supposed to be the most fishiest tasting dish and I heard many people do not like this dish but I thought it was very well curated!! A bit fishy the good kind not the bad - oh it's gone bad type of fishy!!- Hot Inaniwa Udon ($13.5) another simple yet satisfying dish with udon and hot soup. Again, the soup is made with an exciting combination of flavor that I can't identify but it goes so well together. I'm fine if this dish was just soup alone!!- hot sake, I forget which one we ordered since I'm not much of an alcohol drinker I couldn't figure how to judge this drink. Although, I heard that people come here to drink the sake on its ownMy favorite dishes was the Sliced squid sashimi, Gindara Yuan Yaki (black cod), Chanwanmushi (steamed egg) and the Buta Kakuni (pork belly). Between my friend and I, we should have stopped ordering at dish number 5, because after the pork belly we were so full. But we somehow managed to eat up the rest of our satisfying order. The bill came out to be $130 without tip.My experience here was truly wonderful and I can't wait to bring another friend to try out this place with me again!
J C.}Manhattan, NY}3}37}27}-1}1}1/30/2018}We had no reservations and when we were seated, were explained that we had a two hour limit to eat.  That's understandable. Two hour seems like more than enough time. But our waiter made us extremely uncomfortable and tried to rush us out as quickly as possible. He was constantly checking his watch whenever he was around us. He was checking his watch when he handed us the menus, when he was taking our orders, each time our food came out, everytime he came to "check on us", and every single time he passed by our table. He kept emphasizing that we have a limited time to eat here. By the time we ate everything we had ordered (which wasn't a lot because we didn't realize how small the orders were until they came out and everyone was still hungry) we had about an hour left. But because of how uncomfortable the waiter made us, we decided to just go get a second dinner somewhere else instead of ordering more food.
M K.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}1}-1}3}1/28/2018}Pros:- Nice, calm atmosphere appropriate for all ages; great for a quiet date or even to take your mother out for dinner.- To my knowledge, Sakagura has the largest sake selection.- Fresh, well cooked food.- Polite and efficient staff.Cons (And why I give Sakagura only 3 stars)- Greeted at the door at opening, only to be told that my boyfriend and I had until 8 to eat due to reservations. Cool, no problem.- Class of standard sake such as Ootokoyama (which is about $10-15 a glass at other restaurants) cost a whopping 41 bucks. A GLASS, people. Great, huge sake selection but so obnoxiously overpriced. HUGE rip off, sake lovers. Don't be fooled by the 150% mark up.- Ordered a number of dishes to try, and after a couple of bites, server comes over to tell us it's the "last call for kitchen" letting us know it's our last chance to order anything. Umm, okay, I guess we'll order one more dish just in case.- Once we'd finish a dish, someone would rush by to clear the plate away and normally, I'd appreciate a clean table, but I could tell Sakagura does it to rush tables out. Starting to get annoyed at this point, especially because we've only been here an hour.- Food is fresh and lovely, but they're food you can really get at any fresh, authentic Japanese restaurant. (Psst, sesame creme brulee is way better at Hakata Ton Ton.)Would've been fine overall, but the fact that we couldn't thoroughly enjoy our dinner without being rushed left a really bad taste in our mouths. I simply didn't feel the $200 bill and spending my birthday here was worth it.
Howard M.}New York, NY}1}24}5}-1}4}1/26/2018}i came here on MLK day, a public holiday and they still offered their daily lunch special along with their lunch sets.  kudos for that, many businesses revert to their full a la carte menu's on public holidays so i appreciate they didn't do that.  the food is well prepared and you can tell that the detail is there...soba is really fresh here and the soba dipping (cold soba) isn't overly salty.  i also had the menchi katsu (minced meat katsu)..my only gripe is that the katsu was prepared earlier in the day given that its the lunch special and the two pieces i got were cold (but still delicious).  i'll come back again for lunch!
Pauline L.}WHITESTONE, NY}3}18}44}-1}4}1/24/2018}So I finally got a chance to come here. I've been begging my co-workers and I finally found someone who would come with me, I hate dining alone. If I could get over this pet peeve.. I would come here myself!I think the food was really good and decently priced. My "Jewel" Box was very filling , but did not feel like I needed to be rolled out. It was the perfect way to do a tasting menu of their sushi - offering. My friend had the beef hash lunch special and she seemed to enjoy it. Our waitress Marcia, was just so sweet and so informative. She was very attentative and it made our experience that much more greater. She did not rush us at all.If you don't have room for dessert, make room because the chocolate souffle should not be missed !
Jessica L.}Flushing, NY}318}104}164}18}4}1/22/2018}Came here for New Years soba because Soba Totto totto was packed. The atmosphere at Sakagura is so calming to me and just overall enjoyable. The flowers and plants are all real and beautifully arranged. Though a bit pricy, it is a good once in a while go to restaurant. No need to worry about oil/grease/ fattening foods. Their tea that they provide is pleasant to drink. They have a lunch special everyday for only $12. Plain hot soba is $10. Their udon is also not the usual thick udon but thin (pretty much the same as soba in my opinion). I tried their tempura soba ($17) and it's a hefty bowl of noodles. You'll definitely be full from that. Their desserts all ranged around $10-$14. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try them out but they sounded delicious to try and not too sweet (black sesame creme brûlée, yuzu mousse, etc.) They can only split the bill between 4 credit cards.
Peter M.}Brooklyn, NY}88}3}1}-1}5}1/19/2018}Got there just in time on a Thursday for the daily lunch special - absolutely worth it.  Yes, there's a bit more rice than one would hope (compared to the amount of sashimi), but that's alright - it was really good rice!  The tempura appetizer (mixed assortment of fish, veggies, shrimp, and lotus root) was delicious.  It was so light and crispy, no hint of it being too oily or greasy.  Additionally, the hot soba (also offer cold) was pretty tasty.  Really helps top an amazing lunch for under 15$.Great stuff!  Will come back often.
Mike B.}New York, NY}15}400}17}-1}4}1/16/2018}A very cool place tucked into the basement of an office building: you have to go into the building to find the restaurant.Tasty food, excellent soba and not unreasonably priced (except for desert, which is wildly overpriced). Great lunch specials but limited quantity (basically, you have to get there before noon).The only downside is they are very strict and have many rules, to the extent that it may detract from your dining enjoyment. As well as the fact that they work really hard to turn over the tables, and are sometimes quite aggressive about it
Tania S.}Manhattan, NY}5}170}254}-1}5}1/11/2018}I love the food here. I've been a few times and each time, the food has been fresh and quick, perfect for a midtown lunch hour. But be aware that cell signal is terrible since it's in an office building basement. The decor is adorable as well. You may need to go early to avoid the rush though. The thurs chirashi don special is gorgeous and the chicken meatballs and chicken donburi is delicious as well.
Gary L.}Rowland Heights, CA}22}7}14}-1}4}1/4/2018}I give 4 points to it just because of its beef tongue and Miyazaki beef. These two items are really delicious and I recommend! I go there twice in 3 days,but the sea urchins are not fresh all the time. So I don't recommend uni soba there. Over all  this is a good jp restaurant where you could enjoy the good food and service.
Dan C.}Manhattan, NY}12}72}16}18}4}1/2/2018}The food is good, but it's expensive. You may want to come here after having a light snack or something so you can leave fully satisfied without breaking your wallet, but all in all one of my favorite places in the city.I love their sake glasses HAHA I swear it makes their sake taste that much better.
Susan X.}Claremont, CA}5}367}152}-1}5}12/29/2017}Vegetable soba-delicious. Clear and savory veggie soup. Plenty of vegetables. Good quality of handmade soba noodles. Delicious pickles. Not too salty. A little sweet. Salmon roe onigiri-excellent. Warm rice. Fresh salmon roes. Good with seaweed. Excellent presentation.
Yinglu W.}New York, NY}1}91}108}-1}5}12/26/2017}A hidden Japanese spot, tbe cuisine was decent and worth trying. Ordered sashimi and two other appetizers as usual. Healthy and delicious.
Kevin H.}San Francisco, CA}0}1}0}-1}2}12/23/2017}I came here for my birthday with a party of 16 for my birthday and was expected to be seated with all my friends, but instead, we were separated into two parties with our backs against each other. The food was alright from the prix fixe menu, it was either a hit or miss. But yeah, if you want to be separated from your friends like fucking Dragon Balls, this is your place. Stupid fuck manager should tell people next time if they're not gonna be seated together.
Ellie L.}Manhattan, NY}148}220}4}-1}4}12/22/2017}The four stars is really a mixture for the food service and ambience as opposed to just the food itself which is more like 3.5. Coming here, I was expecting super amazing, fresh, and delicious food but all the portions were just so tiny it interfered with the enjoyment. The service and ambience is really great though. Out of all the dishes, I liked the unit ramen and the desserts the best. Fish was fresh but again, very expensive for small amount.
Emily S.}Oceanside, CA}8}3}5}-1}1}12/18/2017}Worse attitude I have ever seen from an usher. Food is way overpriced by its quality. There are tons of other better izayakas in the city. Avoid this place by all chance.We asked the usher nicely if our party of four can sit in the booth because the original table was way too small to squeeze in. She gave me the dirtiest look ever and said booths are for parties of six, while there are parties of four sitting in each of the two other booths. We asked again and she basically threw the menu on the desk in the booth - like HELLO I didn't pay $240 for you to give me attitude before I even got seated.Food is extremely average, way overpriced and can be easily replaced by ANY other izayaka in the city. Worst dinning experience in NYC so far. One star for the waiter who was actually nice to us.
Maisy C.}Boston, MA}48}19}38}-1}5}12/17/2017}My New Yorker friend took me to this place after their busier dinner hours, so we didn't have to wait for a table at all. I'm so amazed at their Sake menu, my goodness! Unfortunately neither one of us drinks. Both food and service were excellent. What we got tonight: Gomaae, Gomoku Kinpira, Hirami Ponzu, Gyutan Yawaraka Ni, Surumeika Zukeyaki, Wagyu, Uni Soba, Chocolate Soufflé with Matcha Ice Cream, Sake Panna Cotta
Ken N.}Dublin, CA}1}17}0}-1}2}12/16/2017}Service staff was okay but host staff was down right prejudice against kids. "Not welcome for kids" is an understatement. And the thing is they totally make it known. For dinner fine, understood you want to sell sake. But we went for lunch with a reservation right when they opened at 11:30. Food was fine, but not where it was like damn, I have to eat there again. Overrated.
Veronica W.}New Canaan, CT}0}37}39}-1}5}12/15/2017}Another perfect meal! This is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant. The fish is so fresh, it tastes sweet and smooth. The thickness is just perfect. I took my colleagues here for a year end lunch. We all extremely impressed with the presentation, the taste, the service and of course the saki! Love the Yuzu one. Perfect match with sashimi. Highly recommended. Definitely will bring my friends back here.
Dean C.}Salisbury, MD}6}2}0}-1}4}12/12/2017}Great atmosphere.  Hidden in a basement but hardly a secret as it was packed.Tapas menu, all delicious!
Marios D.}Manhattan, NY}174}440}706}18}5}12/11/2017}I have been here a few times and from the moment I walk through the glass doors on 43rd street I feel like I am in one of the nondescript buildings that has a hidden pot of gold (figuratively of course as I am referring to the food pot of gold...) in it waiting for me to discover. This visit was no different.  The atmosphere smells and tastes like Japan, and it feels really great. The food has always been superb and the service is no different - equally superb, with great attention to detail and pleasing the consumer.  A lesson for all in this business.  We ordered some grilled appetizers to start, which included mostly the vegetables as well as some small fish and fish fillet.  We also enjoyed the eel which was in season and was cooked perfectly - melt in your mouth perfectly.We of course had to wash this down with an appropriate beverage.  The waiter was conversant with the sake menu and choices and helped us pick a medium to upper end sake that was perfume filled and a great accompaniment to the dinner.  The coup de gras was the sushi of course. And it was delivered in ornate settings of seaweed, flowers and other adornments (yea I know - I should have taken pics but I was in the company of the non-pic variety of patrons so could not).  Suffice is to say, the taste and presentation pleased many senses.  What an experienceI highly recommend this place.
Nicholas A.}San Clemente, CA}1}17}8}-1}4}12/8/2017}Hidden downstairs in commercial building, this place was very good with an authentic feel. Service was whatever but decor was very cool and the place was hopping even right at close. Had a bunch of items but the Uni laced cold soba was epic and the beef tongue stew was unreal.
Karen H.}New York, NY}11}184}358}18}4}12/7/2017}Sakagura is located at the basement of an office building. Once you arrive, the mood is instantly transformed into a cozy Japanese restaurant. We were seated without a reservation at 6pm for 4 on a Sunday night. They have an extensive sake list, which comes out in a cute ice bucket with flowers. The waitress was great and gave us suggestions. We ordered various small plates to share such as grilled chicken, chilled roasted duck, sashimi, and pork belly. We also had the rice special of the day which sounded special since it took about an hour to make. It had salmon and roe and the garlic made it delicious. It can get pricey, as items add up, but it was nice to try the different plates.
Isabel L.}New York, NY}257}406}91}-1}3}12/6/2017}Beautiful space and interesting dishes but the service was mediocre at best. Made a reservation 3 weeks prior and my party ended up being seated in the back room. Meanwhile in the main dining room there were several empty tables but they wouldn't give it to us and were being difficult about it. We ended up getting a table in main dining room after persisting, which we shouldn't have had to in the first place. During the meal I also felt rushed to leave, we were supposedly to have the table till 9pm, but by 830 the server already dropped the check. For the price we were paying i wouldn't want to feel like I'm being rushed out like I'm at a fastfood joint ...Overall, not sure if it's worth the hype. Food was ok. Pork belly was a bit tough, beef tongue stew was ok and the portions were not good for sharing
Nina C.}Manhattan, NY}383}108}150}18}4}12/6/2017}Hidden away in the basement of what looks to be an office building, I've passed this place so many times and haven't even noticed. I love the tapas style as it allows you to try many different things. The dishes were all great and super flavorful. Favorites include:- Washu Beef Tataki ($16)- Buta Kauni ($6.8)- Salmon Chirashi ($26)
Robert S.}Stony Brook, NY}187}24}4}-1}3}12/5/2017}3 stars is a bit generous, but I don't like to give less unless the restaurant completely doesn't try.It's one thing for a restaurant to charge more if they are upscale (that's fine), but to order entrees, and then for them to come out the size of appetizers, it's not right. I don't think we were asked once how we liked our food, so the second time our waiter came around, I asked, are these appetizers, or entrees (my euphemism for stating that the portions are very small, especially for the chicken dish)? Instead of acknowledging my concern, the waiter (in a matter a fact voice) stated that most couples will get 5 dishes, which doesn't make sense to me, and if that was the case, I think there should be some sort of disclosure for how to order at this restaurant.Neither the chicken nor salmon were prepared much differently than places I could have gone to for half the price. It isn't even a price analysis, the entrees are just way too small. The decorations of the restaurant were decent, but nothing about the atmosphere makes me rave about it, and there are many many other places I think I could have gone to for almost the same thing (and less money, with bigger portions). Don't pitch dishes we an entree if they aren't. You will disappoint many customers that way. If it's traditional to order multiple "bites", it should be stated as such so your customers know what they are getting themselves into. The food quality was just average in my opinion too, nothing to rave about.I really want to rate this place higher, but I can't.
Phil C.}New Hyde Park, NY}8}8}1}-1}4}12/5/2017}We couldn't get a reservation on a Saturday night.  Hostess told us they have some tables for walk in so we decided to take a chance.  Initially they told us the wait will be one hour but then we got lucky as they had a no show.  When they were ready to seat us, they gave us a 2 hour time slot.  I don't know what happens if you exceed the 2 hours.  Service was fast but not rushed.  As others have mentioned, don't order everything at once.  It may come at once.  Space it out and enjoy!  Although the clock is ticking.  Some highlights...Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago - sublime!Uni Soba - great finisher. Sashimi was great.Wagyu Beef - how can you go wrong.  Grilling it yourself is gimicky but we tried it anyway.  Food was terrific.  Big selection of sake.  Just not sure what happens when you stay past your allotted 2 hour time slot.  I would definitely come back again if I was in the neighborhood.
Kathleen S.}Brooklyn, NY}54}210}350}18}3}12/3/2017}I arrived before the restaurant opened at 11:30AM to ensure I would get one of the lunch specials, as there are only 30 servings each day. I specifically went on a Thursday for the barachirashi don, which, like the other specials, comes with a hot or cold soba (the waitress recommended cold, even though it was very cold outside). While the lunch special for $12 may seem like a good deal, I was unenthused by the offerings. The soba was good, but even with the dipping sauce, plain. Overall the barachirashi included only a small portion of sashimi and not enough to satiate my appetite. Even the sushi rice could have been warmer and softer. The Japanese aesthetic and intimate ambience added to the experience, but I wish there was more sashimi in the barachirashi and could have done with less soba.
Shingo K.}New York, NY}256}14}6}-1}4}12/3/2017}Great place for Japanese food. Loved this place. It's located in a basement-esque and very cozy. A bit pricey but definitely an awesome place for date night. Food is excellent.
Albert H.}Manhattan, NY}254}8}1}-1}1}11/25/2017}Never again. Walked out. Attitude by the host(ess) at check-In. He made it clear we were not welcome and gave us the worst table. Restaurant should be appropriately called Suck-agura. Take your business where you are welcome. Don't waste your time with this restaurant. There are many authentic gems within 500 feet.
Abhishek K.}New York, NY}7}11}0}-1}5}11/24/2017}A great Japanese restaurant disguised in the basement. It's an experience and food tastes very good and its light on your palette too. Portion sizes are small. Do try the Sake (They have tons of variety). SALMON SAIKYO YAKI was amazing.
Jon L.}Brooklyn, NY}153}120}294}-1}4}11/21/2017}Not bad. Came here on a Tuesday for lunch. Kind of a turn off to go down into a basement to eat. There's that stuffy feeling when going into a building then walking down the stairs to go eat, especially when a place's Cost is $$$. The service was good. The servers were attentive and took their job seriously. The food was good, nothing insane. Got the lunch special, some sushi, a noodle soup dish, and finally green tea ice cream. Can't complain about anything, but I'm not thrilled to go back. It's a decent establishment, overall.
Vijay S.}Seattle, WA}33}118}48}18}4}11/20/2017}Great spot for a night of sake tasting and a wide variety of Japanese food that you don't get in a lot of places.Our group got - the dry sake flight- the basic sake flight- the sweet sake flight - a bottle of the narutotai genshuWe also got the grilled octopus and the octopus marinated in octopus liver, grilled eggplant, karage, spinach in sesame, udon noodles and a couple of other dishes that skip my mind.In all fairness, I didn't really have a bite that Bowled me over but would still go back here again and again because of the ambiance and the sake that accompanied the meal.
Katsu D.}Manhattan, NY}13}153}7}-1}1}11/19/2017}Absolutely unreal service. We made a reservation 1 week in advance and when we came the day of, they claimed that we made a reservation for the FOLLOWING MONTH. We had a group of 5 hungry people and were forced to leave, most likely because they probably erased our reservation in favor of some important Japanese shacho. Will NEVER go here again.
Chris S.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}11/18/2017}Everything was amazing - the pork belly melts in your mouth, the sea urchin soba is delicious and the vegetable tempura was perfectly cooked
Angela S.}Manhattan, NY}399}92}45}18}4}11/18/2017}The restaurant is a bit hard to find as it is located inside what seems like an office building. However, you walk downstairs to a cove that transports you to Japan. We got there Friday night without reservations at 5:50PM, right before they opened and there was already a short line. As for food, we ordered the assortment of 5 kinds of sashimi. However, although good, I'd recommend you to skip this and directly order more of the small dishes as those were truly the stars. My absolute favorite was the buta kakuni (stewed pork belly). It was a rather large piece of pork belly that came resting in an extremely flavorful broth. You can literally pull it apart with a knife and every portion of it was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The broth was probably my favorite part of it and I could probably sip it all day. If I could have ten of those, trust me, I would. The other small dishes we ordered such as the tori karaage did not disappoint as well. Also, not to forget, they have an extensive sake menu. As we knew nearly nothing about sake, we asked our server for a recommendation. The sake came displayed in a beautiful glass carafe, placed inside a wooden box and adorned with fresh flowers. Our server was quite attentive in refilling our glasses for us as well. In all, would definitely recommend for their small dishes and sake. Maybe even just their small dishes.
Jessica A.}New York, NY}12}21}3}-1}5}11/17/2017}What a hidden gem! I almost don't want to tell people about this place because it's so special, and a total escape away from midtown NYC. The restaurant itself feels very authentic, and having been to Japan earlier this year, it reminds me of the restaurants there in many ways. The service is great as usual with most Japanese restaurants - no complaints there. I went on a Thursday night and it got crowded quickly, but we luckily got a table for 2 right without reservations at 6:30. We stayed for 3.5 hours (mostly because I was catching up with a friend who I haven't seen in a long time), but they never asked us to leave which felt really nice. It started to empty out around 9, so I'd suggest coming here right when it opens at 6 or later in the night if you want optimal service and less of a crowd.On to the food! We ordered:-Seaweed salad with sesame dressing - Best I've ever had, and not the typical seaweed salad you usually have. You MUST get this as an app!-Hirame Ponzu - Seven slices of Fluke sashimi with a citrus vinaigrette and daikon radish, fish was super fresh and surprisingly felt like a lot for one person to have so you'd probably want to split this as an app as well.-Jidori Shioyaki - Probably my least favorite out of the meal, but I think it's because the chicken was so fresh/organic so I'm not used to that chicken-y / meat-y flavor.-Wagyu Beef special - I forget the name, but it's $35 and you HAVE to get it if you come here. It's about eight slices of beef that you cook on a super hot stone, which you oil up with a block of fat (!!!). The quality of the beef is amazing, and I love the presentation. Feels way classier / less intimidating than KBBQ, although that's also a very different experience.-Chocolate Soufflé - Sooo good, but super small portion for $14. One of my drawbacks for this experience is that the dessert was overpriced.-Black Sesame Ice Cream - one scoop for $5, which is reasonable but small. Get it if you are feeling something light and sweet.Sakagura also has an extended sake list, which was intimidating and made it hard for me to pick one that I'd like. At first our server suggested a sweet wine that felt like dessert wine, which I really could not drink (and I have a pretty forgiving drink palate). She didn't offer to replace the sake, but did recommend me a much better, drier glass that I was fine with. It's hard to find gems like this in midtown east, so I'm for sure coming back!
Jessica W.}Walnut Creek, CA}261}139}292}18}5}11/15/2017}Mouth-watering, classy, and traditional Japanese food. Ambiance: Down several flights of stairs, Sakagura feels thousands of miles away from NYC. The decor and ambiance has a Japanese modern flair that's balanced with earthy wood and bamboo. It's a very open and refreshing setup. The staff are very professional and pleasant which add to the dining experience. Food: Overall everything was delicious. The portions were average but expect to order 2-3 plates/person in order to feel full. Agedashi tofu- Crunchy 3 cubes of tofu drenched in a flavorful sauce. I loved the mushrooms that it came with. Chicken karage- Crunchy and well seasoned exterior. Excellent quality chicken. Salmon Saikyo- beautifully glazed salmon. It was a bit undercooked though with a very pink center. Ribeye Steak- Tender and nearly melted in my mouth. Probably my favorite dish! Black Sesame Creme Brûlée- Unforgettable nutty and creamy Creme Brûlée with ice cream! Highly recommend
mark s.}Manhattan, NY}11}18}5}-1}5}11/12/2017}My favorite new special occasion place. I love the fact that its in the basement of a midtown office building - so Japanese
Lina Y.}Flushing, NY}127}70}55}18}4}11/9/2017}I love Japanese lunch sets, and this one did not disappoint! They have a different set each day; I came on a Thursday and their daily lunch set came with soba (you can choose hot or cold) and a rice bowl that has pieces of salmon, eel, shrimp, and tamago. I was so tasty and was only $12! It gets pretty busy at lunch though. We got here at 11:55 without a reservation and had to wait 15 minutes. Those that arrived after 12 were quoted a 25 minute wait, so definitely come early or make reservations! My friend ordered the oyakodon and they brought out his soba first and mentioned his rice bowl would be another few mins. It was probably 20-30 minutes before his rice bowl finally came. He was finished with his soba already and hungrily watching me eat. They did apologize for the wait and offered us each a scoop of ice cream on the house, which was nice of them. I got the black sesame ice cream - very yummy! Overall, I would highly recommend this spot for a nice lunch with friends.
Drew Z.}Mineola, NY}1}30}2}-1}5}11/9/2017}First time here and I was in heaven with every bite. My date suggested I get the uni ikura onsen, I was so tempted to order seconds.. I wish I had a bigger belly cuz every dish that came out for other patrons, I was like I want that & that & that.. LoL I loved the food& server was so helpful & attentive. I'll definitely be back.
Thibault F.}Lausanne, Switzerland}14}33}3}-1}5}11/3/2017}That gem is hard to find ! But it's definitely worth it. We loved everything about this restaurant from the entrance in a seemingly office building (you have to go down two flights of stairs before reaching the restaurant) to the extensive sake collection. Everything was perfect. The pork belly and seaweed salads were definitely amongst the best dishes we had there. Make sure to book well in advance as this place is hugely popular !
Tory G.}Manhattan, NY}4}95}44}18}5}11/1/2017}I had an amazing dinner here! The food is delicious and the sake selection is huge. I sat at the bar where we had great service with food arriving quickly. One complaint is that they were out of the pork belly when I was there which is something that I really wanted to try. The restaurant is somewhat hidden in the lower level of an office building but not too tough to find.
乃馨}New York, NY}48}74}304}-1}4}11/1/2017}My favorite is the beef stew. It's so tender and the meat absorbs the essence of the soup. Radish and konjac jelly went very well with the stew. Everything else was ok, not amazing or shockingly good, but still pretty ok. The price is a little bit high for the portion, but I guess that's a norm for Japanese food. The shrimp liver for appetizer was too gamy.
Shinbai C.}New York, NY}3}42}10}-1}4}10/29/2017Updatedreview}The portions were definitely small. I tasted and felt the delicacy and detailedness they put in the dish. The choice of sake were abundant and of good quality. However, it lacks depth in their dish and layers from the seasoning/sauces/protein.
t x.}Manhattan, NY}1}55}38}-1}4}10/22/2017}Hidden underground gem in the basement of an office building on 43rd Street across from Sushi Yadira.  Been here a few times already. Classic really good Japanese food. Had the lunch tasting course, chirashi don, and the  Oyakodon. The tasting lunch included some sashimi which was fresh especially the scallop sashimi (one of the best I've had), tempura, soba (very good.....I wonder if they are sourcing it from Soba Totto upstairs?), steak in a sauce (slightly overlooked. Had ordered it medium should have ordered it medium rare but I was sharing with some other people and they don't do medium rare), finished with black sesame ice cream. They have a great sake list which would go well with a lot of the dishes.
Jamie O.}Las Vegas, NV}369}26}1}-1}3}10/20/2017}There was hair in my food. :( The food didn't meet my expectations. It was good, but not amazing. I saw the hair as soon as I got the food so they kindly apologized and made me a new meal. The atmosphere is amazing, though. The interior really makes you feel as if you're somewhere in Japan. Cool little hidden spot.
Blythe B.}Washington, DC}0}37}8}-1}5}10/13/2017}I judge Japanese restaurants by their rice and miso soup - two seemingly simple things. This place has the best rice I've ever had a Japanese restaurant, in the US and in Japan!I would love to have the recipe!
Saylor B.}Bronx, Bronx, NY}1}7}0}-1}5}10/13/2017}The food was great. Service was great too. Good variety and the tapas menu makes it easy to try different things. Only downside was the size of the tables. The wait staff handled it very well though, syncing with the kitchen to bring dishes when there was space.
Urban G.}New York, NY}9}155}0}-1}4}10/12/2017}YUM! I was introduced this this magnificent little oasis under the city and went back for dinner with my beloved the very next day. Food is delicious! Service is professional and efficient. I recommend the pork belly, black cod, eel and cucumber salad, and the seaseme desert. I could go on but those are the dishes I found most tasty. The restaurant also has a tasty sake seletion. :) Happy dining!
Maia E.}Burlington, Canada}43}177}1157}18}5}10/10/2017}The first time I came here was a year ago for dinner this time I came for lunch. For dinner the menu is different than the lunch menu. This place is tucked away in the basement of an office building. Cute little restaurant with unique Japanese decor. Very authentic. The dinner menu consists of a lot of tapa dishes. Very unique but you have to order a lot to be full. We went for lunch this time around. We ordered the tempura to share and it was delicious. I ordered the bbq eel on a bed of rice and my boyfriend ordered the Japanese curry udon noodleSoup with slices of duck. Both lunch specials were delicious and so flavourful.  Service was amazing. Would definitely come back next time I'm in NYC!
Deborah L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}10/8/2017}A hidden gem! Ambience was surprisingly pleasant for a restaurant in a basement -- high ceilings, warm and woodsy décor.  I particularly loved the Ornsen Tamago -- soft boiled egg with sea urchin and salmon roe in soup. I also recommend the Gindara Yuan Yaki, grilled black cod with sweet soy sauce. It's perfectly cooked and has just the right amount of flavor. As Sakagura isn't a sushi bar, the sashimi was fine but not mind-blowing.Although I'm not usually a fan of crème brûlée, I followed the advice of other Yelpers and ordered the black sesame crème brûlée. I was not disappointed! It was delicious and not overly sweet. Overall a great place to visit when you're in the mood for Japanese but not necessarily sushi.
Yue L.}Northfield, MN}88}116}36}-1}5}10/7/2017}sakugura is close to grand central. We came at lunch time and ordered the eel over rice and jewel bento. Both were super delicious. Eel was soft and juicy. Sashimi was very fresh. There're also many other lunch specials to choose from.
Ann T.}Houston, TX}1}6}2}-1}5}10/4/2017}Please note: I have only been here once in what was slightly a rush but I can tell you that I was impressed with this unassuming spot - it left a sweet tingle in my heart :) It's definitely a lively restaurant I'd say perfect to meet up with friends or family! I didn't do any of the ordering but may I suggest trying to snag a bowl of the uni soba! O. M. G. We were all fighting for this one hehehe. Uniiiiiiiii! Great memories. Satisfied taste buds. Happy heart.
John A.}United Kingdom}0}14}29}-1}1}10/4/2017}Kiosuku at the 1st floor is suck, a woman who works there as a cashier is terrible, bad service. Obviously she is Japanese, i have never seen a Japanese female with such poor attitude. The launch boxes and snacks selling are nice, but  i will never visit again, just because her poor, terrible attitude.
Christina P.}Brooklyn, NY}4606}1995}3629}18}5}10/3/2017}One of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time! Thank goodness I read some Yelp reviews before meeting my family here, or else I would have never known to go into the basement of a boring-looking office building to get to this dimly lit Japanese oasis. Before we were seated for our reservation, the hostess let us know that we had 2 hours til the next party arrived. At first I thought that was weird, but once the meal started I realized how quickly 2 hours could pass, and I appreciated the heads up. We ordered items off of each section of the menu, and there really were no duds in the whole meal. Some of my favorites included:- seaweed salad (sounds generic but it had a great variety of seaweed and a tasty dressing that made it unique)- Sashimi sampler (simple, but very high quality)- raw octopus with wasabi- roasted eggplant with three types of miso - ebi sticks (the only fried item we got and a nice crunchy change in flavor)- grilled rice ball with mackerel (this was one I didn't think I'd like but it ended up being one of my favorites)- Nihachi soba (the soba was so well cooked and al dente in a way I don't think I've ever had before)- sake panna cotta - black sesame creme bruleeAs you can see, the menu ranges greatly and all of it goes great with one of the many sakes on the menu. That's actually what they're known for (same owners as Sake Bar Decibal in the East Village). I know nothing about sake but I liked that they let us sample a couple until we found the perfect one for us. It was a great place to have a leisurely and adventurous meal - best to come with people who are willing to try new things and love all Japanese food. Will definitely come back here for a special occasion!
Wayne L.}New York, NY}206}35}17}-1}5}9/28/2017}I might have discovered my new favorite Japanese restaurant in NYC! Hidden in the basement of an office building, Sakagura has the ambience of an izakaya, serving sake alongside Japanese tapas.We tried a variety of dishes but I would recommend the Unisoba, Yaki Sanma Onigiri, Agedashi Tofu, and my favorite their simple Atsuyaki Tamago - Japanese omelette.It is a little pricey and like all places serving "tapas" I don't recommend it if you're starving.
Eatamame N.}New York, NY}0}67}182}-1}3}9/23/2017}Love this place so much! Totally worth it to come during lunch time because they have more food and during the night it's more like tapas. But, the service is a bit too slow.
Pranesha B.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}2}-1}3}9/18/2017}We went for lunch. Very helpful, kind staff. Tempura did not meet my standard. Not good for the tempura maker to drizzle sauce over the tempura in the serving tray. It arrived at the table somewhat soggy. Rather serve the tempura crispy and let the diner dip it in sauce if preferred.
Alice A.}Brooklyn, NY}174}43}53}18}3}9/18/2017}I read about this place in several blogs that listed the best izakayas in NYC. So I decided to take my family there who love izakayas. The space was beautiful. Although it was tucked inside the basement of an office building, the restaurant space was large with high ceilings. The central decoration of the space was the long counter table with a shelf behind that had blue and green glass sake bottles lined up. They complimented the wood heavy architecture. Their sake collection was impressive. Our waiter knew his sake well and recommended us ones that complimented the meal very well. But sadly the food was a bit disappointing as it was pretty different from Japanese food that I am accustomed to. We got the deep fried pork which had no flavor, grilled nasu with three kinds of sauces that were way too sweet, daikon salad with the daikon cut badly, shishito age, ika shiokara, and shirasu oroshi. However, the dessert was delicious!! We shared the chocolate souffle and the sesame cream brulee. They were both perfectly baked and not too sweet. I recommend this place for a date because of the beautiful atmosphere but probably will not take my family again because the food (except for dessert!) was not the best.
Angeline C.}Singapore, Singapore}34}8}2}-1}5}9/8/2017}I was there on a Friday for lunch and while the restaurant was quiet at 1130am, it filled up quickly by noon. We ordered the Friday lunch set (beef hash rice and cold soba) and the 5 course tasting lunch menu. Everything was superb, my favorites are the beef hash rice from the lunch menu, and tempura and grilled fish from the tasting course. Will be back!
Sunah K.}New York, NY}83}145}86}18}2}9/4/2017}I came here with some co-workers at lunch because Sakagura has such great reviews. I was disappointed with the food and the service was strange.Making a reservation here over the phone is a PAIN. They don't answer their phone 50% of the time. I made a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time. I called a few days before to confirm and they said the reservation was non-existent, but they'd make space for me. Then we get there and they can't find our reservation. What am I missing here?Moving onto the food, they have little sets that you order. Given that we were hungry, we decided to order several sets and split them. We tried a summer special that's something similar to Korean naengmyun (but is 10x worse...the flavor was so strange). At the beginning, we ordered the same dish (all 4 of us)...it was a set that had dumplings and Japanese dishes and just a large assortment. After waiting 20-30 minutes, the server returns and tells us there is only one left. That's fine, but shouldn't you know that when we're ordering our food and are a on a schedule and need to get back to work soon?Moving on...we decide to then go with the "order whatever we want and split it" plan. Our server repeatedly asks us if we're sure, because it's a lot of food. I appreciate her being kind about it and her being worried that we ordered too much, but after asking us once? It's enough. She asked us 3-5 times...at different moments. It became ridiculous to the point where we had to tell her to stop.In the end, she compensated one of our sets because we waited so long for all our food due to the mix-up at the beginning (where the sets just were all gone). But that was the only stand-out moment that lunch.Would pass on the opportunity to come here again.
Jayson C.}Jamaica, NY}12}160}403}18}4}9/4/2017}Its is in lower basement (2 levels) with huge mask & Sake Barrels decorations.  The lunch had many different choices of Set lunches.  The Assorted Tempera soba set lunch was good (not too oily), shrimp, fish, vegetable tempura with very delicious soba..Lunch Bento Special was $23 and definitely presentation was impressive. My co-workers said the sushi was above average but some of the rice roll was nothing special.  Overall still a very good lunch set.The main negative here , there is no in house Wi-fi and cell receptions was non existing.2 of us has  ATT wireless & Cricket cell phone had 0 bars.  My other coworkers has Tmobile and had 1 bar.  no one in our group have Verizon ( so we don't know ).  Unfortunately , I wanted to eat faster worry to miss some important work calls.. So probably not as relax as I like.Chocolate Souffle was 10 mins wait , it was okay but nothing that blew me away.
Kuunal M.}Manhattan, NY}40}2}0}-1}5}9/3/2017}Great place  with a staff that knows the dishes.You can not go wrong with selecting anything form the udon set section. I usually go for the daily special.
Athena S.}Ithaca, NY}366}68}4}-1}5}9/3/2017}One of my favorite Japanese spots in NYC. Hidden in the basement of an office building, Sakagura definitely gives you a glimpse of the dining scene in Japan. Be warned that there usually is a wait, so reservations are highly suggested. Even if you do have to wait, I'd suggest it because the food is definitely worth it. Sauagura has a wide selection of sake for you to try. This is in addition to the huge number of menu items that they have available. Favorites include the braised pork belly and the uni pasta. The pork is deliciously fatty, fall apart and very well seasoned. The uni pasta is deliciously creamy, with a good helping of uni and a perfect al dente bite to the pasta. While a little on the pricey side, again a definitely must try if you love Japanese food.
Dreadnaught D.}Fremont, CA}0}41}89}-1}4}9/2/2017}Continue to eat my way around NYC on this long weekend trip. This was like a tapas like dining experience with descent dishes & great home made desserts. Our favorite dish was the braised pork belly in a light broth. It was tender, succulent with just enough of the fatty top layer. Chicken karaage above average, not too salty while stays juicy inside. Eel with sliced cucumber & seaweed was light & refreshing. Steamed chicken with veges (mushrooms, carrots, bamboo) was interesting, it was light, but there was only 1 small piece of chicken and it was rather blend & tough. The grilled black cod was way too salty. Soba was light & not much flavor even with the dipping dauce but thats true for most soba.The highlights of this meal were the desserts. Since they were of small portions we ordered 3 desserts. Chocolate souffle was absolutely heavenly, beneath the thin toasted crust lies the hot, silky and velvety melted chocolates. I can go there just eat that everyday. The black sesame with ice cream was good. I tried the red bean Manju cake for the first time served with green tea ice cream and thought it was ok. Price was a bit of a shock for non New-Yorkers so be warned. 6 small dishes & 3 desserts came to about $131 pre-tax.
Janet J.}New York, NY}328}201}370}18}2}9/1/2017}I was anticipating our visit but was let down by mediocre food.Came for lunch time and some dishes were great, but some were thumbs down. *Kaisen don set: Fresh pieces of sashimi over seasoned rice. Good variety fish and quality was quite good. Cold soba noodles came out kind of sticky and over cooked. Not sure if it was because we came at 1:30pm for lunch service, but noodles were not cooked well! --Tempura soba: Comes with 4-5 pieces of tempura. Well battered and cooked. Soba broth was extremely salty. Didn't have that dashi taste or hearty broth either. Seemed like they just scraped it out of a big pot. Soba noodles kept on breaking as I tried to eat them, indicating that they are either overcooked or old? Thumbs down on this one! Additionally, the miso soup was very dark in both color and taste. This too was way too salty and seemed like we got the tail end of the pot. Service was good and although some parts of our meal was okay, some dishes were not. I would like to come back, but based on my previous experience, I am saddened :(
Marshall L.}Brooklyn, NY}225}57}64}-1}4}8/31/2017}Very authentic Japanese restaurant. You literally feel you are in Japan. The sake menu is unbelievably outrageous. It's thicker than the math book( you will love it if you are sake specialist). Food are very detail but it's bit pricey for the tapa portion. It's kind of turn me down a bit to pay so much for everyday food.
Jennifer F.}Manhattan, NY}0}25}0}-1}5}8/31/2017}Had the immense pleasure of visiting Sakagura last night. The entire experience was incredible, from the moment we entered, to the moment we tasted the amazing flavors. In an area like midtown, where great and unique restaurants seem to be far and few between, Sakagura is pleasantly hidden in the heart of it. Highly recommend! We sat at the bar and were taken care by Ai, who did an amazing job at making sure we had the best experience possible. Will definitely be back. Favorites of the night: fluke carpaccio with olive oil and salmon roe, black cod entree, hot udon noodles.
Kalie K.}Phoenix, AZ}28}7}0}-1}4}8/28/2017}What a gem in the middle of Midtown East. Love the discrete location in the basement of a corporate office building. Feels like you're going somewhere very exclusive. The sake menu is overwhelming but the waitress made a great recommendation for us. For a party of three, we ended up with six total dishes. Three smaller or lighter, two bigger / meatier and one OUTSTANDING dessert. The homemade mochi and green tea ice cream cannot be missed. This was the prefect quantity of food for us. Quality was top-notch and the pricing isn't asinine. We will certainly return.
Linshan J.}Goleta, CA}110}45}142}18}4}8/27/2017}It is underground which is a little bit hard to find. But the decorations are very special.The desserts are great. We ordered the black sesami and sake manju. The latter is a red bean manju with the flavor of wine.The dishes are also good. The black edamome is my first time to have.
Yulu H.}New York, NY}4}133}177}-1}3}8/26/2017}Waited 30 min even though we had reservation... love their lunch options (don and soba combo) but the dinner options were so so. Ordered pot rice last time (seasonal dish) it was plenty of rice with very little mushrooms and flavors - quite disappointed. This place is better for ppl come and have a drink and some tiny dishes but not for ppl who are seriously looking for a good dinner. Love their decor very much though.
Michelle J.}Roslyn Heights, NY}6}90}214}18}1}8/24/2017}The lady I talked to on the phone to make a reservation hung up on me twice. She said she doesn't accept reservations 1 hour in advance so I was trying to ask her how far in advance I'd have to make it and she hung up on me. The second time she says you'll just have to come and wait, didn't answer my question and hung up on me again.Plenty of other better sushi restaurants around with much better service. Clearly they do not care about customers here.
Nimrod B.}Monterey, CA}15}3}1}-1}4}8/23/2017}A beautiful place with a super-authentic food. Small dishes and a bit pricey but worth every penny. It's not a  quite and romantic place but a place to hang with friends and family though it's not suitable for kids.
Halina W.}Manhattan, NY}0}5}0}-1}1}8/23/2017}They were rude. I shyly asked when they would open at 557pm and they said "6, sit outside" and shut the door in my face. Sorry but I wasn't to know, was just asking. Thanks but no thanks, it's not that good. Been to better. And the toilet is dirty.
Jimmy J.}Brooklyn, NY}22}8}0}-1}5}8/22/2017}I have been a loyal customer for over ten year. Amazing sake selection and good traditional Japanese fare. I bring my friends who have had good Japanese cuisine before to this spot, always two thumbs up. The atmosphere is classy and the service is consistent.
Natalia R.}New York, NY}159}115}277}18}4}8/22/2017}This is a true NY hidden gem.  It's located inside a building in the basement. Don't worry it doesn't smell or look like a basement. The decor was bold and gave me the feeling of being in Asia. My co worker said this place has very authentic food. I was very pleased with the food and service. They have lunch specials that change every day. I had the thinly sliced beef and onions simmered in said and soy sauce over white rice.  I thought the stake was cooked to perfection. I plan to come back on Mondays to get it again. This  place is known for their sake. Unfortunately I came during work hours and could not indulge in the fun.  Next time for sure. I will update my experience then.
Taka K.}Lexington, MA}61}16}89}-1}5}8/19/2017}Visited there a few weeks back and I loved this place. They offer authentic Japanese food, and this is one of the must go place if you are looking for traditional authentic Japanese food in reasonable price. And they have so many kinds of Sake (Nihonshu).I will definitely visit this place again
Vincent L.}Oakland, CA}362}3260}7970}18}2}8/15/2017}Sakagura came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine who's studied in Japan and does business there a lot, but somehow my experience didn't quite sing. Maybe I had an unusual experience, as this place is clearly popular (reservations are highly recommended), but nothing quite rose to the occasion, even before taking the prices into account.A sashimi combo bowl, consisting of red snapper, sea bream, tuna, amberjack, and scallop was beautifully presented and modestly sized, but the only items that were particularly satisfying were the amberjack and the scallop. In particular, I'm not sure if this is commonplace for good sashimi and/or sushi establishments, but my pieces of tuna were a bit hard to chew because, upon closer examination, there was a line of what looked like connective tissue running through each of them.It's probably a better idea to get an assortment of their smaller hot dishes. Their "signature dish," the buta kakuni (pork belly), was a compact serving of deliciously fatty, meaty, and chewy goodness, complemented with a pleasantly sweet sauce. Meanwhile, the tori karaage (fried chicken thigh) was fried just a bit too crunchy for my tastes, but not so much so to spoil the whole dish or warrant sending it back. Besides the food, they're perhaps best known for their encyclopedic sake selection, and the entire length of the bar is stocked with sake bottles and custom sake vessels. As for service, it was all a transactional, remote experience that lacked the genuine hospitality you'd see in Japan itself. The restaurant has been around a long time and therefore attracts a strong following, but perhaps it's gotten a bit complacent and is resting on its laurels too much.
Tanya Z.}New York, NY}369}334}600}18}5}8/11/2017}My bf surprised me here. I'd recommend reserving early because at the last min we could only get a table for 9 pm on a Friday night. One of the more spacious restaurants in NYC styled with a cool traditional w/ a modern look!This is Japanese tapa style do dishes are definitely smaller and to share. We ordered on the light side so only got 4 dishes: grilled eggplant with 3 miso paste. Grilled squid. Black cod. And the pork belly. We also got the black sesame creme brûlée w/ sesame ice cream for dessert and it is SOOOOOO GOOOD!!!!!!! $14 for this dish and very much worth it. They do sesame 3 ways. In the creme brûlée, in the ice cream, and on top with a toasted sesame garnish. So rich and tasty. One of our faves for the night. Bill came out to about $85 after tax tip for 2 ppl. Again, we def ordered on the lighter side because we snacked a little earlier. Service was also fast, concise and friendly!!
D C.}New York, NY}0}46}0}-1}5}8/10/2017}Amazing Japanese restaurant in a very cool space.  The service is excellent and everything I had there has been amazing.  Definitely one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I have found in New York.  It can get a bit pricey, but considering the quality, it is very fair.A very unique find with amazing food.
Shirly S.}Brooklyn, NY}2}80}396}-1}5}8/7/2017}It's such an interesting place. Hidden inside the basement of an office building. Who would ever know.The sashimi here is amazingly fresh! For those who are used to rolls and sushi. ..this is not the place for you. I went in expecting platter or combo options. There are no rolls or sushi combos. Actually, their menu is quite small but it's amazing. I hear that the lunch menu is really good.I will try to come back for lunch one day!Excellent find!
Mika B.}Beacon, NY}8}24}18}-1}5}8/7/2017}I had a very wonderful experience here! Look for the sign on the building that says Sakagura, and once inside, the very kind security guard will direct you to the restaurant. I didn't expect the ambience to be as great as it was, and I was very impressed!It gives off a semi-fancy kind of a vibe and the decor is beautiful throughout. The undergroundness of it all was very, very cool. The restaurant was spacious and did not feel stuffy, despite being in a basement. Our server was helpful and attentive. The food came out relatively quickly whenever it was ready, sometimes one at a time, but that was okay. I enjoyed everything I ordered, it was very authentic, delicious, and full of flavor. We ordered appetizers and entrees without spending an excessive time waiting for food as it sometimes is here in the city.   I loved this place and am definitely excited to return!
Richard M.}London, United Kingdom}22}97}154}18}4}8/6/2017}A solid four, wouldn't know it was there if it wasn't for the help of yelp. Nice feel to the place,  made like some places in Japan even. Food was pretty good, went for the signature pork belly and some sashimi etc. Plus a sake flight. Not the best Japanese food I've had, not super stand out but pretty solid.
Kathy D.}La Crosse, WI}1}14}10}-1}5}8/2/2017}The walk to the basement is initially very sketchy. Someone made the comment that it would seem creepy to bring a date there during a first encounter..... BUT once you make it down the stairs, the ambiance is quite nice and makes you forget you're in a basement. The food was good. Salmon was fresh. The small tapas-esque portions came out at a comfortably staggered rate. Would recommend.
Lorelei D.}New York, NY}60}1170}1133}-1}5}8/2/2017}Simply amazing. Great food, lots of sake and atmosphere galore.
Dimitrios D.}Queens, NY}56}269}268}18}5}7/30/2017}Sakagura is a really well decorated and tasty Japanese restaurant.  It's hidden in the basement of a midtown building and you pass a security guard booth and go down a stairwell before reaching the restaurant's main door.  Once inside, the place is adorned with pine tree branches coming off of walls and bamboo dividers to give the impression that you're in some secluded Japanese garden or something of the like.  Their bar is long and chock full of large bottles of sake.  Above our table was a maybe five foot tall Japanese face mask of some sort.  Service is friendly and efficient, and all of the food and sake I tried were delicious. Some items I recommend are: Salmon sashimiBlack cod Tuna tartare Fluke ponzu
Panyi D.}Philadelphia, PA}61}1}0}-1}1}7/29/2017}Worst experience ever. Refuse to pack a whole new of Salmon Kon to go. You pay for the food and you can't enjoy it to go when you in a hurry? Unbelievable.
Ren O.}New York, NY}9}183}530}-1}5}7/23/2017}I had visited Sakakura a few years ago, and remembered the delicious grilled meats.Happy to report that the quality is still high.I also like the 'underground' ambiance.We had the maguro (tuna) tartare, followed with some lightly grilled spinach (appetizer size). Then we ordered some grilled ribeye, very yummy.Also ordered the special dish: Miyazaki beef on hot stone. Absolutely fantastic.No drink this time but extensive Sake list.
Sunny C.}New York, NY}72}114}67}18}4}7/21/2017}This place is a gem, hidden from the rest of the chaos that midtown. Their atmosphere is very cool, leaning toward a classier ambience. We had a reservation but were seated at the bar. It was a fun and delicious experience as we picked different small plates off the menu. We actually thought it was sushi place but were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. You must order the duck. Loved that the food was well seasoned without being overly sweet or salty. Highly highly recommend.
Maddie H.}Manhattan, NY}171}70}41}-1}5}7/16/2017}The restuarant is a bit hard to find. It's the basement of an office building. There's construction going on around the area and construction workers may ask if you're headed to the restuarant or not. But the decorations in side are awesome. The bathroom itself is in a large sake barrel. The food here was great. Expect to order a number of dishes to be shared as it is tapas style. They recommend 6 dishes per two people. Each dish is quite expensive, especially for the amount of food you get. But the quality of the meats are great as well as the sashimi. We came as a party of 2 on a Saturday night for dinner While there was no line, it seemed that almost all the tables were already reserved so definitely make sure to make a reservation before hand.  This place is actually known for as one of the top sake bars in the city so make sure to try their sake! They're menu was huge but the waiter was able to make a great recommendation for us. The sake was aesthetically served in a bamboo bottle.
Cindy R.}Rye, NY}0}50}109}-1}5}7/16/2017Updatedreview}It's located at the basement of a midtown east office building.  Nice decor and friendly service. Everything is tasty and authentic.  Chawanmuashi is one of my favorites and sashimi is very fresh.
Jenny K.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}7/14/2017}This experience was very hurtful. I've been living in NYC for very long time like 20 years, and I know my city, and this was the worst of the worst. All I wanted was a nice relaxing dinner with my cousin from out of town. My cousin was visiting me for a few days from LA. I planned a nice dinner for her here and made a reservation a few days ago for 8:30 pm. And, we were there on time, then, we had to wait for more than 30 min. And, we were waiting patiently, and no host was paying attention to us, so I went and ask how much longer we had to wait. They could have just said that they were sorry that we had to wait, and we would sit soon... then, it could have been all good. Instead, this host started yelling at us and giving her hand to talk to us, and it was very condescending, and she was not just being rude, but acting crazy as if we were some type of trash asking something crazy. This was such a shocking experience, and very hurtful. I'll never go there again because it was the worst of the worst of all in NYC. I know this place is popular, but it doesn't mean that they can treat their customers like trash. The customers go there and make their business happen. They need to appreciate that more than anything. This was mentally very hurtful, and it can't really heal how much I felt hurt. I really hope that this place becomes less popular, and they realize that they could have been nice to people when they were doing well.  Always, when you are doing well, and you become full of everything... and it's a second that you could lose everything, and it's too late. Please, please, do not go there unless you want to ruin your Friday night with your precious people.
SH K.}Brooklyn, NY}59}2}0}-1}1}7/14/2017}I want to give zero star. This restaurant was by far the worst experience living in NYC as a professional designer for 20 years. I made a reservation 3 days prior to today at 8:30 pm which was later than I wanted have. Then, we had to wait till 9 pm even if I have made a reservation. We were patiently waiting for 30 min, and I went to check with the host about how long we had to wait. And, she started saying F words and saying racist comments in Japanese restaurant. This was such a shocking experience. This host was crazy and treated the customers like trash. I highly recommend that you do not go there. There millions of fabulous restaurants in NYC. This was the worst experience of my life. I can't understand this situation. I'll never go there again. It was mentally very very hurting. The worst.
Plain White T.}New York, NY}1}323}113}-1}4}7/14/2017}First of all, I love the location of this restaurant.  It feels so secluded because of its location in the basement of an office building, and it's actually a nice thing to get zero phone reception down there.  Once you enter, the inside has a nice ambiance.  My friend and I shared a lunch tasting course which came with noodles, sushi, grilled fish (so good), and steak filet (so good).  It also came with a sake pairing.  My other friend ordered a Don bowl that could easily feed two.  The service was attentive the entire time, and the staff was friendly.
R J.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}15}1}-1}4}7/11/2017}Fun speakeasy style entrance.Good food.Sake to try for days, presented very nicely at the table. Great place to take out of town friends. Make a reservation to avoid the usual wait.Recommendation: Pork Belly.
Joyce K.}Jersey City, NJ}0}13}12}-1}5}7/6/2017}Probably my first 5-star rating for a restaurant because I keep coming back and it never disappoints me! The dishes I always order are consistent in quality, and new dishes I try exceed my expectations! I ALWAYS come back for the uni soba which is honestly, the best uni soba in NYC. The uni is always fresh, sweet and in generous quantity. Somehow the garnishings included in the dish make it taste very refreshing and the uni soup is just amazing. (The only other place I go to for uni soba is Sobaya but it's more expensive there). New dishes I try include the various lunch specials they have which is super value for money and always leave me with a food coma. Heads up, the barachirashi don here is better and fresher than that at Soba Totto. Just fork out $2 extra for a better tasting set! All in all, I absolutely love this place.
Tung D.}New York, NY}337}302}523}18}3}7/2/2017}Expensive, and I only liked 1 dish out of the 5 dishes that we ordered for dinner. Dock one star for the expensiveness.We came on a rainy evening and still had to wait ~20 minutes for a table for 3 people.We ordered the hot-stoned Wagyu beef on the special menu, the grilled squid, the chicken kaarage, the makerel wrapped rice ball (Yaki Sanma Onigiri), and the hot Udon.The Wagyu beef was sooooo good! The fat jewels were distributed evenly along the piece of meat, that, after being sizzly cooked on the hot stoned, the beef texture was slightly bouncy, slightly crunchy, slightly tender, and not at all chewy! And the meat wasn't overwhelmingly fatty at all. It tasted so clean that it tasted almost like white meat. Almost like fatty salmon or a high grade pork. The meat reminded me of the pan-fried goat breast meat that I used to love back in Vietnam in the goat hotpot. The hot stone made the experience even more interesting, and adding a bit of rock salt, a bit of wasabi, a bit of soy sauce, and a bit of lime made the taste even more exciting. It was such a good dish.However that was the only dish that I liked. The grilled squid and kaarage were a salty. The chicken kaarage was pretty average. The makeral wrapped onigiri was a-ok, and the hot udon was nothing special: Just light thin broth with a hint of lime, that was served with some fresh noodles, and topped with only 1 or 2 fish cakes.Overall, my experience was pretty underwhelming for such an expensive dinner. $114 including tips + tax, and the portions were quite small. We didn't have any drinks.I will have to come back for lunch to see if it will change my opinion.PS: the restaurant was a bit hidden so it was fun to try to find it. Reminded me of the many times that I had to go find a speakeasy.
Agnes H.}Minneapolis, MN}5}67}298}18}3}7/2/2017}I came here on a Sunday night at around 7:30 pm without a reservation. I was seated right away at the bar. The service was very minimal and honestly I felt like my server was quite rude. I ordered the pork belly, the cold soba, the onsen egg, and the chawamushi. The pork belly - I had trouble "cutting" it into smaller pieces. Are we supposed to eat the whole thing in one bite? I think the idea is to braise the pork belly long enough that the skin softens up, but it was not the case here. The skin was softened up, but not soft enough to be cut by chopsticks and they do not provide any knives either. The good thing is, the seasoning was done right. It was quite tasty. I could see myself eating it with a bowl of rice. The Cold Soba Noodle - I liked it, but it was just a normal soba noodle you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. Nothing really stood out but it was not bad either.The Onsen Egg - the egg was cooked right. They ran out of uni the night that I ordered it so they put extra ikura in mine. I would like to try the Ikura-uni combination. I would order it again. The Chawamushi - not my favorite. Very blend and tasteless (which tasted the same as the one I got across from the street at Sushi Yasuda). I'm used to the chawamushi with a much more flavorful broth (with the egg mixture), so I was really disappointed that the chawamushi here was so tasteless.I do not think I'll come back here again as I did not enjoy my meal.
Nadia S.}Mountain View, CA}125}113}135}18}4}6/30/2017}I like this place, although I feel it was a bit overpriced and very hyped!! Many of my friends have been talking about it for a long time - so I decided to try it one day.. Went with a friend of mine, and we were lucky enough to get seated pretty fast - without reservations.. Staff was friendly and food was good!! I mean, don't get me wrong, it was really good, and I liked it a lot.. But we also payed 70-80$ per person, and didn't even get that much.. But it was good and interesting - and if I've visitors in town, I'd consider taking them here, as it's a nice experience!
Mohammad m.}Manhattan, NY}5}41}111}-1}1}6/26/2017}We had been to this restaurant once before and liked the food, so decided to try it again. We got there shortly before they close the kitchen. They sat us and allowed us to order. We ordered edamame and their Sashimi selection and sake. They quickly brought the edamame and the sake, and after 15 mins, the waitress asked us if we want anything else. We reminded her that we had ordered sashimi. Apparently, she had forgotten to write down that order and thought we are only ordering edamame, and then informed us that it's already too late to order any food. No serious apology or something to make up for this was offered. This level of service is simply unacceptable.
Kaye S.}New York, NY}0}6}0}-1}1}6/22/2017}Completely over rated. I've been to much better Japanese restaurants. Lunch average is about $25.00 per person. Service is so so as they think they're doing us a favor by eating in their restaurant. After lunch I was still hungry. Me thinks not!
David W.}New York, NY}74}134}583}18}3}6/15/2017}I must start off by saying I base my review on the comparison between Soba Totto's BaraCharashi Special.  The only thing equal that both the soba noodles were good, but Sakaguru was not equal in anything else.The place was out of the way to the point a person looking to randomly eat here would probably not since it's so hidden.  The restaurant itself had a pretty spacious feel to it with a very long bar section.Things I noted:The Chirashi ratio of rice to toppings was way off. The seafood pieces were very small and the rice was hard and tasted a bit off.The service was also not that good.  My tea was never refilled and even getting the check was a bit of a chore.  Although we said we would not have any dessert, we were never presented the check.  It was a bit frustrating to compare places, but it was inevitable due to the it being right next to each other and eating basically the same dish.Sakagura didn't have edamame, but gave some pickled vegetable (cabbage?).  Also didn't include a salad.In this subterranean spot, there's no cell service, so be aware of that in case you're a Doctor or someone who's on call for emergencies.  If you're not, then good and stop looking at your phone and pay attention to your food or the person in front of you.Sakagura also costs a bit more at $12, which seems like a good value but I didn't feel it was worth that.
Brady H.}Evanston, IL}31}4}7}-1}5}6/12/2017}Whole meal was fantastic but the pork belly...just wow...Best pork belly I've ever had. And I've had a lot.
carlos a.}ASTORIA, NY}1}13}0}-1}5}6/11/2017}Love, love this place!!! Best Japanese food in the city and I love the entire decor of the place. If you have a friend from out of town coming please give this place a shot it's a wonderful experience with great service.
Ching S.}Fremont, CA}1}5}0}-1}2}6/9/2017}Very expensive so-so Japanese food.  I was coming myself on a Wednesday night, the ladies in front let me waiting for more than 25 minutes, and they let two couples coming behind me to seat first before me. The portion of food were very little.  I tried raw octopus, which was good.  I also tried the grilled cod, not good at all.  I guess I should not go to a Japanese restaurant in NYC.
Tina W.}New York, NY}421}905}1193}18}5}6/8/2017}Location: It would be a nightmare if you come here the first time on a rainy day. But it's okay： trust yelp location and you will find the doorman, who will direct you to the basement of SAKAGURAYeah, this place is hidden in the basement, suggesting that your phone signal will be pretty much under "no service" scenarioFood： came here twice. both ordered plum wine - their plum wine is the best in the city, I assure you.And ordered all theri desserts - I suggest you try everthing since everything is greatHad their tofu - wonderfulChicken - wonderfulThe place also is great if you are on a date or want to hangout with old friends.Price: okayservice: okayOverall: damn, I forgot to tell you that their bathroom had the japanese hot toielt. so great and comfySHOULD TRY !!ANYWAYIt's a place worth going if you are in town and looking for Japanese food.
Liz S.}New York, NY}636}530}1003}18}4}6/8/2017}Sakagura is an experience in the best of ways. You walk into a sterile office building and let the security guard wave you on through to a door leading down some concrete stairs. There you'll find an izakaya oasis, with lots of wood, flowers, and traditional Japanese touches. Feels like entering a very stylish cave.When the two of us arrived right after 8, we were told there was a 10 minute wait (on the way over, I had been told 30), and were seated shortly afterward at the bar. There were several empty seats and tables when we were seated and by the time we left (around 11) it was maybe a third full.The sake list is significantly larger than the menu, not that the menu is anything to sneeze at. I'm used to tasting notes on menus so this very long and unmarked list was intimidating, but the category headers were still helpful. I had a junmai daiginjo from Kyoto that was crisp and delicious. Sakes start around $10 a glass and go up from there. Lots of picks in the teens. Would bet that they would be happy to guide you if you need help navigating.My friend actually ended up going with a soba beer, which didn't have much of a strong buckwheat taste; was pretty comparable to American wheat beers. Still refreshing. I am so in love with the glassware here-- they use simple and elegant cups for sake by the glass and beer but they had an eclectic set behind the bar and people doing bottles had some very cool cups.Prices on the menu are not as jaw-dropping as some Yelpers have suggested. Many things came in at $10 or under. Yes, the portions are small, but it's possible to cobble a reasonable meal together for $20-30. One note is that the prices listed on the menu on Google are off. Our dishes:- Chikuzen Ni: Stewed traditional Japanese root vegetables with chicken. And I mean chicken singular, as in one very small piece of chicken. The vegetables were great and reminded me of my time in Koyasan, the chicken was good, and the broth was hearty. Just be aware that this is basically just vegetables.- Surumeika Zukeyaki: Grilled squid, awesome! Served as a whole squid sliced into slices on the plate. Perfect flavor and texture, and a squeeze of lemon was all it needed. A little less funky than the one I had at Yopparai in LES, but still earthy and smoky. Home run.- Hirame Ponzu: Fluke sashimi with grated daikon in yuzu sauce. I didn't like this, but my friend was happy. Didn't taste like super high quality fish and was a bit dry. Good if you rolled it together with the daikon and squirted generously with lemon.- Nasu Degaku: Grilled eggplant dressed with three different sauces. I had some of the best one (according to my friend) and it was pretty awesome. Good pick for veggies.We also went for dessert since we were still a bit peckish:- Chocolate Souffle with Green Tea Ice Cream: I wasn't over the moon about this, but it was good. The souffle was very lava cake-ish, cooked on the outside and melty on the inside, with a dusting of matcha on top. The ice cream came out a bit melted. Both had solid and understated flavors.- Black Sesame Creme Brulee with (Black Sesame?) Ice Cream: The ice cream had a much more nutty flavor than the creme brulee. It had the perfect burnt-sugar top.Overall, you won't find cutting edge cuisine, but faithfully rendered Japanese izakaya food. Service here is very, very slow but always polite. We waited over 20 minutes to give our order, and then it was a solid 25+ min until we saw our first dish. It worked in our favor because we had wanted to catch up uninterrupted, but there were periods of up to an hour where we saw or spoke to no one. If you're trying to rush in and out, you'll be frustrated. We ended up spending nearly 3 hours there, though to be fair 30+ minutes were after we had paid.Bill ended up coming to about $60 each with tax and tip-- 2 dishes, a drink, and a dessert per person. Not unreasonable for Midtown or for the ambiance, but be prepared.There are a lot of Japanese places left to explore closer to me downtown and it didn't knock my socks off so I can't say that I'll be back immediately, but I have no regrets and hope that I find myself here in the future. The next time I'm craving sake, chawanmushi, and a tranquil atmosphere near Grand Central I'll head over.
Joseph S.}Hartsdale, NY}2}82}0}-1}5}6/6/2017Updatedreview}This is one of the best reasonably priced Japanese restaurants I have ever tried.  The only downside is that this place is almost always packed and it is hard to get a reservation.  Your best bet is to get there 15 to 30 minutes before they open and get one of their free tables that they set aside for walk ins.  The ambiance is great for business meals, drinks with friends or even romantic dinners.As one can imagine from their name, they have an impressive sake collection.  But in my opinion, their food is even more impressive.From expertly prepared sashimi to the best miso marinated cod fish in town, they offer some of the best Japanese seafood dishes around.  Lunch menu offers a variety of inexpensive tasty dishes that changes over time.Some of my other favorites?Ebi stick: A wonderful shrimp spring roll with an out of this world spicy and sweet dipping sauce.Black edamame:  If you haven't tried their black edamame, you have not eaten edamame.  Just go have some.Cold noodle with mushroom dipping sauce: Thin udon noodle of the gods with sauce from magical mushroom fairies.Warm udon noodles with yuzu shavings:  A delicate udon dish you won't find at most Udon places.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Fried chicken:  Perfectly fried morsels of dark chicken meat goodness that is the best fried chicken dish I have ever had.Sakagura also serves lunch on weekdays and I actually prefer their lunch offerings even better than their dinner items.  Their thoughtfully prepared lunch sets are to die for, including several "don" (or rice dishes) and noodle dishes.
P F.}Greenwich, CT}3}84}5}-1}5}6/6/2017}Thought I reviewed this one. Hidden gem. Not so much as it is crowded and not easy to get rsvns but do plan ahead as it is worth it. Nice nice of sushi and cooked options. Great sake selection. Excellent service. Kitschy fishing village decide but nice reprieve from ultra modernism in NYC. Great for dates or with friends. I have been several times and plan to go twice in the next 2 weeks!
Un L.}NY, NY}22}64}43}-1}4}6/3/2017}Can't believe it took me so long to find this place! Boy have I been missing out.  Too many great words to describe this place but I don't have the energy so I'll keep it simple.  I think this is what it would be like and taste like if I went to Japan.  Service was flawless, food was aaaaaamazing and sake... oh the sake! I'm salivating still thinking about the food and sake.  Can't wait to go back for some more!
Shelley W.}Jersey City, NJ}158}56}164}-1}4}6/3/2017}Be sure to allocate minimum 1.5 hours if you want to eat have a full meal here, and expect the food to take 15-50 minutes (depending on the dish) to come out, but I would say it is worth it.The restaurant is located in the basement of an office building, but tastefully decorated and has a comfortable/casual vibe. Cell phone signal is iffy, so expect to be offline here.As a party of two, we came on a Friday night on a 8:30 reservation (reserved two weeks beforehand). We ordered the pork belly, agedashi tofu, and a seasonal mixed rice bowl off the chefs special for two (oysters, mushrooms and wakame).Pork belly took 10 minutes to come out, agedashi took 35 minutes, and the rice bowl 50 minutes. My assumption is that all of these dishes were steamed/simmered for a very long time, since the tastes and marination and flavors of each were very...deep.Agedashi Tofu: very good. Surprisingly not as fried (which is good!). Skin very thin and crispy, but inside very soft. Sauce was good.Pork Belly: good. Flavoring on point, but in my opinion not that memorable.Mixed Rice Bowl: Picture-wise, not that appealing, but harmonious deep savory flavors. There were a lot of oysters. Without this dish, I definitely would have not been full since all the other tapas dish portions are pretty small.Overall, happy and decent meal.
Stuart M.}Weehawken, NJ}110}5}1}-1}5}5/31/2017}OMG.. What a find!! It's like a Japanese Speak Easy! Every dish mouthwatering and delicious! Definitely will be coming back.
Erik L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}93}28}-1}5}5/31/2017}One of my go-to places! Favorite is the kaarage, but really, everything is so good here. If you're looking for sushi, go somewhere else. This is Japanese cuisine, served in a speak easy style. It's a little hard to find, but that doesn't stop the crowds. Make a rez, or expect to wait a while.
W. L.}New York, NY}7}3}2}-1}2}5/31/2017}I'm pretty sure the cashier cursed me when I walked out....So, I went there for lunch every week whenever I can. Today I finally collected 10 stamps to get a free lunch special. Food is good as always.When I pick up the bill, since it's a free lunch, i was gonna leave a $5 tip. However, I didn't realize I don't have any cash on me. Even offered the guy next to me Venmo for cash. No luck, there is no signal down there. I asked the waiter if I can tip by card and explained. The waiter immediately showed his condescending face, saying "no, $10 minimum" and walked away. Yes, walked away. Then I asked for him again and he said talk to cashier. So fine, I did. And I gently asked if they have an ATM. Cashier wasn't happy either and instructed me to go to TD bank. Fine, I will go, my bad. Here is the catch, they asked me to leave an ID or credit card on hold, for a freaking tip, which should be discretionary but people tend to take it for granted. Holy cow, that's just messed up. I'm, well, I was a loyal regular and there is no way I should be treated like that. So, I got $20 cash, paid $3 ATM fee, they asked me if I want any change. Yes please, $19 back. And the guy said some nasty words in Japanese. Curse me however you want, sayonara, sakagura. I'm fed up with your attitude.
Torie W.}Queens, NY}205}228}519}18}5}5/28/2017}So many different types of sake with the bathrooms in a giant sale barrel! Feels like you've been transported back to Japan (and possibly a Japanese village)! Food is izakaya style with yakitori as well. The place is hard to find, located in the basement of a large office building. Food is great, though a bit pricey. Staff were very accommodating when I told them it was a birthday. Great place near grand central.
john r.}San Francisco, CA}0}104}0}-1}5}5/21/2017Updatedreview}Sakagura continues to be excellent. I eat there every time I come to NY. I appreciate it even more after my recent trip to Japan. The food is terrific - eggplant, eel, cod (& other fish dishes), black sesame creme brûlée- I wish I knew more about sake to pick from their extensive menu. The service is also very good, with just the right level of attentiveness. Overall, a great meal and authentic.
Alejandra G.}Cary, NC}175}10}6}-1}3}5/21/2017}I'm a big fan of tapas and Japanese food so this place seemed perfect for me, the impressive sake selection and the numerous meat options got me pumped for an evening here! We were sat 30 minutes after our reservation time and it took our server way too long to greet us initially.There were 4 of us and we ordered at least a dozen dishes, sake flight and glasses of sake. Sake was good, I was not impressed with the food however. Most of the plates were underwhelming especially for the price. They were good but not 26$ a small plate good. I was expecting much more flavor for that much. The highlight of the night was definitely the black sesame creme brûlée, definitely amazing and unique. I may return for sake flights and desert but it wasn't good enough for me to return for a full blown dinner.
Eunice H.}Los Angeles, CA}204}53}61}-1}5}5/15/2017}This meal and experience was EVERYTHING! Super authentic and traditional Japanese experience that exceeded our expectations! Located in the basement of an office building, it seems quite unassuming and simple. The inside is warm and friendly and you feel like you're being transported into another world! The service is top notch as the servers are super attentive and friendly. We ordered the five course lunch and a bento box. Every. Single. Thing we tried was amazing. The price point was amazing for the quality of food we received. The sashimi was so fresh and melted in our mouths. The tempura was one of the best I've had- the batter was extra light and crispy! Honestly one of the best Japanese dining experiences I've had the pleasure of partaking in! A MUST GO when you're in NYC!
Alli G.}Jersey City, NJ}7}23}13}-1}4}5/14/2017}Took my parents here with my boyfriend for Mother's Day. We got the sweet flight of sake, cold udon, the special fried fish, onigiri wrapped in mackerel, and the fried sardines. Not the cheapest place, but I'd go here again on a date night.  Food is superb, the price is why this gets 4 stars
Wanlu M.}New York, NY}1}17}12}-1}4}5/12/2017}I loved this place and went there multiple times. It is one of those go to places I would like to choose when eating out with friends.
Sean C.}Brooklyn, NY}95}471}22}18}4}5/12/2017}You wander down into a basement of an office building, brick walls that have been painted a few too many times, and enter into a attractive Japanese restaurant. It's a funny thing about New York, even an expensive Japanese restaurant has to think about rent affordability.But the food here was good, quite good. Our waiter was fantastic. I think our biggest hits were the beef tongue stew, Uni and egg, Tuna Tar Tar, the hot stone beef and a very yummy Gindara Yuan Yaki (steeped in soy sauce) that was very flaky. The Nuri Soba was delish, but no fault of the dish we over ordered and by the time that arrived eating felt like a chore.If you come here, the Sake is a must try. They have an excellent selection and are quite knowledgable about pairings. (at least I assume they are, honestly I know very little about sake)Great date spot, I think it'd be a bit unwieldy for groups.
Jenny W.}New York, NY}20}595}133}-1}4}5/11/2017}Very authentic but pricy spot. Didn't necessarily blow me away food wise, but everything was very solid. Standouts were the beef ishiyaki, Gyutan Yawakara Ni, Uzaku, Ginadara Yuan Yaki and Unisoba, and the seasonal dessert. The sake was amazing, and not to be missed.We tried a bunch of different things:Aburi Mentaiko (spicy cod roe) - This was interesting, a tad bit salty, but not overwhelmingly so. Pairs well with the sweet sake.Ika Shiokara (raw squid) - Knew that some people liked this, but other really disliked it, and I fall on the dislike camp. Too strong of a fishy taste.Gomoku Kinpira - Very good! Delicious veggies (esp. with the sesame oil), good way to start off the meal.Sashimi Moriawase - Came with uni, fatty tuna, and a couple of other fish that I can't remember. Only got to try a piece, and it was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps I'd feel differently if I had the fatty tuna.Hirame Ponzu - Really good raw fish, you know what you're getting. Fluke Carpaccio - Also really good. Honestly couldn't tell you the difference between this and the hirame ponzu, the two were very similar.Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago - This was a bit hard to share, and I ended up honestly not being that impressed. It's a cold soup, and while I love roe and uni and egg, putting them together didn't necessarily accentuate what I liked about each one of them. Uzaku - Really really good. The eel is super tender and I liked how it was paired with cucumbers and seaweed. Maguro Tartar - Pretty good tuna tartare, also very pretty / photogenic.Washu Beef Tataki - Wasn't super impressed by this, found the beef a bit hard to chew.Kamo Roast Negimaki - Definitely liked this more than the beef tataki. I'm a huge fan of duck, but this isn't my favorite preparation of duck. Good, but not outstanding. Tori Karaage - This was disappointing. Thought the chicken could have been more tender and the fried outside wasn't anything special.Nasu Dengaku - I really liked this, very tender grilled eggplant. Perhaps nothing mind blowing, but very good.Gindara Yuan Yaki (Black Cod) - Really good! I think we liked this even better than the version with Sea Bass (and it's cheaper). Super tender fish with a delicious sauce.Sea Bass (in sweet soy sauce?) - Also super super tender, so delicious. Buta Kakuni - Very good, soft and melt-in-your mouth tender, but at the end of the day, it's just pork belly. If you like pork belly, get it, otherwise, skip it, because it's not going to change your opinion of pork belly (aka it's good, but fatty).Chawanmushi - Some people at my table loved this, others found it disappointing. I fell in the meh camp - wasn't particularly impressed, but didn't dislike it. Yuba Shumai - Disappointed by this. Essentially a pork meatball wrapped in tofu skin, nothing unique or special about it. The pork wasn't super tender or flavorful.Gyutan Yawaraka Ni - One of my favorite dishes, but one that everyone else at my table barely touched. The beef tongue is super tender - tastes pretty much like tender beef - and the soup is crazy flavorful. Unisoba - Another standout dish, really good and savory soup, and just the right chewiness of the noodle. Steamed Rice with Oysters - They didn't have the crab version so we got this version. Skip it, at $40, one of the worst value items, and honestly didn't even taste that good (I prefer my oysters fresh rather than cooked with rice, since the oyster often ends up tasting a bit fishy).Grilled bamboo - One of the seasonal specials, was surprised to get a half shoot of bamboo with thick chunks cut out of it. Nothing special, I'd skip this.Beef Ishiyaki - SO GOOD. The beef was so tender, and you get to grill it over a hot stone in front of you. On the seasonal specials menu, but definitely not to be missed.We ended up trying almost all their desserts as well. Wasn't a fan of the sake manju, seemed to be an imbalance of the outer bun and the inner red bean, and was too cloying sweet. I really like the black sesame creme brulee, and the seasonal dessert, which was some flan of some sort (it kind of reminded of a mix between panna cotta and creme brulee, with a light sesame? flavor, super good). Tokyo Coffee Jell-o was okay, but missing that flavor oomph (but others in my group loved it). Sake Panna Cotta was also okay, definitely had a sake flavor, but not the consistency I love from panna cotta. Pear Mille-feuille was fine, nothing special, and the chocolate souffle was popular (but I'm not a huge fan of sweet chocolate desserts).Basically very solid renditions of Japanese food, nothing out of the box (the way you'd get at one of those modern twist on traditional cuisine restaurants), but good.
Yikai L.}New York, NY}95}335}525}-1}5}5/8/2017}Reserved a few weeks ago and it turns out so good! Everything is fresh and tasty - I like Buta Kakuni best, also vote for Unisoba and black sesame brûlée. Will definitely come for a second time. Too bad the moshi is sold out!
Ploy T.}Cleveland, OH}6}35}18}-1}3}5/8/2017}We think Sakagura is just OK. Not the best place for sushi or sashimi. The quality is good. Not super impressive. It is a little difficult to find the restaurant but not that hidden like some others like Bohemian. I think it is a little bit overprice
Ryan L.}Chapel Hill, NC}0}5}0}-1}5}5/6/2017}Amazing food and service - please try the onsen tamago, especially if you don't know what it is.
Rafael G.}Weehawken, NJ}4}49}30}-1}5}5/5/2017}What can I say? Excellent soba. The tempura is perfectly crisp. The desserts, especially the creme brûlée are top notch. Great atmosphere. Like you've found a hidden gem in someone's basement!
Ben W.}New York, NY}8}26}0}-1}5}5/4/2017}Been here many times. Small plates are excellent, as is the Sake. Not cheap, can be noisy and hard to get into, but a long time favorite.
Rea D.}Manhattan, NY}6}67}0}-1}5}5/4/2017}No, it's not cheap. But yes, it's worth it. Awesome space, awesome ambiance and incredible sake barrel shaped toilets. We've been here a few times on special occasions - the food is good and you should definitelyforsure order dessert here.
Kyna C.}New York, NY}32}122}24}-1}3}5/1/2017}The food is good but not great, especially at these price points. The atmosphere is weird and hard to feel comfortable. Waiters unhelpful. Try Yopparai in LES for an amazing izakaya.
Grace W.}Long Island City, New York, NY}0}84}47}-1}4}5/1/2017}It's hidden but it's not a secret! Great place to enjoy good Japanese food with an extensive sake selections. I've been here several times and always satisfied with their food to services. Hence, I will continue to dine here again and again.
Mark P.}Trempealeau, WI}48}7}0}-1}4}4/25/2017}Amazing place. A little hard to find.....its downstairs. Staff friendly and helpful. Food was fresh and delicious.
Chris Z.}New York, NY}36}68}213}-1}5}4/24/2017}We arrived on weekday around 7:15pm, no waiting line at this time~ Everything we tried here is sooo yummy! The perfect part of the grilled black cod is the collagen under the skin, the boiled beef tongue is so tender, the don with salmon and roe are perfect, the salmon is fresh and fatty, the roe is juicy, a perfect match! The black miso soup with clam is great too! Will definitely come back to check more dishes:)
A M.}Chantilly, VA}0}24}31}-1}3}4/19/2017}Meh! Had the assorted fish don ($21) - pretty average. The miso they served with it was luke warm and below average. My first time here based on other Yelp reviews and probably the last.
Renato N.}Manhattan, NY}7}61}44}-1}5}4/8/2017}Very traditional, hidden japanese spot - probably the best in the midtown east area. Ambience is great, although leaving the place without a very strong fish smell is impossible.Yes, it can be very pricy depending on what you order. They have an amazing selection of appertizers not usually found elsewhere, such as fermented beans. However, I would skip them all considering the portion sizes compared to the price.Instead, go with the sashimi moriwase - very fresh and thick. Also recommend the grilled cod and the duck slices.
Vicky L.}Brooklyn, NY}54}28}74}-1}3}4/7/2017}It's a cute place but extremely hard to find. I had to circle around the block 3 times before i realized it was in the basement of the building. I wish there was a bigger sign and more clear cut direction. Aside from that, the food wasnt bad but i didn't feel like it was anything extraordinary or different from any of the other Japanese restaurants out there. I was also pretty disappointed that they didn't have the snow crab pot rice that seems to be highly recommended in yelp. The waitress said that because they have another seasonal rice dish at moment, the snow crab one won't be available. One more thing is that this place is pretty tiny so not really good for big groups since the seating will get a bit uncomfortable. Otherwise everything else was pretty good.
Nicky T.}San Ramon, CA}77}89}349}-1}3}4/7/2017}Extremely pricy. Expensive was all that came to mind with my experience here.Food nothing exceptional for its illustrious cost. Service nothing out of the ordinary.Not the best choice for Japanese
Zhe C.}Columbia, MO}2}3}27}-1}4}4/5/2017}This place is quite hard to find. I don't know whether it's normal to have such places in NYC or not, it actually took me 30minutes to get there. The good thing is that this place opens till pretty late at night, which makes this place awesome for a late night hangout choice. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very causal and they do have many sake options to choose from.A great place overall, call them if you have difficulty finding this 'hidden' gem.
Nathan J.}Rancho Mirage, CA}177}68}10}-1}5}4/3/2017}As everyone else states, the path to get to the restaurant is sketchy for sure... but once you make it to the basement a literal Japanese village emerges! The prices are reasonable for the portions, our party of 6 selected around 12 dishes (some of which we doubled up on) which allows you to have a great selection of items. All were impressive and it was challenging to pick out a favorite. When the check came, I was pleasantly surprised because I would have easily expected it to be double the cost! We will definitely be returning to this unique gem.
Paul H.}Flatiron, Manhattan, NY}0}2}2}-1}5}4/1/2017}We wanted great sushi but got even greater Japan food and Sake. This restaurant was recommended for its Sake in a documentary on Sake on Netflix called Kampei. It was our 36th anniversary and we needed a great place to go after 10pm. Sakagura was perfect. We sat at the bar. Waiter was superb with food and Sake recommendations. We had a chef rice special with scallops which needed 40-50 mins. No problem as we had edename and sashimi carpaccio with our Sake. Love this place.
C O.}New York, NY}0}41}5}-1}5}4/1/2017}Cute little hidden spot in midtown east.  fun experience with friends and also with my husband on separate occasions.
R M.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}4}3/26/2017}I've visited Sakagura on three occasions and have been pleased with all my visits. The staff provides great service and is very accommodating. The food is great though I was charged a surcharge for condiments (ginger). The location is fun and sake selection very nice. I definitely recommend Sakagura.
Charles L.}Rochester, NY}3}112}1}-1}4}3/26/2017}Excellent sushiI ate here on a weekday night very late. The service was excellent. The food was  excellent. I had miso soup, grilled eggplant with three kinds of miso, and then chefs choice of five kinds of sashimi. All fresh and delicious. Excellent night !
Victoria W.}North Babylon, NY}89}11}2}-1}5}3/25/2017}This place was phenomenal. Amazing authentic Japanese restaurant known for its sake bar. Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite was the hot stone steak. It literally melts in your mouth. If your looking for a foodgasm this is the place to go. The service was impeccable. The server suggested the best cold sake I've ever had. The ambience was perfect, felt as though we were really in Japan! Highly recommend this restaurant and definitely returning!
Silvino P.}Manhattan, NY}365}121}732}18}4}3/22/2017}Sakagura is actually one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to in New York and closely resembles that of a classy restaurant in Japan. The staff is really nice and accommodating and the service I would say is 5 stars as well. Took away a star only because the desserts are so pricey and really small. My lunch dish(oyako don) was $12.50 compared to my dessert(black sesame brûlée) was $14.00. All in all the food was better than good but not great and the service was also good. Lunch is really popular here among the East side white collar business men as well as tourist but this place is a bit hard to find but it's located on the left when u walk in down the stairs towards the basement
Mugendd P.}Toronto, Canada}3}69}191}-1}4}3/18/2017}Tried this Japanese place from a reco from a friend.  Be sure to make reservation for lunch as its a busy place for locals.  The location is interesting little hard to find because its in the basement of an office building,  Found out this was a soba place and at lunch a lot of people were having either the cold or hot soba lunch special so that's what we got, it comes with salad and miso soup, the soba comes with a bowl of rice with chopped up raw fish. The staff and service was great would definitely try this place again.
Mar R.}Manhattan, NY}0}41}3}-1}4}3/16/2017}Good Japanese tapas. A vegetarian will have no trouble here. Eggplant boats were delicious. Sushi is good. Restaurant is quite expensive but be adventurous and you'll have fun.
Claudine V.}Oakland, CA}1885}1303}835}18}3}3/6/2017}I came here for my last night in NY.  This place is literally located in the basement of this white well light up bldg. So go all the way in to the white bldg and hang left and go downstairs two flights and then you will see the door. We made reservations so we were seated immediately.  Everything is tapas style so we shared all dishes. We ordered the following :1) red snapper collar- special for the night2) beef tongue-delish!3) rib eye beef4) chicken karaage5) pork karaage6) black cod7) daikon salad 8) grilled squid. Everything was good but I must say I have had better in SF. The best course for me was the beef tongue and the pork karaage. The beef tongue was super tender and served with this thick very flavorful broth. The pork karaage was very well flavored and super crispy.  It was good to try and compare this place with the Kokko and Kiraku and compare east and west. I still vote WEST.
Yy Z.}Melbourne, Australia}0}22}0}-1}5}3/5/2017}Great memory, a best of NYC trip. Came at a late night, no faults on any dishes. Definitely will visit again next time!
Merlin C.}Manhattan, NY}232}530}47}18}4}3/5/2017}An awesome restaurant located in the basement of an office building, Sakagura lives up to a lot of the word-of-mouth hype. There is a speakeasy-ish feel to the decoration, which I found creative. I'm usually alarmed by over-the-top decor, as it's almost always passed on to the consumer in hiked prices, but this really added a nice element. Maybe I'm becoming old and soft on a once major pillar of my reviewing rubric?!?!I don't drink, so I have no idea about the apparently encyclopedic sake menu, but my fellow diners seemed really into it. (I just had a Ginger Ale.) Most of the stuff here, except for the sashimi platters, comes in small plates. I highly recommend the cod, the sashimi, and the salmon or tuna tartar, both of which were transcendent. I also loved the pork belly. Not a single thing was bad, though it will take a lot of ordering to make you full.I do think they could work on their dessert game and have some non-Japanese deserts. Mochi ice cream has always tasted to me like a bad frozen fig newton. Or does this make me a parochial American?!
Steven G.}New York, NY}99}56}4}-1}4}3/3/2017}Had a fun experience at this little hole in the wall, actually, basement. Now entering the location is a little weird, because you're going to enter an office building and walk straight down into some steps. You'll be transported from corporate America into a hidden Japanese gem.The size caught me by surprise, it's much bigger than I expected. A little tricky to walk around as everything is so close, and wait staff is constantly running around the narrow space. The restaurant could've used a little more light too, but I understand it's in a basement. Extra points for the adorable bathrooms.Now on to the food. I celebrating a friend's birthday here, we had a big party and after a few bottles of sake, it was just all sorts of fun! This is a Japanese tapas style restaurant, so 2-3 plates should be ideal. I ordered the Ribeye Toban Steak & Buta Kakuni. The ribeye toban was alright, nothing to write home about. The Buta Kakuni is Sakagura's signature dish, and it was the highlight of my party's night. Everyone wanted a piece, it was truly delicious! The food in general is pretty good, but the portions are out of control. Some plates were really small, meant for one person, while others were meant for six people.Price is leaning on the expensive side, I feel like that's the case with most Japanese restaurants. It was a good time with great food & drinks. I would definitely repeat again, but a good tip to know is reserve a table on opentable. It seems to be pretty popular, and you could be stuck waiting for a long time.
Hit U.}New York, NY}1}785}0}-1}5}2/27/2017}Absolute perfection!! Every dish we ordered was excellent and the drink selection was impressive. Sake was great, had the Aburi Mentaiko which I highly recommend along with the Chawanmushi. I definitely plan on returning. Food is very delicious!!
Mayumi B.}Lake Mary, Orlando, FL}16}78}311}18}5}2/25/2017}If you like Sake you must try this place!  I am from Japan and I felt like I was in Japan!  So many variety of Sake and food is super good!!! If I live in NYC this would be my date spot!!! I can't wait to go back there!
Donnie Y.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}3}2/25/2017}Besides the prices, everything is amazing. Food quality, vibe, service, etc. Who'da thought such an awesome place could be found in the basement of an office building next to Grand Central? Only complaint: there is no value here. $8 for a tiny slice of tofu. $17 for a small bowl of noodles with one piece of each vegetable in it. Don't come here if you're hungry since you'll need to spend $150 to leave full. Recommendation: grab a slice of pizza down the street first, then come here to tingly your tastebuds.
Johnathan T.}Elmhurst, Queens, NY}95}38}1}-1}5}2/15/2017}What a hole in the wall this is.Literally ! well more like in the basement.Food is great service was great. Might need a little more light but then AGAIN you are in a basement.
Cynthia Z.}Manhattan, NY}89}101}583}18}2}2/12/2017}Came here to celebrate Valentine's Day early and BOY was I disappointed.. We arrived around 7:50pm and was told there's a 10-15 minute wait, which wasn't bad. After we got seated we placed our orders, Maguro Tartar ($16), Miyazaki Beef Ishiyaki ($38), Sea Urchin Unisoba ($22) and the Salmon Chirashi ($26). The Miyazaki Beef Ishiyaki came out first and you cook the beef on top of a hot stone which was unique. It came with a side of salt, soy sauce and wasabi. The beef was so juicy and tender. The salt complimented the beef so well. Shortly after came the Maguro Tartar. The Tartar was bland and average, I've had better. Half way into our appetizers the waitress came and told us they were sold out of ALL the soba dishes and we had such a hard time picking another dish. So we ended up going with the Hot "inaniwa" udon ($13.50). After we finished both appetizers, we waited about 45 minutes and had to ask our waitress to check on our remaining 2 dishes. Finally the Hot "inaniwa" udon came out and can i just say WHAT THE HELL.. it was just a small basic, plain noodle soup.. For $13.50 !! definitely not worth it at ALL ! 15 minutes after receiving the Hot "inaniwa" udon the waitress comes back and told us that there was some "technical difficulties" with our second dish, the Salmon Chirashi and that she does not know how long it will take. By then it was almost 10pm, we were still hungry and tired of the waiting, we just wanted to get the bill and leave.. So we had a total of 3 dishes and out of the 3 dishes, we only liked 1 (Miyazaki Beef ishiyaki). I won't be returning to Sakagura.
Yihao O.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}0}62}3}-1}4}2/10/2017}Was there with a couple coworkers on Tuesday night I think. This place is always packed so we were just happy we made it wo rsvp or less by wait. The London guy was not a big drinker so we didn't get to drink much. Monk fish livers, chirashi, and uni over cold soba left me with the best impressions. Will try to go back again.
Urinka H.}New York, NY}115}62}58}18}4}2/8/2017}Reminded me of a bit high ended izayaka(tapas) in Japan! Ordered broiled pork, stewed beef, pickles, soba noodle with sea urchin, deep fried chicken, and gelato. It is Japanese portion so you need to enjoy every bite of it! Soba sea urchin on the top was distinctive - the soup was umeboshi plum based. Sake I had ( cannot recall the name) was nice and dry. You just have to ask the waiter how you like it. ( I told him that I like the one that is dry and not sweet at all, and it was exactly the one I wanted)
Raffles T.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}70}16}22}-1}5}2/7/2017}Really nice environment and food was so pretty and high quality. The waitress give us very good advice on ordering food. Will come here again!
Alexandra F.}Merrick, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}2/6/2017}This place seems tucked away and secretive, but once you're inside you'll notice it is very popular! There are so many options on the menu and everything is so fresh. I frequent here for lunch have always enjoyed my meal. Service is okay, but I associate it with how busy the restaurant is. Servers aren't frequent to your table, but will not forget to make sure you ahve everything you need. Overall great food and awesome lunch options.
Massimo P.}New York, NY}38}326}10}-1}4}2/4/2017}Very good authentic Japanese. You won't even find sushi here, which is far less important to Japanese cuisine than we are usually led to believe. (They do have sashimi and chirashi, though.) They are known for their bewildering variety of sake. If you don't know much about it, ask your waiter and go for one of the tasting flights. Dishes are small, so you'll need 3-4 for a good dinner, or more to share if in a group. The only thing I didn't really care for was their panna cotta dessert. But the Japanese whisky I ordered more than made up for it. Not cheap, but not outrageous either. Worth the experience.
Nat D.}Edgewater, NJ}0}13}0}-1}5}2/2/2017}A GEM in midtown Manhattan.  You would never know it was there if you weren't looking for it.  The sake selection is unparalleled in terms of quantity.  The staff is very friendly.  The atmosphere is traditional and fun.  The food is excellent.  Love the tamago and the wagyu dishes.
Chris S.}Bloomington, IL}0}10}9}-1}4}1/28/2017}Visited for a birthday dinner. However we were disappointed that we couldn't celebrate with the cake we brought, not even with a fee. Radish salad was very fresh and great texture. Sashimi was good and fresh, although the selection was limited. Grilled eggplant and yaki onigiri were excellent. Their signature braised pork belly was over rated. Price were reasonable except the small portion draft beer.
Chanli S.}San Francisco, CA}2}98}1}-1}3}1/27/2017}Overrated. The beef on hot stone and pork belly was good. The miso soup was just off. The pickled vegetable was off too. The sashimi was fresh. Service was average. Could barely understand them. They do spend the time to plate everything, including arranging flowers to the sake. Extensive sake selection.
Richard K.}Brooklyn, NY}0}138}0}-1}5}1/22/2017}Great spot. You enter through a sparse white building lobby and go down to the basement - it kind of feels like Tokyo in that sense. The restaurant is tastefully decorated - lots of wood, lots of sake bottles on the wall, a long bar. The menu is super interesting, tons of Japanese dishes you don't usually see in your standard spots. Some favorites include omelette/eel, chicken meatballs. They also have some great sashimi.
Tika D.}New York, NY}91}39}7}-1}4}1/20/2017}The food is so delicious. We ordered the salmon, chicken, spring roll.But, the waitresses are not that friendly. Probably because it was a busy time. We got to wait for awhile for our water to be refilled. And they only refilled it once even if the glasses have been empty for awhile. We actually had to request for the refill.
MK M.}New York, NY}0}138}2}-1}2}1/18/2017}Didn't actually eat here because we got turned off by the Letter B artfully hidden so that people don't see that they didn't get an A from the health department. This restaurant should really be an A cleanliness establishment.
Thomas K.}Queens, NY}55}30}6}-1}4}1/16/2017}Recently went in again for lunch (4th time in 6 months) and again had the Sakagura lunch tasting course and I've got to say that each time, the cod is my favorite. And for those who know me, I don't really like cooked fish but they definitely do it right. It's just the right amount of sake with soy and cooked to perfection.I've also been here for dinner as well. It's more of a tapas style so I recommend ordering a few different items to share.It's in a very unassuming office building's basement but definitely recommend it.
Jiahui W.}Madison, WI}116}5}20}-1}5}1/13/2017}I order black cod in every Japanese restaurant I visited, and the black cod here is one of my favorite with no doubt. It's fresh, definitely, so the cod was naturally separated into pieces like flower with one bite. And more importantly, the cod has stronger sake flavor than the sweet soy source. It shows the dedication when chief marinated the cod, since most of the Japanese restaurants rely on the sweet soy source to add the flavor but not the sake. It smells so good and the sake scent together with the code taste just bombed in my mouth. And as a urchin lover, the urchin soba I have today is so great. The urchin is so fresh, and it's sweet. You can see how confident the chief is, from the urchin soup served with the soba. The tonburi on top is a surprise, with a flavor like less juicy but crispy caviar, balanced the strong flavor of urchin. For a restaurant like Sakagura, the fresh wasabi is not a compliment but a must-have. But I like the way how they scrap it. The wasabi mash has large wasabi particles mingled,  which surprises me when I have it with the soba. The earl grey tea ice cream is not so sweet, the creamy tea flavor is really enjoyable. Overall, this is one of the best Izakaya in the town. Don't let the office building scare you, just come in. I will be back to have more for sure.
Isabel H.}New York, NY}346}22}6}-1}4}1/13/2017}Great place if you want authentic Japanese. Don't come here for sushi unless you want to leave paying $$$ -- they're known more for their Japanese-styled small plates. I came on a date and we ordered the radish salad, which was a generous size and quite delicious. We also ordered the maguro yamakake- v interesting. I'm not a huge fan, but thought we should try it. Also got the karage, which basically is Japanese-styled fried chicken. How can you go wrong? Then we ordered the beef in a teriyaki glaze which now I can't remember the name of. That was quite flavorful and generous in portion size as well. These small plates are relatively pricey, but great if you order a variety then split.
Jay F.}Manhattan, NY}0}21}4}-1}5}1/13/2017}Easy to miss spot, but could be the best soba in the city.  Next door to Soba Totto, its much more visible neighbor which also serves excellent soba, this basement location is like going back to Tokyo.  Had the soba tempura, and both the noodles and the tempura rival anything in town.  They also have an extensive and tasty sake menu. Highly recommended.
Jenn X.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}0}2}0}-1}1}1/12/2017}The food was ok but the service was bad. We celebrated one of our friends' birthday here. When we finished, someone cleaned up the table for us. And I told him that we brought the cake. He said he would have someone help us. Then the waitress came and told us that we could not cut the cake here and not even light the candles, because that's the rule. So we just requested the bill but it took so long to have our bill ready. While we were waiting, we just opened the cake and started taking pictures. The waitress reminded us that we could not have outside food here. I told her that we were just taking pictures. Then one minute later, another lady, I'm not sure if she's the cashier or the manger, came over and said "you guys cannot do that here". She was kind of rude and she did it say it in a proper manner. I was mad and I said we were just taking pictures. She was like, taking pictures is find but no outside food. I said we are not gonna eat it here. She was like, oh please, don't eat it here. Sigh, smh. It was such a bad experience. Never come back again!!!
Johanna T.}New York, NY}443}206}23}18}5}1/10/2017}I had been wanting to come here for a while, so when I finally had the chance, I ordered everything on the menu I thought I might like. Needless to say, we were stuffed by the end of that dinner but oh so happy. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted phenomenal, down to the hot sake. I honestly think Sakagura could do no wrong...at least from what I've experienced so far. If you can snag a reservation, do not pass it up.
May C.}Queens, NY}70}73}131}18}5}1/9/2017}I wish this place was easier to get reservations for. I love their pork belly, miso eggplant, salmon rice, spinach, and black sesame creme brule. Too bad I don't drink because their sake menu is extensive.
Amy C.}Oakland Gardens, NY}26}41}0}-1}3}1/9/2017}This review is describing my second time (Sunday, January 8, 2017) at Sakagura. I treated my best friend from California to dinner.We were extremely happy that we were able to get a table in five minutes, but things (or rather, food) went salty from there.We were extremely disappointed how most of our foods were over-seasoned with salt (two orders of black cod, ebi sticks, pork belly, grilled squid, beef sashimi, and fried veggie dish). Thinking back on our first time at Sakagura, my boyfriend and I wondered if they changed chefs during the whole meal. I did not want to make a fuss about it to the staff that night, but I hope this issue gets resolved.
Aaron S.}New York, NY}47}52}7}-1}4}1/7/2017}This is one of those places best to come with another couple and just order a whole bunch of stuff off the menu. Everything we tried was really good, my favorite was the GRILLED BLACK COD. It literally melts in your mouth!!
Jennifer B.}Brooklyn, NY}78}13}2}-1}5}1/5/2017}What a magical Japanese oasis in the middle of Midtown East! I've worked a block away the past four years and never knew this place existed! Hidden in the basement of a modern office building, this place radiates warmth, intimacy, authenticity and damn good service & food! You won't be disappointed.
Cristina X.}New York, NY}411}444}3428}18}4}12/26/2016}Sakagura is 3.5 stars on my scale. I love their extensive sake selections from the premium daiginjo to the more down-to-the-earth junmai sakes, but would slightly prefer Ise Restaurant for better sushi/sashimi or Izakaya for the hearty Japanese bar food. Bar seats are my favorite because I always learn new stuff about sake from the knowledgeable bartenders. Although hidden in the basement of the United Nations Building, this place is usually packed for dinner. Book a reservation online if you plan to visit during busy hours.The service was slow that we had to wait over 30 minutes for our main dish--udon soup. I was not adventurous enough to enjoy the Santen-mori (we got ABURI MENTAIKO (Spicy Cod Fish Roe Lightly Broiled (*), IKA SHIOKARA (Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salty Squid Liver Marinade (*), and AMAEBI SHUTOUAE (Chopped Raw Sweet Shrimp cured in Sake and Bonito Liver Marinade)). All of them are very salty and heavy that I could not enjoy. Other dishes were delightful tho:Chawamushi (Steam Egg with mushroom, gingko, chicken, and seafood in chicken broth with light vinegar in it): the egg is smooth as silk, the dish is very fresh and flavorful. I recommend this dish if you dont mind the light sourness in the soup.The signature Ishiyaki (thinly sliced beef self-cooked on top of a hot stone see my pic). It is a fun dish o share as you  Inaniwa Udon in a hot clear broth. Refreshing and simple with only udon, scallions, and spinach. Ideal spot to bring your Sake lover friends! they also host special tasting events/offer seasonal sakes!
Daiji I.}Hunters Point, Queens, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}12/21/2016}We went to Sakagura for dinner. I had a concern that our party was ten, however, every meal was great and our server Mr. Soma was very attentive and flexible so that we could enjoy very much.Thank you very much!
Dion C.}Manhattan, NY}0}72}0}-1}5}12/20/2016}Great hidden izakaya in midtown east. Cool ambience, and a large selection of unique dishes.
Scarlet W.}Los Angeles, CA}166}41}55}-1}5}12/16/2016}Overall: One of the best izakaya choices in NYCThe food here is delicious, and I especially love their soba options. Apparently there's a deal right now where you can preorder takeout soba meals for 2 people. Sounds interesting!I've been here for excellent lunch and dinner meals, but I prefer their lunch specials---they are fantastic value and quite filling! This time around though, I came for dinner. I've discovered that dashi chazuke is one of my favorite dishes. It's extremely simple---just rice with tea-infused bonito broth poured over it---but I love it as Japanese comfort food on a cold, polar vortexy kind of day. The hirame ponzu (fluke sashimi) was also very tasty. In comparison to other izakayas in NYC, Sakagura has a very nice atmosphere. I was surprised at how busy it was on a Thursday night at 9:30pm. Make sure to make reservations in advance! If it's your first time here, walk into the building past the receptionist and take a left to go downstairs to the restaurant.
Tina T.}New York, NY}429}63}29}-1}5}12/11/2016}Loved it here! Loved the decorations, our sake was good, everything we ordered was amazing and our waiter was super attentive.Made plans to come here one weekend and totally forgot it didn't open until 6, so remember to check the hours before you go or you'll end up like me....wondering if it was so hidden they turned the lights off LOL. But walking in there really felt like going back to Japan! My boyfriend and I went to a similar place in Osaka and we've been trying to find a place in the city that reminds us of it.We went with our Japanese roommate and it was a good time, drinks were flowing and the food was on point. I would recommend the dishes that they have highlighted in red in the menu- they were really. Everything is definitely on the pricier side, but it's totally worth it.  I was expecting more of a loud izakaya kinda vibe but it's actually very calm(?) there...it feels more like a mix between cozy intimate dinner and  fine dining rather a loud animated place.
Ann S.}Brooklyn, NY}48}174}364}18}5}12/11/2016}I was brought here by a friend who heard really good things about the food and dessert served at Sakagura. It truly is an authentic Japanese restaurant, and as good as the ones in Japan. Came during lunch time and even though we came when the restaurant just opened, the tables were filled right away.  I ordered cold sea urchin soba and my friend order the daily special which was the Barachirashi don (different raw fish and squash over rice) which also came with soba. There is a limit to the specials that they serve for the day, for the sea urchin soba the limit was 7. So it's a good idea to go early. The daily special sets are different every day of the week.  We also order the tempura, a mix between shrimp and vegetables. My favorite had to be the tempura; it was fried to a perfect crisp on the outside without being too oily and inside it was al dente. It really was as good as tempura in Japan. The cold sea urchin noodle was also really good, golden taste of the uni went well with the cold soba. The entire meal was light and delicious. Being the dessert junkie that I am , we ordered the black sesame crème brulee and the mocha. I prefer the black sesame crème brulee, it was creamy, full of sesame flavor without being too sweet. The mocha comes in three flavors, orange chocolate, matcha and sesame and comes with matcha ice cream. Within your first bite you can tell that the mochi was homemade. I also love the décor of the restaurant, especially the bathroom, super cute.
Carol F.}Richmond, VA}553}227}395}18}5}12/2/2016}Easily the best and most memorable meals I have had and probably will have for a while. You are in for an amazing experience!The restaurant is larger than you would imagine for being tucked away in a basement. There is a mysterious air about it as you traverse what I believe is a hotel for access to the restaurant entrance. Somehow this makes this place, which is obviously not a secret with its 1400+ reviews, seem like a hidden gem.First: make sure to use their restroom. They're equipped with the Japanese toilet seats :) I don't think you'll find them too often here besides in Japan/Asia. You don't have to use all its wacky functions but it's fun to have those options :)ANYWAYS. I love that it has late night hours on Fridays, so you can fully finish your day's activities and not have to rush to get here to eat. We arrived around 9:30 and there was no wait for a table for 2.The decor is beautiful and so Japanese. I noticed a cute little teeny tiny tea set at the front register as I walked in. The miniature food type that can fit on your pinky finger. They love that! As we explored the menu, there were so many things to try and we didn't know what to pick. So we asked our server if he could pick for us. He simply said, "yes", and took our menus. More mystery...We chose to get a half bottle of cold sake to share, which was served in a wooden case with ice and a side of freshly picked flowers. It was a beautiful presentation for a simple thing (see pictures). How spoiled we felt already..You might be thinking, uh oh, the server will obviously pick the most expensive things on the menu for you, since you set yourself up for that! Nope, he picked menu items that were exactly to our tastes, a mixture of meats, seafoods, and vegetables in appetizers and entrees, of mixed high and low prices. He asked if we were still hungry before he brought out another dish. Many dishes seemed like unique staples of this restaurant, as it implies from the Yelp pictures, so I was glad I got to try their must-gets. All the food was spectacular. Delicious, cooked wonderfully, everything was such a treat. The service was amazing, living up to the Japanese reputation of perfect hospitality. If I were to make recommendations, they would be: - maguro tartar appetizer- uni soba noodles- black sesame creme bruleeSo this was probably as close to a perfect meal as I've experienced yet. If you want a special night out, definitely try this place!
Morgan D.}Erie, PA}76}9}5}-1}5}11/25/2016}Gorgeous interior; below ground but felt like an open air lounge. Interesting menu, unfortunately light on vegetarian options (fine if you eat fish). Good tasting menu, would recommend for the ambiance to anybody. Make sure to reserve.
Vicky T.}Durham, NC}697}379}782}18}4}11/25/2016}I very romantic setting for a date night. Definitely on the expensive side and you must order a lot of small dishes to fill you up, however it's worth the experience! The food are very uniquely made
Stephanie L.}Manhattan, NY}290}66}25}18}4}11/21/2016}I've read multiple reviews use the word "gem" to describe Sakagura. I couldn't agree more. Hidden in the basement of an office building, Sakagura is a little difficult to find.  The interior is traditionally Japanese: with cozy, wooden booths and a beautiful bar.  The food is tapas style, and the menu has a wide variety of dishes.  My favorite was the uni soba. There quite a bit of uni and it added a delicate creaminess to the chilled buckwheat noodles.  The cool, miso broth added a slight nutty element that complemented quite well with the uni and noodles.  Service was excellent.  Our server was very attentive and quick.  He continually checked in on us without being intrusive. One thing I wanted to highlight that I found great was the extensive sake selection.  Sakagura offers various options, include sake flights.  I love that they chill the sake bottles in little  ice tubs decorated with fresh beautiful flora, ikebana style. Overall, great find!
Tunaidi A.}Manhattan, NY}479}1332}10}18}4}11/21/2016}Sakagura is a pretty decent Japanese tapas place. The setting inside is pretty Japanese and not pretentious, with a long bar against one side, cozy booths against the other, and other seating organized in between. Love the variety here. Some choices are great hits, while others are not so much. I'd say the pork belly and uni soba are winners, and the desserts are amazing. Service is also really attentive.
Soraya L.}Madison, WI}93}15}13}-1}5}11/16/2016}This is one of the few restaurants I have been to that I don't mind spending all my paycheck on at all. Food: Unpretentious. The ingredients are fresh and they don't use a lot of fancy seasonings to mask the quality of their seafood and produce. Favorite was the steamed crab rice in Clay pot. Wanted to try the limited uni soba and made reservation for the first available table. Unfortunately, they did not have much uni that day so they didn't put it on the daily menu. The 3 of us ordered 50% of the menu. Even after we are stuffed, we decided to try the desserts as well. So full and so happy Service: I dripped a few drops of soy sauce on the table and a server immediately came to wipe it. Best service I have had in awhile. The servers were genuinely interested in making your dining experience worthwhile. Overall, will come again.And again. And again!
Jainnielyn C.}Queens, NY}108}156}499}18}4}11/11/2016}Great value lunch sets!Being a lover of sashimi, the jewel oke bento ($20) was perfect for me! Various sashimi, veg tempura, a couple of appetizers and rice balls. Yum! I love this as there's different flavors and textures complimenting the fresh raw fish. They only make 20 of these everyday, so go early (12 noon) if you want to catch one!Service was excellent and courteous. The ambience is intimate and interesting with the sake bottles lined up on the shelves. There is an indoor tree (real or fake?) which makes for a unique experience. Not just an affordable lunch spot!
Cathleen L.}Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY}46}14}858}-1}3}11/9/2016}Came here for a weekday lunch with friends. I ordered Oyako Donburi, the chicken and egg on rice bowl, expecting to have something comforting, warm and simple, yet it came lukewarm and the eggwhite is still in fluid. The taste is good though. My friends liked their udon and the servers are very friendly.
Marina S.}Brooklyn, NY}341}318}780}18}5}11/7/2016}Sakagura isn't exactly a secret in New York City, but it always feels like it whenever I have the opportunity to visit. You enter through a nondescript office building in midtown, walk through a sterile lobby, and step down some ominous stairs to the basement to find an upscale izakaya transformed for each of the seasons. It's beautiful, intimate, and absolutely perfect for impressing that special someone or entertaining guests from out of town.(If you need further proof on the point above, I once went on a first date to Sakagura and he was 45 minutes late. Any right minded person should have left, but I waited and was blown away by dinner. We're also still dating, so he wasn't too bad either. Thanks Sakagura!)If you're an avid sake drinker, you'll love their huge selection, particularly their sake flights which include detailed cards on what exactly you're drinking. I'm less enthusiastic about sake, but they have a few great sake cocktails and a selection of plum wines as well.As for the food, if you're only drinking at Sakagura, you need to reevaluate your life choices. You'll find less of the deep-fried oil bombs you usually find at izakayas and more upscale Japanese food, from seaweed salad to sashimi with mountain yam (But don't order anything with mountain yam. Just trust me on this one; I learned the hard way). Everything I've ordered has always been delicious, and is served in small plates so you can sample away.No matter how full you are, you MUST order dessert as well. Their ice creams are all incredible, and the perfect compliment to all of their sweets. I personally love the black sesame creme brûlée; it's an innovative take on the French classic and one of my favorite desserts in NYC.Where Sakagura really stands apart from other upscale izakayas is their attention to detail in EVERYTHING. You'll notice fresh, seasonal flowers, beautiful plating, and attentive service from the waiters. They also have Japanese toilets (LOVE) and business cards on where to buy said Japanese toilets, so that gets an extra star from me.It's pricier than your average izakaya, but that's definitely reflected in the quality of food, drink, and service that you receive here. This may not be the best place to bring 15 of your closest drinking buddies, but for a special night out, Sakagura is a great choice. I've only been a handful of times, but I'm already looking forward to my next trip!
Delphi L.}New York, NY}20}73}1325}-1}5}11/6/2016}My memory of this place was the hundreds of tiny paper cranes of different colors (the ones you fold to make wishes, send to boys or save in a glass jar), hung from the ceiling, blowing like wind chimes. It's one year's decoration, and it's many years ago.. We, oh rather I ordered a lot. Every dish was a treat. I especially enjoyed the chawanmushi which was very sour because of the plum sauce. Mom told me when I was a kid, who gets the green bean and the shrimp would have the best luck. I dug out the bean, and my company spoiled me with the shrimp. So.. all the good is to come. ;)The simmered sea bream (which requires 20-30 prep time) had the perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness. Probably because it took time to simmer, the sauce was absorbed so completely and the fish meat was tender and juicy. It puzzled me first which flavor to seek, but then a sense of happiness suddenly popped in with the sweet aftertaste, and stayed on. Had the red bean manju and black sesame soufflé for deserts. I poked the kanji, this time sakagura, on the manju skin as usual. I like to break perfect things because they don't last, but the fun stopped there- my parents used to be annoyed because I always left the rest 2/3 untouched. My friend said black sesame helps grow your hairs black. But then I was thinking that eating carrots makes you orange. If that applies, hoho...
Thalie L.}Chicago, IL}90}295}310}18}4}11/2/2016}I tried Sakagura for the first time on last Friday - Special Lunch with my boss. recommended by a colleague. We usually book very very fancy places but this time it was a sort of Japanese speakeasy. My boss loved it. It is located in the basement of an office building. The decoration is pretty cool and the food is amazing. we both got the sushi bowl with the Udon soup.The only thing that I regret is the service was a little bit slow with our table due to the busy time. A good address of the Midtown area!
E K.}Hoboken, NJ}0}5}0}-1}4}11/2/2016}Great lunch special. Was able to try the one of 7 servings of the uni lunch special, which was delicious. Definitely planning to try more. The atmosphere/decor was unique to the usual lunchtime choices.
Go B.}Westwood, CA}52}246}7971}-1}5}10/29/2016}Highly recommend this place for Japanese cuisine.Marking this place as one of my favorites (& best  izakaya) in NYC.Beautiful interior (feels like you're in Tokyo).Extensive/reasonably priced menu. Nice list of many different types of sake.Highlight dishes:  Atsuyaki tamago, roasted duck/scallion, tori karaage. miyazaki beef ishiyaki, shimesaba aburi (roasted mackerel), salmon (collar) kama shioyaki, and the deep-fried golden eye sea bream w/ stir-fried scallions.The desserts (black sesame brûlée & ice cream quatro) were great, as well.Excellent service (Many thanks to Takuya.)Highly recommend.: 9 calendars
Grim}Miami, FL}0}4}0}-1}1}10/27/2016}It is hard not to give a one star after reading so many splendid comments on yelp. Especially when the uni in the sashimi platter was rancid and bitter. That was just a nail to the coffin.The food is Americanized in some way. Even though the dishes were still Japanese, the seasoning of the dishes have been tailored to American taste. If you truly want real Japanese taste. I would suggest look at other restaurants. But if you enjoy modified Japanese food, I suppose they provide that.Uni egg soup sounded great but reality was the opposite. It has a lot to do with the quality of their uni. Moreover, the whole thing feels like a random put-together instead of a thought-out dish. Uni, poached egg, and the dashi are so separated. [Much better off to go get some fresh uni from chelsea market and add a poached egg to that]Service was not as attentive as well. So the first thing they tell you after you sit down is everything is small portion and for sharing. When the soup and the rice dish came out, we were not provided with any smaller bowls OR EVEN SPOONS. [At least teach us how to enjoy soup with chopsticks before running off to other tables]
Qiaoyi X.}Manhattan, NY}96}149}256}18}5}10/22/2016}CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE!! A big booklet of sake, and imported wasabi! How bad could it be.I went there at a Friday night. Because I was alone, I was seated within 15 minutes. The menu is more of izakaya (small plate) style. AMAEBI SHUTOUAE: Raw shrimp with Bonito Liver Marinade. The shrimp is very very live and fresh. Well, the marinade is too salty to me. I had a hard time to finish it.Takowasabi: octopus ink, raw octopus and wasabi. I don't know about the black ink, but the real bomb is the wasabi. It has a strong kick after five seconds, which means it's fresher than normal packaged one. I did ask, and find out it's imported from Japan. The octopus is quite chewy. I wish it's softer.DASHI CHAZUKE: Rice with tea and a topping, in my case, plum. This the most authentic Chazuke I've ever had. They poured tea over the rice in front of me. Even the person next to me envied this experience. :D With seaweed and a nice tea, It felt so right when you just want something to finish your dinner.CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: Highlight of the night. Favorite  dish so far. Fresh from oven. Chocolate melt in my mouth every single bite. Even the green tea ice cream is in a authentic way without too much sugar. The dish was devoured quickly.I would definitely come again for the chocolate souffle and try some other sake.
Ben S.}Trumbull, CT}0}3}0}-1}4}10/22/2016}Wonderful soba noodles with some truly interesting and unique dishes. Great location close to grand Central always worth the stop.
Jessica N.}Happy Valley, OR}13}17}0}-1}4}10/9/2016}Definitely could taste the quality here. We had the house specials: octopus with squid ink and some special kind of beef cooked on a hot stone right at your table; along with udon, chicken karaage, and braised pork belly--the latter two being the highlights. Sooooo amazing. Also had strawberry yuzu, which went down smooth and very tasty! Service was great and very quick. I bet everything else on the menu is as authentic and delicious as what we sampled tonight, though the udon was a bit pricy for a bowl of just thin chewy noodles and two slices of fish cake. Still tasty, but would probably stick with the seafood and meat dishes instead of noodle dishes.
Wendy Z.}Manhattan, NY}19}108}113}-1}5}10/9/2016}This was one of the yummiest Japanese places I've been but also the hardest to find. Lol. It's located inside a corporate buildings basement but unsure the debit it's so adorably cute and reminds you of Japan.Once inside the service is really nice and it's a bit dimly lit (came for dinner) and we weren't seated close to other parties so it was great for my group to just talk and enjoy our dinner. We ordered a variety of food but their chirashi was sooo good. If you have a large party I would recommend sharing dishes so you can try a bit of everything. Overall the food was fresh, great service and attentive staff so it was nice! Would come again next time for lunch because their lunch specials are amazing!! But varies depending on which day you come.
Dongming F.}Manhattan, NY}33}3}0}-1}1}10/9/2016}We had one of worst experience there. On Jul 4 2016 we had dinner there and my wife left her scarf there but luckily she realised it once getting outside as it was raining. She went back while we tried to get a cab. It took quite a while before my wife came out obviously upset. It turned out the waiter for our table denied seeing any scarf. My wife then checked at the counter with little help received until a Mexican looking waiter came by starting to help checking around the shelves near the counter and the kitchen. Then the one at the counter pull a scarf from the upper shelf and asked unwillingly, is this yours? My wife was naturally very upset and shocked as such obvious and outrageous wrongdoing. We needed rush to watch the fireworks that night then returned HK days afterwards. However we have to register this to the readers. Otherwise, the food is average and again we are shocked at such behaviour at Manhattan.
M. R.}Manhattan, NY}9}114}18}-1}5}10/8/2016}Amazing on every level.You're not living to the fullest if you miss this place.
Bobby L.}Brooklyn, NY}36}7}6}-1}5}10/4/2016}Sakagura is one of my favorite spots in the city. It might be difficult to find, being in the basement of an office building. This is very much like the Tokyo experience where great restaurants can be found in hidden places. Once inside, you are transported to a scene reminiscent of Kyoto. The decor is seasonal (cherry blossoms in the spring, Japanese red maples in the fall). The service is up to Japanese standards and the food is excellent. The sake list is one of the most extensive in the city; in fact this is a sake bar first and a restaurant second although you wouldn't be able to tell with such great food quality.
Sophia J.}Oakland Gardens, NY}540}27}16}-1}4}10/3/2016}My boyfriend brought me here for a Friday date night. I was wary of it at first, and didn't realize it was a hidden restaurant style place. He led me into an office building and down these sketchy stairs. But we got to the front of the restaurant and it looked okay. He unfortunately did not make a reservation beforehand, but i'd definitely recommend doing so. This place was packed! We decided to wait and go to the restaurant next door/upstairs and have a drink there. I think it was their sister restaurant or something like that, it was also Japanese.When we were seated, the service was pretty great. Our waiter came to us at the appropriate times and kept our water, tea, and drinks refilled. We got mostly chicken dishes, but my favorite dish we got was the pork belly, Buta Kakuni. The meat was so tender and the flavor was great, my boyfriend was sad when they took the bowl away because he had actually thought about dipping things into the leftover soup sauce because it was so good! I also got a Yuzu Fruit Sake drink -- I can't remember the name of it, but it was DELICIOUS. It was served in a champagne type of glass, and although the portion size was incredibly small, it was very very delicious and one of the best drinks I've ever had. I wish a lot of their portion sizes (drinks and food) were just slightly larger, but our bill was not too bad. I'd come back with another couple or two other friends so we could get more small dishes to share and try. This place would be good for small groups (6 or less). Everything we got was great!The ambiance of this place is really amazing. There's a lot of Japanese decor, but what impressed me the most were their restrooms. It's located towards the front of the restaurant, and looks like a giant bamboo tank. Very cool and modern looking, and didn't look like a bathroom would be located in it. Once you're in the bathroom, you'll see that they have the toilets that clean your butt afterwards... very interesting and I had to try it.
Nancy Q.}Springfield, VA}0}3}0}-1}4}10/2/2016}A cute basement treasure of great Japanese dishes. Hard to find, restaurant is located under the basement. Everything was great!
Jennifer Z.}Hoboken, NJ}239}120}641}-1}5}10/2/2016}Definitely not a super easy to find spot and often times there are waits. It's located in the basement of a midtown office building. Wifi/service is also spotty in the restaurant but they do over a free wifi for customers to use.Fantastic lunch or dinner spot. While pricey, I think their dishes are totally creative and absolutely delicious. My favorite would have to be the uni soba, which I could never get sick of! For a great option, they do have a prix fixe lunch option which is pretty economical.
Colin C.}Manhattan, NY}8}29}1}-1}4}10/2/2016}This place is just amazing, everything on the menu is so good.    Had the sushi and  cold soba noodles with uni and it was so good I wanted to have another serving even though I was so full.
Max S.}New York, NY}86}39}442}-1}4}10/1/2016}Sakagura is a great place to have a variety if japanese food. Great food, nice employees, and the atmosphere  Ill say much better than EN or sobatotto. Service was great. Everybody knew their roles and know how to do it. They reflect right seay when u need them, u will be feeling good from their professional serving and treated classiclally gentle. Food was just great. Uni soba had, i guess, the uni infused soup or sauce which taste amazing. The crabliver scent from the crab rice almost get me to the org***. Doesnt really taste like crabbutter but still was amazing. Price was not really expensive and had gorgeous sake list. I dont know when they opened but interior was formed, filled and heavy. Well, its really hard to find the entrance and the easement to get to the restaurant which located on a basement of an office looking building and honestly the passageway feels like walking on a ghetto street. But once u walks in u will see what im talking about formed. They will just need to replace the table and chairs. It looked like a table in chinese delivery restaurant.
Nana Y.}Irvine, CA}72}16}128}-1}5}9/28/2016}Very Japanese flavor, fresh fish, can't miss the uni here, it was like they just got them from the ocean
Houston A.}Manhattan, NY}0}29}5}-1}2}9/24/2016}Have to give this place a 2 stars though wanted to give it higher rating. I've been go to this place couple times. I like its environment, nice, chic, and good for talk. However, I don't think the food worths the price. Especially, the recent visit, I feel the service is not as good as before. The price of its lunch special is very affordable but always with lots of carb, i.e. rice, soba, etc. So I don't like it. Even if you order some other bowls, the meat or tempura over the rice is tiny and no veg at all. From the food quality perspective, it is definitely overpriced: a bowl of rice+a plate of soba+a tiny piece of fish. Also its lunch special has quality limits, so before you order it make sure they still have it. The dinner is better. But you have to order lots of dish to make sure that you have enough to eat. In previous experience, it provides warm towel before eating, but not recent visits. Also the staff once chased us out for more tips. I don't know what happened in this place, but maybe won't visit it any more or recommend friends to come.
Rebecca H.}New York, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}9/20/2016}Gorgeous food, nice environment. Lunch is of great value. This is definitely one of my favorite place.
Frank W.}San Francisco, CA}18}195}397}-1}5}9/19/2016}An underground gem. It's in the basement, down stairs that appear to lead someplace seedy but actually open to an authentic Japanese restaurant, right down to the jazz soundtrack. The ingredients are excellent, the preparation classy, and the service impeccable. I had sashimi moriwase. The exact items change daily. I also had the poached egg with ikira and uni. It was cold, which I had not expected. The rice was perfect. Japanese style. The waitress poured the beer very slowly to avoid a problem. Altogether five people served me.Pricey but not outrageous. Highly recommended.
Cindy C.}Chelsea, Manhattan, NY}0}83}82}-1}3}9/16/2016}Cute hidden gem of nyc. It has a nice ambient and its fun feeling like you have discovered a restaurant thats in a basement through a tricky entrance... Lol. Food portions are pretty small and pricey. Food is decent but again, pricey for what you'll be given.
Alice S.}San Francisco, CA}292}135}282}18}4}9/16/2016}Wow, one of the most expensive meals I've had and the portions are super small, but the food is delicious. I came here with two friends and we ordered several dishes to share. The Buta Kakuni (pork belly) was by farrr the most amazing pork belly I've ever tasted in my lifeee. It was so soft and tender and it just melts straight on your tongue. I also enjoyed the Atsuyaki Tomago (egg with eel), fried shrimp rolls, Amaebi shutouae (shrimp), and the hot stone beef. The shrimp was super tiny and the beef was on the special menu and a bit overrated in my opinion, but still pretty enjoyable overall. We also ordered the uni soba and the crab rice clay pot which were bigger portions than the other items, but I wasn't the biggest fan. We picked the black seseame creme brulee for dessert it was amazing! This place can be a bit hard to find because there was construction in front of the building when I went, and you also have to go through a lobby and go down a sketchy staircase to get to the restaurant. But the ambiance once you're inside is pretty nice.
Santo P.}New York, NY}8}16}66}-1}1}9/13/2016}Absolutely horrible service. The waiter took for ever on taking our order and once we finished we asked 3 different people for the check but apparently they all have to wait for the "slow" waiter who was busy taking an order so we waited another 20min for the check. On the way out we asked to speak to a manager but "the manager" was no place to be found. I really hope someone in upper management read this to evaluate the type of service being giving now a days. The place still busy so perhaps the staff don't care about taking care of the guest no more. Too bad because Sakagura was my favorite sake bar. No more !
Shiri A.}Miami, FL}3}16}27}-1}5}9/12/2016}Great authentic Japanese restaurant,  great service, fair price.  Will be back for sure next visit in the the big Apple
Stefany W.}Manhattan, NY}196}181}15}18}3}9/12/2016}Came here for lunch and they were mostly serving donburi and soba noodles.  For the amount of food given and price and quality, I would suggest going next doors - Soba Totto.  I should come back again for the izakaya aspect during dinner hours but for lunch, it will be a pass.I ordered the curry soba and while it was good, it wasn't anything crazy.
Juan T.}Columbus, OH}31}17}61}-1}5}9/9/2016}My favorite restaurant to visit when I'm in Midtown NY for work. I like everything about it, the food, the location, the service, the character it has, the price and even the restrooms!  I usually order a little of everything, in this case the Pork Belly, Tuna Tartar, Fluke Sashimi, Beef Carpaccio and grilled Squid. I recommend all, but the Pork Belly was my favorite this time as far as the food. Now, as far as dessert, you have to try the Sesame Creme Brûlée, I mean, I almost liked the container, amazing. All this with half a bottle of Sake for $120, a good price for the amount and quality of food especially in the center of NY.
New Yorker N.}New York, NY}1}87}1}-1}5}9/7/2016}Sakagura is a unique restaurant in NYC. Really, I don't of places that could compare to this. The food is excellent. I find it hard to eat healthy there, but it's worth it. It's an unusual menu and everything tastes delicious. Unpretentious atmosphere. Must try it!
Tammie K.}New York, NY}279}157}133}18}4}9/7/2016}When my friend told me he called in to make a reservation for a Monday night dinner, I thought he was being silly. Will it really be THAT crowded? I was wrong, of course. The place was packed.Sakagura is tucked inside the basement of a commercial building. As soon as you step down the stairs, it almost feels as if you've been transported to an authentic izakaya in Japan. The ambience is intimate, with most tables occupied by couples staring lovingly at each other or buddies catching up on the latest gossip. Of course, there are the few parties of rowdy co-workers most likely celebrating the sealing of a new deal. The point is, people who come here are gonna stay for a while and the relatively slow service of Sakagura makes it extra easy to do so. Another reason to make a reservation.The food menu is extensive here, with the sake menu being even more so. My friend and I picked a few things we absolutely wanted to try, and then asked our server for further recommendations. Our server was extremely helpful and even helped us navigate through the sake menu before we finally settled for the Yuzu Sake (which was delicious, btw).Pretty much everything we ordered was tasty, and I would really encourage looking through all the options and picking out things that interest you. My favorite items were the tori karaage (fried chicken) and the salmon chirashi. The buta kakuni (pork belly) is supposed to be the restaurant's signature dish, but I found it to be only OK. As a whole, Sakagura is great and I can definitely see myself coming again and again.
Elsie W.}Queens, NY}410}1620}3491}18}5}9/7/2016}I took my mom here for lunch once and she was impressed -- she's never impressed, so this must be good. Get their lunch sets! It comes in a 3-tiered thing with entree, sashimi, udon, etc. So worth it. I also like that this place is hidden in the basement inside a building. It took me longer than expected to find it, I must admit... I can't believe I never reviewed the best Japanese lunch spot in Midtown!
Gwen G.}New York, NY}47}184}1092}18}3}9/6/2016}It's quite confusing to find this place. It is inside an office building in the basement. You will need to enter the building and there's a door right next to the elevator which is always open. You will see a stairs and it is right there one flight down. It's a cute Japanese place. It was designed nicely for a basement restaurant. They will not seat you until everyone in your party is present. It's a good lunch place. They have a good selection of lunch sets which mostly include soba noodles hot or cold. It's quite alright for me. The fish bowl is few pieces of sashimi and rice. And the set is a rice bowl and a side of soba noodles. Too much carbs and a few pieces of fish. I think it's quite on the top prize for lunch which is mostly carbs. The chocolate sorbet is great. It's very good to try. I think they have a better dinner selection.
Boris A.}Manhattan, NY}0}25}1}-1}2}9/2/2016}Been here several times - usually quite good and worth the slightly higher price. Unfortunately, the hostess on 09/01/16 around 6:30pm was a true Bee Eye Tea Cee H. She was curt, rude,  unaccommodating, and had no sense of humor. Clearly a terrible fit for her job. It's really unfortunate when the hostess starts your night out badly and puts your company in a awkward mood. That said, the food mostly made up for the unpleasant welcome even though the service was slow. Doubt we'll be coming back or taking our clients here again.
Carly W.}Los Angeles, CA}3}62}8}-1}5}8/30/2016}Outrageously good. It's criminal that I lived here for years before I knew this incredible little gem was lurking in a basement in midtown. You won't have a bad night here, but you might have one of the best meals of your year. Get their signature pork dish... and be prepared to order it again so other people at the table can have a crack at it.
Sah-Yu G.}Baton Rouge, LA}0}25}31}-1}4}8/30/2016}In the basement inside a building, no street entrance, kind of strange location. Interior is not fancy but ok. Table is small. Ordered the daily special Miyazaki beef on hot stone--- but the stone cool down so rapidly that I couldn't finish grilling.  The bartender is nice enough to give me another hot stone . The price is cheap compared to others with similar quality.
Peggie Y.}New York, NY}182}166}2122}18}4}8/28/2016}This place is a Japanese izakaya at the basement of a commercial building.  You would see the sign Sakagura on the wall to the right of the building.  Once you walk in, walk past the security/reception area.  The door to the stairs is to the left of the elevators.  Once you walk down the stairs, you would see this beautifully decorated restaurant named Sakagura.  They have an extensive of sake served at this place.  Their signature dish, the pork belly, is a must-try.  It is a bug trunk of pork belly simmered in a rich broth.  The meat soaks up all the broth and it's flaky and moist.  When I go next time, I would definitely order 2 pieces :).   I also ordered the "black soy bean" ( quoted from the menu), the edamame was huge and well seasoned.   For entree, we ordered both the cold and hot Inaniwa udon.  The hot udon is cooked in a light broth with fish paste and citrus flavor.  The cold udon comes with a bonito infused broth, lime and a poached egg.  My friend and I both find the cold udon more flavorful.The highlight of the night, besides the pork belly, would be their desserts.  Instead of boring green tea cake that you find at most Japanese restaurant, they have seasonal item such as the mango pudding with passionfruit ice-cream.  Old fashioned Japanese dessert like the coffee jello.   They also have lychee sorbet!!   We ordered the mango pudding and lychee sorbet, both were memorable and delicious.   I love the balance of the acidity from the passionfruit sorbet mixed with the not-so-sweet mango pudding.   The lychee sorbet tastes exactly like you are having real lychee (I made that comment during dinner and my friend thought it's a silly comment.) Overall, I would recommend this place for dinner.   When I left, there were some brochures that came with the check, it looks like they have good lunch specials.   I would definitely want to try their lunch options in the future.
Tian L.}BELLE MEAD, NJ}1}19}4}-1}5}8/26/2016}Very original Japanse food. Our party had 6 people, so we tried many things. My favorite is the steamed egg custard. Wonderfully soft and tasty. A great dish to have on a cold wet day.This place is very hard to find, give yourself some additional time.
Tina K.}Manhattan, NY}1}35}1}-1}4}8/22/2016}A little hidden gem!! Lovely food and sake- portions are tiny and pricey but you get what you pay for! I have been here a few times now and enjoyed most of the menu but my one disappointment is the snow crab rice- not a lot if crab OR flavour.
ChingWa C.}Manhattan, NY}136}157}222}18}4}8/19/2016}First of all, this place is really hidden. It is located in the basement of this one office building. The restaurant's decoration is really neat. I made a reservation for two to dine at noon on Thursday, with an intention of getting their Thursday lunch special. Although Open Table doesn't have a lot of openings, that place wasn't that packed and there were at least 5 empty tables. So, my co-worker and I were so pumped up to get the lunch special, and the first thing the waitress said to us was that their lunch special was sold out :( They serve 30 orders a day for the lunch special, and she said they are usually sold out of it by noon (they open at 11:30a). I ended up getting the Sake Ikura Don Set, which is amazing. I have just been craving for chirashi for about a week :( definitely going back to get it.
Sherry Z.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}208}124}360}-1}3}8/18/2016}This review is for lunch only. The service is terrible! We asked for water like four times and they still forgot about it! The waiter was very slow on taking orders and getting us the check. The flavor of the food was just okay but of good value. The lunch set came with rice and a soba. So much food; even too much rice in particular. I got the shrimp tempura don. There were three shrimps covering a giant ball of rice underneath.Perhaps good for a work lunch and a satisfying bite of you are around. Not really worth a special trip to get lunch here.
Jeffrey B.}Seattle, WA}94}4}1}-1}4}8/15/2016}Just what I needed: a semi-hidden, cozy, yet lively Japanese comfort food spot. GTK: no cellphones work down here! And no wifi! (Just what you might need!)I had three tapas-portioned dishes, and it was the perfect amount of food. Top-quality ingredients in: 1) a chilled tofu dish, 2) marinated black cod, and 3) tempura vegetables in a sweet soy broth. I trusted my waitress on the sake selection, and it was spot on. Lots to choose from.Super attentive staff. I would recommend to anyone visiting or working in the area.
Jasmine W.}Manhattan, NY}306}1}0}-1}5}8/14/2016}Excellent experience. Friendly staff and cozy ambiance. Will come back for other things on the menu
Angela K.}Manhattan, NY}355}338}110}18}4}8/14/2016}Delicious with great wait staff. Came on a Saturday night around 7pm and was able to get seated right away for a party of two.Buta kakuni (pork belly in a warm dashi broth): super tender and fell apart easily (in a desirable way). Really liked the dashi broth - not too overwhelming where you couldn't enjoy the pork belly, while being extremely flavorful. A must get.Unagi wrapped in tamago: not a huge fan. Tamago and unagi both had good flavor and the egg was very flavorful, but we barely got any unagi! It came on a plate with four tamago pieces, but only two of them contained unagi (and very tiny pieces). If you're looking for more unagi, I would pass on this dish. It was pretty much all egg.Grilled salmon topped with ikura (salmon roe): I really enjoyed this dish. Salmon was grilled well without being too overcooked, and they were very generous with the ikura topping.Gindara yuan yaki (black cod): loved this dish. Had a soft, buttery texture to it, and the soy sauce gave it a light, sweet flavor without going over the top.Friend and I also shared a glass of Tamegawa sake for taste, for which they brought us individual glasses. Overall service was attentive and friendly. Highly recommend.
Phina D.}New York, NY}0}365}0}-1}5}8/11/2016}It's really interesting where this restaurant is located and I love that it's hidden. My favorite dish here is the beef back , the meat is so tender. Their portions are very small and it's like tapa style Japanese
Nina T.}New York, NY}11}16}67}-1}3}8/10/2016}3 star for its lunch. I got the tempura which was nice but nothing excited. Then I got the hot soba noodle with roasted duck and mushroom. It was $15 but the noodle was very plain. Two mushroom floated in the soup. The duck tasted good but it would not add up score for the plate anyway. The taste wasn't bad but feel like it's not worth the price.
Toshie O.}Forest Hills, NY}0}59}5}-1}3}8/9/2016}I come to Sakagura for Sake, not for Food. But I felt the quality of food was not good as before. Edamame tasted as if they just microwaved leftover. Spinach Gomaae was watery.
Kevin H.}Washington, DC}246}152}318}18}4}8/6/2016}This place is a traditional Japanese restaurant with a modern twist In a basement of a office building. Place is super clean but the tables are pretty close to each other. There is a large sushi bar area if you are going during lunch time so you can get seated pretty fast.The place specializes in sake and soba noodles(hot or cold). I had the sashimi and soba noodles combination. The sashimi compared to other higher end sashimi places isn't that great. However- the soba compensates for it. I got cold ones and they did a really good job on it. The soba noodles is the traditional method of dipping it into a sauce so you can control the sauce intake. One big recommendation is to try their limited wheat ale beer. I usually don't order beer during lunch but it was a Friday. Why not? The beer was super flavorful and has a nice finish to it. Claims to be a low calorie beer too. Prices are all reasonable. The convention I had was 22 bucks and it is really filling for lunch! Turnover is fast so people are in out, especially during lunch!
Angela H.}Brooklyn, NY}26}16}33}-1}3}8/3/2016}Came here for a double date and after reading all the reviews I thought this place would be awesome!  Most dishes we ordered was a little too salty for our taste. I must say the pork belly was amazing though. It wasn't salty nor too sweet and with just the right amount of meat and fat. I would come back just for that dish. Service was good and waiters were nice but I didn't like that the waiters keep coming back to take away our plates while we were having a lovely conversation. They came and asked us to hand over the plates, utensils and cups at least 3 times at the end. Since we finished our food and just having the last of our sake, it would've been better if you let us finish our last cup and take away our plates afterwards instead of coming back 3 times asking for us to hand it to you and making us feel like it's time to go. Overall this was still a good restaurant to try out if you're in the city.
Sha P.}Manhattan, NY}7}66}101}-1}4}8/2/2016}One of my favorite Japanese places in the city. My brother got me hooked on this place. Reservations are a little hard to get, so plan ahead! So glad i live around the area!This place is tucked away in the basement of an office building. Im sure a lot of people come into the building super confused...don't be.. you are at the right place. hahaBe adventurous. Just order random things off the menu!
Irene H.}Boston, MA}330}221}259}18}5}8/2/2016}This place is pretty hidden, enter the building and walk past the security desk and down the hall there will be a door with 'Sakagura' on it and then you just follow that to the restaurant. It is definitely worth it! The portions are small since they are all meant to be 'small eats'. But everything that we ordered was delicious! Just expect to spend a little more if you want to be full. The wagyu beed tataki was by far my favorite dish that we ordered that night! We ended up ordering it again after the first serving was wolfed down within minutes. We also ordered the Maguro tartare, assortment of sashimi, tori karaage and buta kakuni. The fish were all super fresh. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the udon but I think Japanese style udon is just a little lighter on the flavor than the one that I am used to (my mom's cooking).Overall, I love this place, great atmosphere, service, and food! I will definitely be back!
Sawako Y.}Manhattan, NY}41}2}133}-1}4}7/31/2016}Just added to my list of great Japanese restaurants in NYC!In the basement of an office building, but has the feel of a nice izakaya (Japanese pub) in Japan--including the good service.Portions are Japanese-sized, so you can try various dishes, which is always fun.They also have a very wide range of sake, including plum wine and yuzu (citrus) wine.For food, we ordered:1. Gomoku Kinpira2. Maguro Tartar3. Tofu Salad4. Tori Tsukune5. Miyazakigyu Ishiyaki6. Kani Donabe Meshi7. Chocolate SouffléThe Miyazakigyu Ishiyaki (hot stone grilled Miyazaki beef) and chocolate soufflé were both delicious and absolutely mouth-watering!If you like rice, I also recommend the Kani Donabe Meshi. (steamed rice with crab meat)I look forward to going again to try more tasty drinks and dishes.
Charles J.}Manhattan, NY}0}40}0}-1}5}7/30/2016}I'm a vegetarian. I absolutely loved the food here. Try the eggplant, the pickles, the grilled rice ball, the donuts!! Everything was delicious and interesting. I had a sake flight - also great. Will definitely come again.
Kate M.}Los Angeles, CA}292}436}0}-1}5}7/29/2016}Sakagura's uni soba is one of the most exquisite dishes I've ever had, both to eat and to look at. It was salty, sweet, herbal, creamy, and umami-rich, and I could sip the uni broth for days. It arrived in a dramatic white ceramic bowl hand-painted with thin black lines that fell to the center and practically erupted into the mountain of noodles and urchin.The staff is wonderful, too--I asked the hosts if they had sold out of the dish on arrival (at nearly 1 p.m.), and they checked and said they hadn't. When I reflexively clapped and grinned, they matched my excitement and promised to reserve one of the remaining few for me. (About twenty minutes later, they had sold out.) Everyone clearly works very hard and takes pride in their work, and I felt so well taken care of.My only regret is not asking more about how it was made. I live across the country and can't wait another year or more until the next time I get to enjoy this!
Ken S.}Manhattan, NY}443}556}4202}18}4}7/29/2016Updatedreview}KenScale: 8.5/10I've been living in the same Midtown East neighborhood ever since I moved to New York almost five years ago. I've always had the temptation to move to cooler neighborhoods in downtown Manhattan, but just found the comfort of living nearby my work around Grand Central station area too convenient to make that move. Midtown East is one of the more barren areas when it comes to restaurants, but there are some solid Japanese places in the neighborhood. Sakagura has long been one of the spots that I would love to go every once in a while; at this subterranean izakaya-style establishment, sake is not the only strength. In fact, after recent visit with my mom and a friend, I think Sakagura is one of the more underrated places when it comes to Japanese cuisine in the city.There is no magic or trick used at Sakagura; it's just straightforward Japanese food. The strength of this restaurant lies in execution faithful to Japanese traditional flavor and texture that provides so much satisfaction without being fussy. The sushi assortment (this time, we had uni, medium fatty tuna, amberjack, striped jack mackerel and red snapper) is certainly an above-average plate with very fresh texture of each piece that would make for an excellent starter everywhere. One of the specials on the menu, grilled salmon collar, was cooked more or less perfectly and had modest flavor to maximize the texture of the fish. I've always been a fan of black cod with miso sauce in Japanese restaurants, and the grilled fillets of black cod in sweet soy sauce served by Sakagura was quite excellent as well, again with more or less perfectly grilled fish that was melting in my mouth. The braised pork belly, which the menu says is the restaurant's signature dish, didn't look too appetizing when it came out, but had juicy, tender meat that brought smiles to everyone. The steamed rice dish cooked with snow crab meat and crab butter, according to the menu, is supposed to take 40-50 minutes to prepare, but no one was complaining as the rice that came out turned out to be a nice exclamation point to a very satisfying meal. I really enjoyed the moderately firm texture of the rice that worked harmoniously with snow crab meat for a subtle yet elegant dish. Getting a reservation at Sakagura can still be a challenge, so book early if possible. As always, even though the space is usually packed with corporate crowds, the modern and cozy décor is another attraction to this restaurant; an impressive list of sakes is another plus. Japanese food is one of my favorite cuisines so I typically have a fairly high standard when checking out Japanese restaurants. I can now declare with confidence that Sakagura is definitely one of the better places in the city if you want to explore the taste of Japan in an intimate setting.
Carol B.}Manhattan, NY}18}91}44}-1}2}7/28/2016}Truly disappointing! Me and my husband has heard great reviews about this place but it definitely did not meet our expectations. Long story short, the food was mediocre! I'll give it 1 star for service and 1 star for atmosphere... But I really can't say anything good about the food.The things we ordered were all very small portioned. The egg and uni dish literally tasted like egg. The uni's extreme flavor did not shine through and they were extremely stingy with the uni size. The steak beef thing tasted awful; super salty and the beef was very hard. The salmon and roe over rice was OK. They were extremely stingy with the rice, you only get about 0.4 inch of rice. Not satisfying at all!!!!! Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this restaurant. This is a lesson to be learned: don't always trust yelp.
Chris W.}Tampa, FL}0}8}4}-1}5}7/26/2016}First, thanks my friend who told me this place. It's a little hard to find, but it's  totally worth for finding it. We came by around 6:10pm, there is only one table for two persons left. And the waitress is a sweet girl, we order some tuna with sticky beans, it's interesting but nice taste. My favorite dishes are tea soup rice with plum and UNI COLD SOBA! You must try the noddles! And the grilled black cod is also good, especially the sweet soy sauce inside. When Next time I visit NYC, I must come back this place.
Ching Po H.}New York, NY}1}17}22}-1}4}7/26/2016}Foods are ok, not great! The beef tongue was very disappointing, super salty. I got allergic reaction to the cold duck and i only will have that reaction when the meats are not fresh and raw.
Ann W.}Tampa, FL}8}45}14}-1}5}7/24/2016}I feel like I have been let in on a secret! This Manhattan basement dwelling Japanese restaurant is as authentic as it gets. This is not your typical sushi bar with California rolls by any means.  It's really important to make a reservation or you may not get a table.The place is dark with low tables and what looks like numerous rooms.  The service is great and very punctual. The soba noodle choices are plentiful and mouthwatering. I highly recommend anyone of them.  The chicken with soy and ginger is light and a great blend of flavors. The pork belly dish is awesome too. On to the saki, well the choices are endless and I wish I was there with my Japanese friends to help choose a few of their favorites.The portions are on the small side and expensive but well worth a trip to the East Side to be transported to Japan.
Fred Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}7/24/2016}This place is awesome.  The food has been consistent over the years and the service is great.  Pricey, yes, but if you refrain from the expensive sake you can keep the tab reasonable by the end of the night.
Sil P.}Midtown East, Manhattan, NY}0}5}1}-1}5}7/22/2016}Favorite deserts in town especially the creme brûlée and the chocolate souffléLove the atmosphereVery good food as well ( original)Service can be improved especially in relation to explaining what is in the menu
Mengze Z.}New York, NY}44}98}145}-1}4}7/14/2016}Good dining experience overall, the beef tongue is on the salty side, the sesame ice cream dessert is recommended.
Nikhita T.}New York, NY}63}11}0}-1}5}7/14/2016}Delicious food, excellent service, and delectable desserts. My colleagues and I ordered the Tenzaru, "Jewel" Oke Bento, and Sashimi Soba Gozen. For dessert we had the salted chocolate sorbet. Everything was so good and I can't wait to eat here again!
Patricia T.}Brooklyn, NY}83}3}0}-1}4}7/11/2016}The service is excellent, great atmosphere, and very good food. I recommend the pickled vegetables and the hot udon.
Monica T.}New York, NY}65}635}574}-1}5}7/10/2016}This place is so good! First off, please make reservation before you swing by or you might have to wait or get turn down :(. The restaurant is in the basement of the building, but it's a big spot. There are bar seatings, table and booth.We came here in May to celebrate our anniversary. We got here on time for our reservation but waited for about 5 minutes before seated. We know the plates portion are kinda small (per pictures) and ordered beef tataki, pork belly, onsen egg with uni, the chef's special beef (hot stone and cook at table), cold uni soba, some rib eye dish and another round of pork belly and something else + 2 desserts. At first our waiter was surprised and told us it was a lot of food, but no.... we ordered seconds ....'Food was delicious, our favorite is the pork belly, beef tataki and the hot stone beef (but for the price it was more novelty). It was a delicious meal.
Alex K.}Roseland, NJ}195}83}8}-1}5}7/9/2016}Great place, a little hard to find cause its located in the basement of the building! The sake was really good and the tapa small dishes were delicious. Definitely try their black cod and pork belly. Loved the ambience and all the empty sake bottles on the wall. Had a very Japanese feel to it (Not that I really know what that feels like). A little pricey but would come here again for a special occasion
Joy G.}New York, NY}1082}732}109}18}5}7/8/2016}After eating here once three years ago, I've finally made it back to my favorite basement dweller! Just kidding, Sakagura, your hidden-in-plain-sight impresses me every time. Keep an eye out for the two characters and "Stair F." The next most important thing to remember is to make a reservation. I haven't tried walking in without one, but given how packed the place was at the early-bird hour of noon (well, early for midtown), I wouldn't chance it unless I felt like waiting (which is never). Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The best thing, if you can get there on time, is either the $11.50 daily special (which usually sells out at around 11:45 a.m.) or the Jewel box, which comes with two pieces of deep-fried veggies, an assortment of sashimi, and three rice balls. My favorite thing off that platter was tamago with a bit of eel tucked inside. Godly. The desserts are typically dainty. I could have eaten 5 of the mango puddings. The chocolate souffle with the raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream was the winner at the table. NEXT TIME: duck soba; lunch tasting course; kaisen don; eel rice bowl; black sesame creme brulee
Darren X.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}7/8/2016}Great atmosphere, delicate food prepared, wide selection of sake available.
Jocelyn K.}Jersey City, NJ}443}810}4544}18}5}7/4/2016Updatedreview}I came here for the first time for dinner after finding out the restaurant I originally wanted to go to was completely booked out for a private party. We came on a Wednesday night around 7pm and waited close to an hour just to get seated for a group of four. The previous time I came here was for lunch at the bar. The dinner experience was completely different with a menu in a more tapas style. Gyusujii (Shredded Beef Back Ribs and Konjac Yam stewed in Miso topped with Scallion) - This dish is small, but packs a lot of savory flavor. The beef is extremely tender and served with these jelly cubes that I assume was the Konjac Yam. If I had a bowl of rice I would have poured the leftover sauce over it.Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly braised tender and served hot) - Sakagura's signature dish and rightly so. The pork belly was tender as described on the menu and melt in your mouth. I love the fatty pieces but tend to avoid it since it's so unhealthy. Thankfully there were enough hefty meaty parts of the pork belly to balance out the fat.Atsuyaki Tamagoyaki with eel (Japanese Style Egg Omelette, wrapped around Grilled Eel) - I originally wanted to order the Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago, but they were out of uni so ordered this instead.The eel didn't make the omelette anymore special, but the egg was very fluffy. I probably wouldn't order this again though.Chawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard served with Chicken, Shrimp and Shiitake, Gingko Nuts topped with a Thickened Ponzu Soup) - A typical steamed egg custard. I think it could have used a lot more fillings in the egg, but the egg itself was very soft and warming.Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Fillets of Black Cod Fish steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce) - My favorite thing we ordered. The sweet soy sauce glaze made the flaky fish so addicting. There was one piece that was slightly drier than the other, but the people in my group couldn't get enough of this fish. In fact, they ate way too much of it. I wanted the whole thing to myself.Tori-Karaage (Deep Fried Chicken Thigh marinated in Sake and Ginger Infused Soy Sauce) - You can't go wrong with Karaage. The breading was crispy and the chicken was juicy. Always a safe dish to order.Jagaimo Dango (Fluffy Donuts with a Mashed Potato Center served with Matcha Salt) - My friend didn't really like this, but I enjoyed the fluffy, somewhat bready texture of the donut. The center didn't really taste or feel anything like mashed potatoes and seemed to just meld with the rest of the donut. Dipping it in matcha salt really enhanced the flavor, otherwise the donut would have been one note and boring.My friend also ordered the Hot Inaniwa Udon, which was brought out last since according to our waiter the noodles dishes are always last. I didn't taste any of it, but he seemed to have liked it. Which is saying a lot, since he's French and doesn't eat a lot of Japanese cuisine.Dinner here was definitely worth the wait. I recommend coming here for dinner over lunch. The restaurant itself is beautiful, the service is slightly aloof but polite enough, and the food is light but comforting. I'm still disappointed I wasn't able to go to the original restaurant I wanted, but this more than made up for it.
Matt P.}New York, NY}1156}311}51}18}4}6/29/2016}Off-the-beaten path is an understatement. Especially in such a busy, white-collar area like this. For a brief moment, I felt like I was back in Tokyo. And that's definitely a good thing. When ordering soba, always go hot. Always. Any excess broth can be mixed with any remaining rice dish you have. Perhaps that's the Filipino in me coming out. Our carb game is on point.Keep in mind, the desserts will take awhile. A seemingly obscene amount of time, especially if you're still craving. Rest assured, they will be totally worth the wait, handcrafted and made-to-order. Go for anything with red bean in it. The world needs more red bean
Annabelle M.}Manhattan, NY}26}143}119}-1}5}6/25/2016}Delectable food, flawless service, fun atmosphere.Before I start raving about each dish, let me put a disclaimer: my boyfriend's mother generously gave us a dinner voucher for this restaurant. On the voucher it specified certain dishes eligible for it, but when we arrived at the restaurant, to our pleasant surprise, they said the voucher is worth $200. Here we go...Dish 1:Seaweed Salad - came out extremely fast. The portion was large enough for the two of us to not only share but also keep on the side to eat with other entrées. Dish 2:Ebi Stick - there are six, and they come with miso dipping sauce that we couldn't get enough of. They're only slightly fried and the fried layer is thin, so you don't feel guilty eating many of them :)Dish 3:Kamo Roast Negimaki - one of my two favorite dishes of the night. Six chilled slices of duck tasted like fireworks in my mouth after I dipped them in the basil sauce. Note: they're medium-rare to medium. Dish 4:Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago - how can you go wrong with sea urchin and egg?! You simply can't. This is my go-to dish at any Japanese restaurant and Sakagura certainly didn't disappoint with this one. Dish 5:Yuba Shumai - like the ebi sticks, the dumpling wraps were very thin, putting the focus on the pork inside. They come in threes. Dish 6:Gindara Yuan Yaki - the black cod melts in your mouth like butter. I especially liked the presentation of this dish, with three separate pieces of cod decorated with some vegetables. Dish 7:Buta Kakuni - two notes: 1. This is a Sakagura specialty dish and 2. This is a giant piece of pork belly with the perfect amount of fat and level of chewiness. Dish 8:Agedashi Tofu - you know the tofu has been cooked to perfection when it breaks so softly as you try to grab it with your chopsticks. Dish 9:Washu Beef Tataki - six bite-sized pieces that come out raw. The server will then butter the stone on which you cook the beef in front of you. They cook so fast and so perfectly - they weren't too hot at all and the meat was very juicy and tasty. Dish 10:Salmon Chirashi - my other favorite item of the night. This dish is a must. The rice had turned pink from the salmon, and the flavor was acute but not overwhelming. Came with the clam miso soup (upgrade from tofu miso soup for $1). We also had two carafes of sake, which comes in a wooden Japanese box containing ice and some white flowers. The only complaint (if I can even call it that) is not even related to the food: they only have one bathroom for each gender. I had to wait 10-15 minutes to use it and had to give up and go back to my seat.Overall, this is a great place for Japanese food. In the future, I will recommend this restaurant to any visitor looking for authentic Japanese cuisine.
Elana S.}New York, NY}263}95}364}18}4}6/23/2016}I worked in that area for a while and first time I was introduced to Sakagura was when my boss took us there. If you don't know about existence of this place, there is no way you can just pass by and see it while walking. It is actually in the basement of the office building and it's quite a challenge to find a way to get in. The décor is very simple and Japanese but the authenticity is at its highest. One of the few really authentic Japanese eateries you can find in town. The service is the BESTEST!!!!!!!! We ordered bunch of dishes and shared pretty much everything, and it was good BUT what made my night in that restaurant was the desserts! We had 4-5 desserts and I can swear that those desserts were straight from heaven. The black sesame cream brule and the espresso flavored dessert were worth every calorie. My advice is order every dessert from the menu, because they all are sensational
Alyssa Y.}New York, NY}69}240}39}18}2}6/22/2016}My mom halfway through our meal: "Maybe everybody's so drunk on sake that they can't taste anything??"If you're looking for high quality Japanese food in the area, go to Jukai instead. We spent $200 for two people here, so it's not like we didn't try enough dishes to get a real sense of the food and drinks here. Sashimi was poorly cut and didn't taste fresh. All the sauces - from the agedashi tofu broth to kaiso salad dressing to soba  soup - were way too strong, with zero subtlety. Plus, our server was rude (they're giving Japanese hospitality a bad rep :().Only giving 2 stars for the sake and the toto toilets lol
Nancy Y.}Manhattan, NY}365}87}89}-1}5}6/21/2016}Definitely planning on coming back here again! My sister, cousin and I came here for my birthday on a whim when the original place we had in mind had a 45 minute wait. We were just too hungry to wait any longer. This is really close to our respective offices so we decided it would be a good place. Upon arriving, we were seated almost immediately. The waitress told us that they would need the table two hours later which was fine by us.The décor is pretty modern and surrounds the sake theme. It's a pretty large restaurant considering it's located in the basement. We had no difficultly finding it by following the signs. There is a HUGE array of sake which is larger than their actual dining menu. We decided to keep it a dry night but I plan on coming back to have a taste.We decided to just order a bunch of dishes to share. We started with the Maguro Tartar which was perfectly balanced - many places go too heavy on the yuzu. We also got the assorted sashimi, Tori Karaage, and the signature Buta Kakuni.But the Wagyu Beef Tataki was pretty much the highlight of the night. We liked it so much we ordered a second one toward the end of the meal. It was perfectly seared with just the right amount of daikon. The sauce complimented the premium beef so well that I could come back just for this dish alone.The servers were phenomenal. They were polite and courteous, topping off the wonderful traditional Japanese atmosphere. So excited for another visit!
Midori K.}Manhattan, NY}48}156}182}-1}4}6/15/2016}It was great japanese food in here. Friendly service and felt like a japan. I didn't order many dishes in here, but there are great sake selection. I should try more food in here, but a little pricey for girls night. i saw many asian guy seems to came this place after their work.
Sarah P.}Manhattan, NY}470}33}3}-1}5}6/15/2016}This place is where I go if I want to treat myself to a nice lunch that won't break the bank. Most people have a problem with the chirashi, but I usually get the baked beef curry and have gotten the guyaki bento box - both of which were amazing. I think this place's beef curry is by far my favorite in the city. This place definitely has a home cooked feel to it but only a certain number of bento boxes are prepared each day so go a little early if you want a selection or the beef curry. There's also a rewards program. Eventually you'll get a free bento box.
Yuting Z.}Manhattan, NY}358}246}444}18}4}6/15/2016}Finally came here for an impromptu dinner after having heard about it for years. The restaurant itself is located in the basement of a random office building, but the space (once you find it) is like nothing I'd ever seen before and almost makes you feel like you're not in the city anymore. Our party of 3 didn't have a reservation for a Friday night, so there was a ~45 minute wait. No problem, we put our names down (they text you!) and went to Soba Totto next door to while away the time.We shared:- Maguro yamakake (tuna sashimi with grated mountain yam): Not the best tuna sashimi I've ever had, but the combo was pretty refreshing once you added in the soy sauce. Would pass on this next time unless I was really craving some tuna.- Hirame ponzu (fluke sashimi w/ grated radish): See notes from above. The radish also slightly overwhelmed the more delicate flavor of the fish.- Amaebi shutouae (sake-cured sweet shrimp with bonito liver marinade): Way, way too salty. This was my least favorite of the night. Maybe it would've been better with a (giant) side of rice to temper the extreme flavors of the dish.- Uzaku (eel, cucumber, and seaweed): Pieces of eel arranged in a tower with thin cucumber slices and seaweed. Presentation was definitely pretty, and the fattiness of the eel itself was tempered by the freshness of the cucumbers and vinegar dressing. The eel was also amazing, with none of the tiny bones one usually would find.- Uni ikura onsen tamago (soft boiled egg, sea urchin, salmon roe): Loved this! Super creamy uni blended perfectly with all of the other elements to make a umami flavor bomb.- Washu beef tataki (seared beef sashimi with grated daikon and ponzu): Personally loved this dish. Beef was well marbled and...for lack of a better word, beefy, which contrasted with the sharpness of the daikon.- Gyutan yawakara ni (beef tongue served in a stew): This was my favorite of the night. I'd never had beef tongue that wasn't sliced thinly before, but now that I have I'm not sure I can ever go back. I would've been perfectly happy with just this and a bowl of rice for dinner. Now my mouth is watering again....- Kinmedai nitsuke (simmered sea bream in sweetened soy sauce): I had been craving fish, so one of my friends kindly ordered this for the table as well. I loved the flavor profile of the dish, but the fish itself was a bit dry.Outside of a few misses, I thought the food was great overall. The menu is also huge, so I'd definitely come back in the future given the opportunity and try some of the other dishes (along with that gyutan again...mmm).
Pamela A.}New York, NY}140}272}561}18}5}6/10/2016}My first time here for lunch was amazing. It is a little hard to find and in a sketchy lower level of a building but once you get over that, it's  fine. It is a nice restaurant. My coworker said it is one of her favorite places and I can see why; food was fresh, service was excellent and the ambiance was cozy and welcoming. My sushi rice bowl was amazing and I would definitely return for more. Also, for 3 people our meal was only $60 which in this city is a steal. Highly recommend it.
DJ M.}Melbourne, FL}0}20}0}-1}5}6/3/2016}Do not be intimidated by the hidden location, by the bar, the lengthy sake menu, the potentially neglectful server and the claustrophobic setting.  Sakagura is an extraordinary authentic delight -  dependable freshness, presentation and extensive selection of rare fruits of the sea, and transcendent sake offerings.Tremendously outstanding quality and delightful, beautiful dishes.  Roe and urchin, unbelievably fresh, a consummate experience, unparalleled cuisine beyond relatable four and five Michelin star experiences abroad.
Megan M.}Eglin Air Force Base, FL}183}4}3}-1}5}6/1/2016}Amazing place. So underground with a "cool" low-key vibe. Sashimi was great, as well as, the pork belly. My boyfriend said the miso clam soup was the best miso soup he's ever had.
Cameron H.}Los Angeles, CA}58}4}0}-1}3}5/29/2016}Food was delicious but stupid expensive. Dinner for one cost me $135 and my waiter kept pressuring me to order more food.
Josh R.}Forest Hills, NY}4}8}3}-1}5}5/28/2016}If the best parts of Japan were crammed on a flight to New York, Sakagura would be the airline. Don't know if that was the best way to compare them.With an amazing menu and a sake bar of +250 selections, Sakagura deserves these 5 stars.Sakagura introduced me to Japanese delicacies like Natto, buta pork braised like heaven, and many more that were hidden inside the big menu but stood out on the table.Everything that does not always taste amazing like Natto is transformed into something appealing. I don't know how they do it but I do know that this one is a keeper and I will be coming back. (I have already been twice)
Michael O.}Manhattan, NY}175}13}8}-1}4}5/25/2016}This place is super cool for dinner or a date...Simply because it's hidden. You have to go through an office building then down really ghetto stairs only to enter a utopia like Japanese restaurant. Very authentic in the look and menu. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the food is okay not great however it's not that expensive. Definitely worth going for the experience.
Mi Rae C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}46}353}1333}18}4}5/24/2016}Cavernous secret place for sake and Japanese dishes.  Not really a sushi place but they have other raw and grilled dishes.  Their sake selection is the most extensive that I have ever seen.
Landon C.}Boston, MA}89}115}181}-1}5}5/24/2016}I was recently in NY for work and decided to Yelp for some good Japanese. I found this place and thought I'd give it a shot. Trying to find t is definitely a challenge. It helps if you start on the right street - me being an idiot was the first problem.Once I figured out I was on the right street, you have to go to the lobby of the office building, sign in, and go down stairwell F. Once you get down there, it's unmistakable as a little gem hidden in the city.The decor is great as well as the general vibe. I sat by myself at the bar and started it with some rich sake (sorry no idea which one). I ordered the tuna tartare which was fantastic. Lots of nice tuna flavor with some refreshing tastes mixed in sitting on cucumber. I also ordered the ribeye skillet with sprouts - flavor was much better than anticipated.  Superb full flavored beef cooked perfectly.For dessert I had the sake red bean bun with a side of green tea sorbet. As someone without a big sweet tooth, this was great for a portion of sweet and then refreshing sorbet to kind of clean the palate. Definitely will come again with friends when I'm not being a loser sitting by myself checking my phone.
Anthony B.}New York, NY}4}14}0}-1}5}5/23/2016}Food is always delicious and the service is very polite and helpful. Will definitely go back to Sakagura many times!
Lem Z.}Farnborough, United Kingdom}38}2}1}-1}4}5/22/2016}Dishes were excellently prepared and tasty. Had the tofu salad, inaniwa udon and the beef. Delish!!!  Reasonably priced with a great lunch menu and slightly fewer options for dinnertime. Would definitely come back again.
Jessica Q.}Queens, NY}69}6}1}-1}4}5/21/2016}Very cozy and comfortable place. The food is not amazing, but good enough for me to come back to this place. I love the style of the decoration. It was lunchtime when I went there so it get a bit crowded. But everything else is decent. Will recommend this place to my friends.
Katrina L.}Manhattan, NY}175}378}98}-1}5}5/20/2016}Venue - Lovely restaurant In the basement of an office building. To get there, go to the end of the elevators and there's a door on the lefthand side that leads downstairs to the restaurant.Food - Various small Japanese plates to share. Everything is good. The beef tongue was huge. I'm used to trying thin slices, but this was a whole piece. Don't order it if you're squeamish about it. I also enjoyed the grilled rice balls, which had nice flavor. Service - Exceptional. Out waiter was super attentive, from refilling water and sake to tidying up our napkins, he also made sure to mention what to expect for the mountain yam since many are surprised it comes in a slimy form.
Dianna L.}Tottenville, NY}122}11}8}-1}5}5/19/2016}I brought my boyfriend here to spoil him for his birthday. I wanted to treat him to something special and new and was worried that this would be one of those over-rated not-so-special places. I have never been so glad to have something exceed my expectations. It was busy, I made a reservation for 8:30 and was seated fairly around that time. We tried the special - washy beef on stone - so. Good. The whole meal was seriously like an adventure - the dishes were definitely good quality and prepared well but she. You try it with the sides/toppings/dips that come with it, it's a whole new world as well.Definitely enjoyed the night and the wonderful food and courteous wait staff and kind front desk people. So worth the money I spent and these 5 stars! :)
Celine N.}Geneva, Switzerland}116}92}149}-1}5}5/18/2016}Sakagura is one of my favorite Japanese spots in the area. Super authentic and fresh all the time. This is a popular lunchtime spot so make sure that you make a reservation. My favorite things to order:Ten Don Set- shrimp tempura over rice and a side of soba. You may need a nap afterwards but it's worth the food coma.Sake Tekka Half Don - fresh salmon, tuna sashimi and salmon roe over rice. Just the good stuff! So delicious.At night, Sakagura is also great for sake enthusiasts. They have an extensive selection and the atmosphere is on point.
Mike O.}Pennington, NJ}472}330}2575}18}5}5/18/2016}For the discerning. For the expert. For the aficionado. For the gourmand. Not to be missed. I arrived quite early for lunch today which explains why I was able to secure a seat at the tiny bar (with a single chef) for this wondrous luncheon. The arrival is zen-like. Everything in here is positioned exactly as desired. Every napkin every chopsticks set. Behind the bar as well. The pride shown here is life-changing. Every filet is exactly placed and wrapped. Now I'm ready for the deliciousness to begin...I see the laminated menu with pictures, colored-font specials and prices, discounts and more. Hmmm. This doesn't seem to be the menu for the room I'm in. I ask the server is there a chef's choice? She smiles, deeply appreciative of my invitation. "Yes!" she says. Omakase is served with pleasure!!I'm about to have a one-piece-at-a-time pleasure feast presented by this master chef. None of the foofy show of movementHuge pile of gari for palate cleansing in between coursesserved also with pickled lotus root. Wow. Awesome textures!Omakase nigiri sushi lunch. +Started with a bowl of miso. The scallions are so cold! Nice saltiness to the onion. How did you do that?! They are somehow instantly cut from a few seconds ago!+Jack fish+Salmon+++ 5 year old snapper. I don't know how it's possible but it is smoky and fluffy like a cloud. Amazing. +++ Fresh water eel hand roll. Deliciously hot eel simply with a dry and smoky wrapper and rice. Two perfect bites. +++ Toro. Generous, perfect temperature and devoured instantly. ++ Ama Ebi head (1 bite) of perfectly prepared tempura. Perfect flavoring. +++ Ama Ebi shrimp body. Again with the essence of cloud. How are these shrimp so perfect? Are they raised in a shrimp spa?!+++ Yellowtail. It's fatty and oily. Perfection. I can feel the cut of the knife blade on the meat. Wow. (Ghost?) mackerel. Not sure the type of mackerel but it is more chewy than other mackerel I've had. So interesting the FLAVORS!+ Sea urchin nigiri. Of all the courses it's my least favorite. But least favorite of life-changing sushi is just a bit of perfection instead of lots! But how can you criticize perfection?! There are hundreds of uni possibilities, hundreds of profiles, hundreds of textures. This one was only excellent. Lol.  (You know I gotta find at least one thing to kvetch about!)+++ ("Ambajaque")? Never had this one before. But it's going straight on a theme of deliciously chewier!+++ salmon roe. Wow. With drops of, was that, wine??!!! Wowowow!!!+++++ finishing with the best, a smoked and roasted toro. Not seared but flamed, this presentation is definitely worthy of my top-5-meal list. By final request I take one tamago and it does not disappoint! Surrounding the rice it is perfect!!Definitely coming back!!!
June S.}New York, NY}154}456}3030}18}3}5/10/2016}I am always looking for a "hidden" restaurant in NYC (or anywhere for that matter). When I found this place, I was very excited to visit them. When you get to the building, you will find a staircase door, specifically for Sakagura. They had a sample of today's Lunch Special and pattisier's recommended dessert at the front door. It is always good to be able to see what the food REALLY looks like before you order them. The moment you step into the front door, you are transported into a restaurant in Japan. It is so cool, every inch was decorated perfectly!Even though there is no window, they had plenty of lighting to keep this place bright, some lighting resembles windows or old-fashioned window fixture of old Japanese houses, so you almost forget that it is in a basement.We ordered the Lunch Special of the day, and Jello-Sake by Ikezo. I love this drink! The service was good at the beginning, but after our food was brought to the table, I felt like the waitress completely forgotten about us. The restaurant was packed, and she was going around all the tables around us, but never came to check on us, at all. We had to try to get someone's attention, any one who would look at us, just to get a dessert menu. After we looked at yummy options, no one came to see if we wanted to order a dessert. After a while, we decided we would just pay and go. That took a while too, as we had to catch someone to get our bill for us. So, the service basically went from 100% to 0% very quickly.The food and drink was great. I would go back for some more lunch special. I just have to be prepared for another possible bad service (or no service). The staff were all very nice, but they do need to be able to pay attention to all of their tables and customers a bit better.
Paul S.}New York, NY}121}78}1195}18}3}5/9/2016}Transport yourself to Tokyo is their tagline. This hidden restaurant has a lot of pluses. In Midtown, it is difficult to find good food option and the team at Sakagura has a pretty great spot if you can find it. My review is overall very positive but I am giving this place a 3 because of spotty service.First off, check out my photos or follow other yelpers instructions but you will be entering an standard office building. Ask at the front desk and they will direct you to staircase F near the elevator bank. Take the stair down and you are not going to the basement to be killed but going to be "Transported to Tokyo." For the space and decor, there are a lot of authentic and classic Japanese touches. It is a pretty large restaurant. We arrived when they opened and it filled up with a short period after they opened.We came for lunch. They have a daly lunch special which is definitely hard to get because they only make a small amount. It is worth to ask for it if you arrive early.Our meal was Takana Mentai Don, Spicy Codfish Roe, Whitebait and Takana Leave over rice with Soba Noodles on the side ($11.50). We had Ikezo Peach Jelly Sparkling Sake. The service from the wait staff became worse as the meal progressed. We were interested in a dessert but the waitress did not come back in time for us to order.  Overall, I would be interested to come back for more lunch specials and try their wide variety of Sake.
Lucas R.}New York, NY}1}12}0}-1}2}5/7/2016}Stars for customer service. Got charged for an item we did not receive, so we called later in the night and the manager believed us. Maybe the dish was delivered to the wrong table and someone else eat it, but their politeness and respect to the customer got them the stars.--The food was 1 star. Nothing special, nothing stands out. You might like it if you don't often eat Asian food or understand it, or don't appreciate food in general. However, for everyone else, there is nothing special at this place, yet another Japanese place living off the hype and smoking weed. Everyone at my 6-people party agreed.
anabela D.}Queens, NY}12}157}0}-1}2}5/6/2016}best thing IMO about this place is physical space and thousand of sake options as well as sake flights. There seem to be alot of Japanese restaurants on this block of the city.Having never been to Japan it's what you see advertised in travel shows as a very typical Japanese local  restaurant . It was not so secret and not so hard to find- staircase down is marked.But it was not appetizing going into cellar looking stairs. Anyways when we got there place fairly empty as we were shooting for early dinner at 6 pm. Space got very packed and loud by the time we left at 8:45. Service was adequate. Speedy at first but as space got busy sloooow. We had to ask 3 times for our final menu options. I thought serving sizes adequate and pricing for Japanese ok. Meal with my $30 sake flight was $100 and I was satisfied.We got five dishes for 2 :signature braised pork belly, tofu salad, salmon chirashi with salmon caviar, fried shrimp rolls, and seared cubed rib eye beef. My favorite was tofu salad and chirashi. simple but salmon sushi was warm and not ultra fresh.We should have gotten $38 deep fried sea bream special which we spied at the table next door which looked yummy. Overall no exciting tastes combo. Everything one note.Very disappointed with pork belly. Overly sweet and fat not rendered. I tried dry sake flight $30 which did not have a lot of taste variation between the types and for $30  not one was spectacular or very good. Tasted like the cheap $5 sake you can always get anywhere. Though I am not a sake expert.Overall would not recommend and try some of the other Japanese options on the block.
Sue Y.}Bethesda, MD}14}3}0}-1}5}5/4/2016}Awesome place. Black cod (appetizer)is heavenly. Everything else is also great, including sake. Can be a bit slow at dinner time coz it's always crowded.
Pei-Hsin L.}Manhattan, NY}158}13}272}-1}5}5/1/2016}After visiting Sakagura several times I've decided they're pretty great. This time I managed to mess up our Open Table reservation (off by one, derp...), but the host handled it with grace and seated us as soon as possible. Because of the situation we were seated at the bar, but that turned out swimmingly since we made friends with the sake sommelier. He didn't identify himself as such until I asked him outright, but he was so knowledgable that it was impossible not to notice. Sakagi-san made a few recommendations based on my affinity for rieslings and let me taste a couple before choosing the peachy smooth Denshin Haru Junmai Ginjo Muroka Nama (available in limited quantities this spring). It's such a joy to find new treats with expert help - precisely the sort of experience that brings me back for more.For food this time we tried the atsuyaki tamago (eel omelet), tori tsukune (chicken meat balls), buta kakuni (pork belly), and kani donebe meshi (snow crab rice). They were all quite nice but the only one I'd order again is the buta kakuni. (This is not to say that the others aren't worth ordering at all; I just like to try new things!)Last but not least, Sakagura really does dessert well. I LOVE dessert, so this is like an expressway to my heart. We tried to order the apricot panna cotta, but they were out and Plan B was the black sesame creme brûlée. That's pretty much my favorite dessert in the city, so no complaints here. I also have a really lovely memory of sharing one with my father last Father's Day, so that doesn't hurt!!!
Peter W.}West Windsor Township, NJ}7}13}0}-1}4}4/28/2016}Uzaku is awesome. The best dish I had in Sakagura. Buta Kakuni is not as good as expected. This place is very well decorated. Very good service. It's very popular, hard to get a reservation, but personally like Aburiya Kinnosuke better.
Eunice N.}Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY}32}48}69}-1}3}4/27/2016}food's great, decor is lovely, attentive service. with that being said, here is why I'll probably not come back:-not a big eater but even for me the portions were incredibly small. well aware that this place is upscale but I can't swallow how small and pricey each plate was -service was overly attentive. really hate answering the servers mid-bite.... .. . like yeah im enjoying my food, that's why it's falling out of my mouth as I take a huge bite into it. leave me alone !!! -felt like I was walking into a hidden cave...place was down a basement. if I weren't taken here by a friend id have given up and ate at Luke's lobster next door. overall, decent place but would skip if in the area
Taiyo O.}New York, NY}913}583}1063}18}4}4/27/2016}This review is only to what I picked up, KatsuSando. Authentically packaged but not showing what I would get was peculiar at first. But there was not so attractive and small photo attaching to its shelve. What I like about TonKatsu (Japanese pork cutlet) sandwich has been the "thick cut" of lean meat. Meat taste better cut think, that is obviously, if the quality of meat is solid. It is also one of my husband's favorite Japanese foods, so I got one for him.This sandwich was tightly sealed in a plastic wrap, and naturally I worried. The sandwich might had gotten soggy, and it was. But seeing the traditionally thick-cut meat that were sandwiched between soft-chewy Japanese white bread, relieved me. But after one bite, I noticed something I was not used to...but I kept eating. It was the sauce. Instead of thick sweet Tonkatsu sauce, it was a house special sauce, a mixture of Japanese BBQ sauce and miso. Miso created unique saltiness to the sauce. After I finished half of soggy sandwich, I was unstoppable and made me want to go back for more. The location is tricky as most mentioned here. Think you are going into the high rise office building with doormen. The lobby is covered by white marble(?), like a gallery. The tiny store is located way back by the elevators on the grand floor. I chatted with only staff, Japanese, to get more info on this place. Their bentos are freshly made every day at the Japanese restaurant Sakagura in the basement of the building.
Jun D.}Manhattan, NY}1}23}3}-1}4}4/20/2016}The Food: pretty good authentic-ish Japanese cuisine. The Place: pretty cool atmosphere, feels like you are in a cave back in 18th century Japan.
Anthony T.}Brooklyn, NY}21}27}28}-1}5}4/18/2016}One of the best Japanese Places in NYC that I have had. This is a very hidden restaurant... the basement of a High Rise building... without looking out for it... you would definitely miss it. I would not lie... the prices are high here, so definitely expect to spend a little bit on your meal.. but I haven't had anything here that tasted anything less than great. I will say that I have yet to try the whole menu... but there are some key items that I really love.The serving sizes for the dishes are actually quite small. If you are sharing.. you probably would need to split at least 3-4 dishes between two people. But I find it always a good idea so you are able to try more items on the menu without spending on one item and not really caring for it.The main thing that I go back for every time i return to Sakagura is the Braised Pork Belly (Buta no Kakuni). Pork belly is of course known to be very fatty.. but eating this dish.. you don't feel disgusting nor does it really leave an oily feeling in your mouth. Instead you are greeted by the nice mild tastes and aromas of the broth and the melt-in-your-mouth texture of the pork.Another must have during the visit is the Salmon Sashimi and Roe over rice. I'm not crazy about Roe.. mainly because when you get it outside.. it seem to hold a very fishy flavor. But Sakagura must use some very fresh fish and Roe because eating it with the rice, you don't taste any of the fishiness that Roe sometimes comes with at all. Of course that is to say that you should finish eating this dish first before the Roe heats up from the rice.The desserts are also very delicious with the simple Asian flavored ice cream to their really delicious Sesame Flavored Creme Brulee. Definitely try that out if you enjoy the different Asian dessert flavors.The end point.. this place has yet to disappoint me... the dishes that I've had up to this point is phenomenal and nothing less than delicious. But it is only what I can vouche for.Definitely make a reservation here... because it gets packed FAST.
Jenny W.}New York, NY}34}5}8}-1}4}4/15/2016}Great Japanese food! Definitely coming back. Gotta try more sake.Great Japanese food! Definitely coming back. Gotta try more sake.Great Japanese food!

Shin O.}Manhattan, NY}52}47}13}-1}4}4/14/2016}This izakaya is in hidden place, but it was crowded when we visited!! We enjoyed various kinds of raw fish and Japanese sake on the excellent counter seat. It has a so fancy interior decoration that I felt like I was in Japan. Especially, I was surprised that its restroom was in a big barrel. Also, It had one of the widest selection of Japanese sake in Midtown. My coworker treated me on that day, so I don't know its price, but it is suitable for business dinner.
Jeffery H.}Aliso Viejo, CA}0}23}3}-1}3}4/9/2016}I came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night around 9. We didn't have a reservation but the wait time was only about 25 minutes. We really enjoyed the food but the service was pretty awful. The service was slow in general which would have been okay, until at one point they brought us the wrong dish. Once we sent it back we waited about 40 mins for it to be corrected, without an apology or explanation. They made no effort to correct the situation and were not polite when we asked about where our food was.
Michael T.}Charleston, SC}103}620}5}-1}4}4/9/2016}Amazing Japanese restaurant! Hidden in the basement of a midtown office building. Nondescript door sign. You would never find this place without a friend to hook you up. It has the usual elements - friendly staff, hip vibe, high quality cuisine and really fun. We ordered everything - Sashimi, daikon salad, agedashi tofu, fried chicken, fried shrimp rolls, chicken meatballs, black cod soy sauce, wagu beef, plus some more that I can't remember! It's authentic and amazing! Overall outstanding!
Mark K.}Venice, CA}6}6}0}-1}1}4/8/2016}This restaurant is not open late. Only the bar is. The Yelp site claims they are open until 1 a.m. We arrived at 11:25 pm, more than 90 minutes before, and they refused to serve us, claiming that the kitchen had already closed. When I showed them the Yelp site they denied responsibility for it. Even when I showed them their OWN site which says the take orders until 11:45 pm (twenty minutes after our arrival), they said that was for "drinks and desserts" only (which is of course nowhere on their site. )Arrogant and uncaring customer "service".  I won't bother trying to eat there again
Erik D.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}0}-1}4}3/30/2016}Sakagura's sake selection was on point. First time finding the place can be a little confusing, but once you get there it has a really cool atmosphere. The food is really good, but if you've experienced authentic Japanese food before, the price they ask for is a little much.
Jasmine S.}Arlington, VA}8}13}9}-1}5}3/27/2016Updatedreview}Nice service and fruit wine! We're satisfied with Everything we ordered. It was a memorable experience and miss the lovely place a lot. (It's a review draft from months ago)
Stephanie L.}New York, NY}486}126}494}18}5}3/27/2016}Firsst of all, for those of you who are LOST, Sakagura is indeed at 211 E 43rd Street. You go into the bright white office building, tell the front desk you're here to eat at Sakagura, and then they'll tell you to go down Staircase F. Quite secretive, but you'll be surprised after you walk down a sketchy staircase to see a beautifully decorated restaurant waiting for you. Although I feel like the staff could be a bit warmer, Sakagura was overall a cozy and comfortable Japanese restaurant to eat at. I would love to come here more often, but it's a bit pricey. But I promise you get what you pay for. The dishes/portions are kind of small. So if you go with a big group of people, you gotta order extra of each dish so everyone could get at least a bite. I suggest to order a lot of different things so you can try everything, and then order more of the dish you enjoy the most (but you might be full by the time you're done). Here are the dishes that I have eaten (It's still growing):Hirame Ponzu - Fish was fresh and it had a good amount of acidity.Uni Ikura Onsen Tomago - Beautiful. I ate it so fast. Try eating it with rice; it's a good combo.Agedashi Tofu - It was ok. Nothing special.Nasu Dengaku - Three kinds of eggplant, and all three of them are delicious. Gindara Yuan Yaki - I feel like black cod is such a classic fish to get at a Japanese restaurant, at ths black cod here does that disappoint! I just wish it was bigger.Jidori Shioyaki - Probably my FAVORITE thing on the entire menu. The chicken is so juicy and the sauce it comes with makes it even better. MUST GET.Buta Kakuni - It says signature dish, but I must regretfully say that it wasn't all that.Chawanmushi - Nice egg custard. I feel like it could be more flavorful. Miso Yakionigiri - It was unfortunately really plain. The miso was not really infused, it's just centered in the middle of the onigiri and it wasn't a lot. I like the crispiness of the grilled rice though.Sake - Honestly, all the ones I had were pretty good and paired up well with the food. P.S: The bathroom is so nice!
Melissa S.}New York, NY}3}19}8}-1}5}3/24/2016}Legit one of the best meals or my life! I had the tuna sashimi with grated yam, cold soba, tofu and black sesame creme brûlée. All AMAZING. And of course the sake selection is top notch. I had Onikoroshi, a Kyoto sake, Fukuoka sake and one other.. Ha i can't remember!
Alexa T.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}0}17}7}-1}5}3/24/2016}This place is a MUST visit ! everything was great - and food and service ! Probably the best UNi i ever had ( and its  usually hard to find fresh uni ), pork belly was fantastic too!400$ bill though ;-))) be ready ))
Vipul P.}Manhattan, NY}19}8}0}-1}2}3/24/2016}To start, this has been my favorite restaurant for last 6 years. I refer all my friends to this place as I truly believe this is a gem and amazing food. Until today, the creme brulee which is my fav dessert in the city was really bad. Complained to the manager and they gave me a 10% discount on the dish. Even if they would have taken it off the check I would have paid for what I consumed, but don't think I will be coming back. Bad bad service.
Catherine Y.}New York, NY}236}51}176}-1}4}3/24/2016}Best agedashi ever!! Karaage is either a hit or a miss, but when it is a hit, it is the most juicy and tender piece of light, crispy fried chicken. Drooling just thinking about it
Britta B.}Easton, PA}1}33}3}-1}2}3/23/2016}Atmosphere: Awesome, one of the main reasons this isn't 1 star. It is a place new york where you just have to know how to get there. Through a pure white building, down a flight of stairs, into what has to be the coolest mix of Asian decorations I have ever seen. Food (Dinner)-Appetizer: In my group of three people we decided it would be good to get the Santen-mori, which is just an appetizer assortment. I picked the AMAEBI SHUTOUAE which is sweet shrimp, my boyfriend chose the IKA SHIOKARA which was raw eel and his father ordered the KISHU UMEBOSHI the sweet plum. When it first came out we were in awe. The waitress said the portion sizes were 'small' but it was unrealistic tiny. I did not like any of the three things we ordered, both the taste and the texture were not good. My boyfriend enjoyed the plum, his father tolerated it. The way the food looked was gross, 'baby vomit' was the term used. The plating was nice, but overall not something I would ever order again.Dinner: The group decided to each order a dish or two and share it. Being weary of trying new places I wanted to order the simplest meal which was the CHIKUZEN NI. The veggies were very bland and the chicken was the size of a golf ball buried underneath. I know the dish was only 7$ (one of the cheapest things on the menu) but a little flavor or a nicer presentation would have been nice. My boyfriend wanted to try the special which wasn't on the menu. It was basically fish with some sort of weird grated something on the side (which of course I thought was rice, bit in and tasted toilet cleaner like) The fish was OK. Nothing fancy, or amazing. He also tried the pork belly which he said was tasty, just a lot of fat. We decided to share two rice balls seeing how everyone seemed to enjoy them, but they were so bland! The fish was fresh, but taste wise it wasn't really something to write home about. I had better ones at the local bento place! I guess for the 'price' compared to everything else they were worth it. His father ordered the eggplant which he said was tasty, at least his favorite dish but nothing amazing. He also ordered the deep fried shrimp rolls and 'hush puppies' or JAGAIMO DANGO on the menu. Those were very plain, and the matcha salt was pretty but just tasted like salt. Actually preferred it without the salt. Overall not very tasty, pretty plain, nothing really to write home about. It wasn't 'bad', maybe we ordered the wrong things? Server: was friendly but messed up my order once (which wasn't a big deal they fixed it). Being busy was not helpful, we spent at least ten+ minutes waiting just to get drinks then another 10+ to place appetizers. Finally she came back just long enough to answer any questions before running off. She really did not check up on us very often. The place was busy but not very large. She was very nice and everyone spoke English fluent.  Maybe one day when I am old enough to drink I will come back to try the Sake with lunch but this time left me with a pretty poor impression.
Michael C.}ASTORIA, NY}1}27}0}-1}4}3/23/2016}I really enjoyed this very authentic Japanese experience. If you are an adventurous eater and like trying interesting things this is the place for you. Also if you are very into SAKI, consider this a 5 star review. The food itself was delicious. I made the mistake of ordering a couple things more adventurous than my pallet allowed but that was my fault not theirs. Be aware that this is essential a tapas style restaurant with their small dishes. They are priced accordingly so I was happy. I recommend the pork belly which had amazing flavor. The only reason i am going with a 4 star is that the service and timing of the food was a little off, things got forgotten and there was some communication issues with getting them to explain a couple menu items we wanted to try. These issues were out shined by how good the food was so i still highly recommend it.
Jan A.}Chicago, IL}0}36}45}-1}5}3/23/2016}We had amazing experience in may '16. One of the best Japanese foods I've ever had. We tried many things from the menu, also sakes. It was all delish! Try fermented soybeans, if you have never had them. One other awesome thing: we had an infant with us, like 5 months old baby. And they accommodated us no problems! They even took care of the folded stroller. This was a sign of excellent customer service for me!

Belinda C.}New York, NY}412}80}140}-1}4}3/11/2016}This is a hidden little secret restaurant UNDER my office!!! I was looking for a decent Japanese spot to eat with my coworkers since I was craving sushi, and we circled around the blocks until we settled on this restaurant that just happened to be right in our building, tucked away in the basement! We didn't have to wait very long when we arrived at 1:30ish to be seated. I really wanted the chirashi bowl lunch, but the menu was pretty deceiving, saying that the specials were starting the next week (when we received our check, we saw lunch specials WITH the chirashi bowl option.....).I settled with the sake tekka half don, which consisted of salmon, tuna, and salmon roe over rice. It was pretty good, but I still wish I had the option to choose the chirashi bowl lunch! I liked that it came with miso soup, which was a pleasant surprise, and it was surprisingly realllly concentrated, different from any other miso soup I've had in other restaurants.Would probably come back here again, and hopefully they'll show the lunch special options next time!
Erika M.}Manhattan, NY}1}13}9}-1}4}3/10/2016}My boyfriend loves a fried chicken at sakagura!!Ikura oroshi and sea-uchin taste so good.They have many sake collections too.. It's not too expensive and very cozy. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Trinh And Laurie L.}Brooklyn, NY}46}127}216}-1}5}3/8/2016}Everything here is perfect from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave with the happy belly. The first time you enter is a real nice experience as the speakeasy leaves you speechless. The decor and the bar are both very beautiful. This is a perfect place for an intimate dinner. The food is yummy and everything we tried was amazing.
Kathia B.}Bridgeport, CT}26}153}256}18}5}3/6/2016}A friend recommended this place and I am so glad she did. I was staying at a hotel on park Ave yelping a place for a romantic dinner when I realized I bookmarked this place months ago. It's kind of hidden and if you're really not focusing on trying to find the sign to this place, you'll never get in. Everything was flavorful yet simple. The rice doughnuts were fun and savory. All the fish was super fresh. However I was blow away by the black sesame creme brûlée. I was licking the plate.
Safina Z.}Los Angeles, CA}114}53}0}-1}3}3/5/2016}A cute place. We went there on a thanksgiving day after a whole day shopping...I remembered I had daikon&octopus stew and some sashimi. They were decently cooked and quite tasty.
Esther P.}Bronx, NY}3}71}0}-1}4}3/1/2016}Went for a friend's birthday~ just the two of us... called to reserve on a Friday night for Saturday night... and still managed to snag a 7.15PM reservation for the counter... not bad. Good service on the phone.. said they would try to find us a table if possible and they delivered! Food: 3.9Service: 4.5Ambiance: 3.9The place looked very cute. I like that it is not too large of a venue... sometimes the grandness of a restaurant takes away from its charm... The food was a little pricey... but I am biased because I am not a sushi lover. My friend loves sushi and she was happy... but we were both starving... so I don't know how much you want to trust our opinions  (; But the service was great... they took really good care of us... helped us pick out a hot sake which we BOTH very much enjoyed!  (=
Lori G.}Minneapolis, MN}8}108}0}-1}5}2/29/2016}consider the price, the quality, and the location, definitely top on my list! I usually order five to six "small plates" to share between two. Recommend to always make a reservation otherwise you can wait for a long time.
Gerald S.}New York, NY}0}7}1}-1}5}2/26/2016}Top notch, top taste, top service. I love this place for both food and variety of libations. Can't go wrong. You get what you pay for.
Rose K.}New York, NY}387}416}515}18}4}2/26/2016}Finally, the elusive Sakagura reservation. It feels like a well-kept secret (in the basement of the United Nations building) but it's always packed! We arrived right when they opened for dinner, and we were seated at the bar. The waitstaff was kind and knowledgeable if not all that available. The waitress helped us pick out a fabulous bottle of cold sake. If you see the big wall of sake, you'll know whey you have to order it here. The presentation is beautiful- a bucket of ice with lovely flowers arranged in the ice. We ordered the Miyazakigyu Ishiyaki, the Miyazaki beef grilled on a hot stone. The beef quality was phenomenal. The seared washu gyu beef (served cold) was also delicious. We were big fans of the hot toasted onigiri, and the soy cod. The tuna tartare presentation was impeccable, and tasted just as good. The entire experience here was great. Just casual enough to feel comfortable and intimate enough to be an excellent date night out.
Jarrod C.}Jacksonville Beach, FL}15}23}4}-1}4}2/21/2016}Always a pleasure to come here, Sakagura's a true recreation of pub dining in Tokyo (from my limited experience with the authentic latter).  They don't do any nigiri, only sashimi, but feature a slew of physically beautiful expressions of genuine Japanese cuisine on small plates that you really should order and share as a table to get the most possible diversity.  Branch out and try something outside your comfort zone; how often do you even have such opportunity?No doubt mentioned countless times before here, but the cold eel and cucumber salad appetizer's marvellously pretty to both palate and retina.Cod appetizer's small and supple.  The staff's seemed quite knowledgeable of sake every time I've come.  It is more expensive than the Japanese+Manhattan norms by a good measure, not quite Nobu costly but not far off, but given how sincere it is in Japanese spirit I'd not recommend anything else for a visitor to NYC wanting to dine Japanese in Manhattan.
Will B.}New York, NY}0}20}0}-1}4}2/18/2016}Delicious traditional Japanese food (not to be mistaken with sushi). One of the best sake bars in town. Hard to find if you don't know where it is but getting in without reservations is impossible.
Will S.}Chicago, IL}0}501}1}-1}4}2/14/2016}S Service was H ----------Returned 2/11/16Return? Absolutely. Great food, fun environmentAtmosphere (4) Funny location - you walk through a nondescript office building, down the maintenance stairwell to the basement, through cement floor hallway into a waiting area with ugly brown curtains that look as if they cut from a college couch covering, Once through the curtains you enter a very cool Japanese tiki bar/restaurant. We sat at the bar. Not loud at all, easy to carry on a conversation, and plenty of elbow room. We stay fo 2.5 hrs and were never rushed. In sum very comfortable, pleasantFood (1) - Sashimi is top notch (they don't serve sushi). We had our server select an assortment of tuna, salmon and others. Also got the rib roast and chicken but both were way too fatty for my taste. My brother picked up the tab. Had a carafe of hot sake and two glasses of beers apiece (approx 8-10 oz glass).Service (2) - Friendly but wasn't used to picking dishes on our behalf (wanted us to choose from menu).   Cost = My brother picked up the tab so don't know cost. On a subsequent visit my tab before tax/tip was $117.30 for the Sashimi plate ($71 for 5 pieces, $55 if only get 4 - liked everything but the urchin which had soft texture and not very good tatse), 2 beers, white rice ($2), seaweed salad ($10), and carafe of saki ($20 for about two wine glasses worth)
Ben C.}Elmhurst, NY}63}34}38}-1}4}2/10/2016}We were there on Valentine's Day and for this place reservation is recommended. We had many dishes. The best of all was the oyster dish. All dishes were small so if you go there hungry like us you would probably end up at $120 per person. The Uni with soba was good as well and nice selection of sake
Charlene W.}Des Moines, WA}44}19}41}-1}4}2/10/2016}I sat at the bar and welcomed by friendly, informed and attentive staff. Very nice sake selection, which the server assisted me with in choosing a complementary pairing for the salmon kama and uni soba noodles. The salmon was oh so fresh and delicious. The uni, from Santa Barbara, sweet, nutty and beautiful with the house made soba. Highly recommend for business travelers and locals. Can be difficult to find (in the basement of an office building). Do make a reservation if you can.
Olga C.}Alexandria, VA}0}14}1}-1}5}1/29/2016}This is my favorite Japanese (or maybe even overall!) restaurant in New York City. It's like going to Japan! The sake selection is amazing. Their food was great too. We ordered a lot of small dishes and it's hard for me to say which one was the best. The mashed potato croquettes - like savory doughnuts with potatoes inside. Ridiculously good! So were the seafood croquettes encrusted with almonds. The steamed poached eggs in dashi were delicious as well. My favorite dessert was probably the black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream. Delicious! Call to make reservations. It's definitely worth it!
Jay I.}New York, NY}238}666}157}18}4}1/28/2016}4.5 starsOne of my friends strongly recommended this place, saying the whole experience was great.  I decided to try this place.  It is on 43th st and 3rd ave.  You go into a regular nyc residential building passing the small sign of the restaurant.  The security guy will let you know how to get to the restaurant, but basically you keep walking until you see "F" stair, then go down a floor.  Then you will find a restaurant that looks like a regular Japanese eatery.Menu was mostly composed of small dishes to share, then had some other dishes for yourself.  We decided to share bunch of dishes and share.  I especially liked friend pork, mashed potato donut and soy sauce based beef tongue.  Onigiri (rice balls) put a nice finish to our entree meal.  We got black sesame cream brulee for dessert.  I thought I really enjoyed my whole experience from beginning to the end.  Will definitely stop by again.
Caryn C.}Lindenhurst, NY}893}266}110}-1}5}1/27/2016}I really enjoyed my experience here! Got the daikon salad! Definitely a nice way to start out but couldnt eat too much of it. I would like to first apologize that I dont remember the names of the dishes that I tried but I can describe them.  I am going to highlight only the items that I truly enjoyedWe had the crab rice, which takes 45 minutes to make so as soon we sat down we ordered it! We had this item which was like fried chicken but tasted... classier? It didnt make me feel heavy with oil after. Then finally we had the creme brulee, you can taste that everything was freshly made. Amazing experience here! Yall must go!
Rebeca V.}Miami, FL}535}99}1036}18}4}1/22/2016Updatedreview}My local favorite hidden gem is definitely Sakagura. Every time I come here I love it more and more. Brought my brother and his girlfriend here to try some authentic Japanese food ( no sushi) . Tapas Style. We ordered seaweed salad with the sesame dressing ( one order for myself can't get enough) , the black cod ( to die) , the stewed pork belly ( very rich) the fried chicken ( good but not into fried food) and the egg custard.. Ehh wouldn't get that again. We drank my favorite sake that tastes so smooth almost like a Pinot Grigio. Recommend this place to anyone who wants a real gem!
Vania S.}New York, NY}339}21}14}-1}4}1/15/2016}Yum!!! Came here for lunch one day with my coworkers at around 12:30pm with no reservation and we waited around 15-20 minutes for our table. Unfortunately, the lunch special was already out, but I ordered the Sake Ikura Don Set (salmon sashimi and roe) with the cold soba noodles and it was incredibly satisfying. Definitely coming back here- their menu looks extensive!
Helen P.}San Francisco, CA}84}184}766}18}4}1/14/2016}I came here last June with some friends for a late dinner/drinks and was very pleased with everything. The restaurant was a little hard to find but that wasn't a big issue. The menu is different from other Japanese restaurants that I've been to because it consists mostly of cold/hot small dishes, kind of like a tapas restaurant. We ordered sliced squid cured in salt and marinade, Sake Oyako Don (sliced salmon and roe on rice), Saikoro Steak, large grilled oysters, and two bottles of sake. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're starving, but it's definitely somewhere I would go for a light meal or snack and drinks.
Ken M.}Brooklyn, NY}15}73}19}-1}5}1/6/2016}Went here on a date a few weeks ago. Arrived without a reservation on a Saturday night and luckily got seated within about 45 minutes. The location is under an office building (which reminded me of many places I ate at in Japan). The layout of the restaurant is awesome and the gigantic bar is great. Their menu was very unique, not really a sushi type place (they did have sashimi and similar items). I'd say it is more of a Japanese tapas bar, although they had some larger entrees as well. There were a ton of really cool dishes I had never really heard of or tried before. Their Sake list was nearly endless. Prices are not that bad for the amazing quality you get. Fantastic place to experience if you are cool with trying a lot of different things. One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in NYC.
H.S K.}Bronx, NY}79}12}20}-1}5}1/4/2016}My friend brought me here for some drinks of sake, but this place was a bit hard to find. It's inside on the basement floor of a commercial building. Moreover, no service....! If your looking for a place where you can enjoy food WITHOUT your phone ringing every 5 minutes, this place is gold!! They have a very wild range of sake! If you're lost, ask for help! The servers and sommeliers were very helpful in helping our selection of sake. The food was very good! Small plates and appetizers goes perfectly with the drink if your not too hungry. They are all nicely arranged too!! Definitely recommend this place to my friends and so coming back!!
Todd W.}Manhattan, NY}7}45}0}-1}4}1/4/2016}tops and moderately priced for sushi lunch.  housed in the lower level of a non descript building, the japanese staff are friendly and attentive to you sushi food needs.  the daily lunch special is an assortment of soba noodles with different specialties on top of.  EXCELLENT  i suggest lunch or dinner but try and make a rez as it gets busy.
Matt B.}New York, NY}28}75}47}-1}3}12/31/2015}Lunch at Sakagura. First of all without experienced guidance I could not find this place. Its underground of a Building. You go down, and down again. Sorry but for such a good restaurant I would like to sit on street level or above and I should not be walking in a basement of building looking of the pipes and all. Just does not sound right. Once we walk in its beautiful. Really a five star restaurant. No reservation but waited for 20 minutes (though they had open tables) I ordered Soba - did not like it. Not into traditional Japanese cuisine but I did not like it. Neither did my friends who eat there usually. aside from the Soba others were ok. But that basement thing was stuck on me, and the Jackhammer noise from above the ground was the sound in meal. The manager warned us about this noise but it really felt weird. I just do not understand, if you are that good why not open in better spot rather than basement.
Wendy L.}New York, NY}262}452}549}18}5}12/31/2015}I've been here several times for dinner and always wanted to come here for lunch as their lunch sets are such a steal. I finally was able to come on a Thursday for their Bara Chirashi Don (look on their website for the daily special for the day you wish to attend as the daily special menu changes) and it was incredible! For $11.50, you get a bowl filled with an assortment of raw fish (salmon, tuna, eel to name a few) and a plate of soba. That's incredibly cheap for the amount of food that you get! Especially in the city too! Not to mention, the quality of the fish is super fresh and they don't skimp on the portions! My boyfriend got the uni soba, which radiated the uni flavor as the soba came with an uni broth. They only serve 7 of these a day so definitely come here before/once they open if you want to try this! Though good, I preferred the Bara Chirashi Don more as I love sushi/sashimi. You know it's good when you walk out of the restaurant and EVERYONE has this dish on their table. The atmosphere and service is excellent as well. From the moment you sit down, the waiter greets you with a warm towel. I would suggest making a reservation regardless of whether you're coming here for lunch or dinner as the restaurant fills up quickly, but go try to come for lunch! You won't regret it! Finally, since I guarantee you'll want to return here for lunch again, ask for the daily stamp card; the more stamps you get, the better the prize!I'm really upset I don't work in the Midtown area, otherwise I'd be a lunch regular!
Sherry L.}Westwood, NJ}15}9}217}-1}3}12/30/2015}We went for lunch with 4 adults, 2 kids. Very busy but the waiter and waitresses were all very kind. We wanted to try the beef tongue that everyone recommended but it was only for dinner. Uni soba was pretty good.  Constructions were happening and it was extremely noisy. The basement is a cool idea but it was very crowded and tight space. Overall, it's just average but I'll probably go again for diner specials.
Helene C.}Honolulu, HI}31}162}6}-1}5}12/30/2015}I like to go there during lunch time as it's close to work. But it's better to go early because it gets crowded during that time. This place is located downstairs, inside a commercial building. It's not easy to spot from outside.They have daily special lunch set but I ordered a la carte:Seaweed salad: comes in a good portion size and has a great variety of good quality seaweed (akatosaka, ogonori, tosaka, wakame), with a choice of ponzu or sesame dressing. Sanma onigiri: cooked rice wrapped with fillet of pike mackerel. They use sticky rice and it's so delicious! It's served with a pile of pickled ginger.Soba salad: seaweed, mixed greens, red radish tomato, Oba leaf, radish sprouts. Served with sesame dressing and bonito infused soy sauce and a side of pickled cucumber. I like the generous amount of seaweed. I prefer cold noodles. The reason is that I don't get to burn my mouth sipping into a hot broth, and also the noodles seems chewier when it's not soaked in hot liquid.I was sitting at the bar and I could see the pastry chef preparing the dessert plates. They have a good range of items on their dessert menu. There was some construction going on next door and you can hear all the noise inside the restaurant. So don't bring a date! Perhaps, bring your enemy? :P
Psuedoephedrine C.}New York, NY}4}52}4}-1}5}12/27/2015}I love this place. It is by far the most impressive izakaya esque place in NYC and that's saying a lot given the selection. To be fair, its also priced accordingly. The atmosphere and aesthetic is gorgeous and the seating it spacious. I highly recommend getting a reservation as it is always filled. The hot stone meat is a must have and a sake tasting is well worth it. They have an endless selection of sakes and I found some of my favorites here.
Jungmin L.}Boston, MA}0}255}0}-1}5}12/25/2015}This is a real hidden gem. You have to go into a random office building, then walk down the stairs to find it. A huge restaurant opens up behind the discreet entrance...EVERYTHING is super good. The beef tongue stew is warm, hearty, full of flavor and the beef tongue is amazingly tender and chewy at the same time; the soba noodles have the buckwheat nuttiness, perfect texture, and the uni soba is honestly the best in manhattan hands down. Refreshing, full of fresh uni flavor, I can't wait to eat it again when I get the chance. (It's a whole another level from places like Soba ya, soba totto, etc, that also have uni soba)If you can, GO!
Ms B.}Brooklyn, NY}0}17}2}-1}5}12/21/2015}i can not say enough good things about this place. i have been here more than a dozen time and it does not disappoint EVER! i have brought soo many friends and colleagues here and everyone loves it- they all want to return and share the place with others as well. they have one of the best sake menus in the city and the food complements it perfectly. the short ribs and agedashi tofu are always favorites! i have had nearly everyone of the desserts and they are all amazing. the pork belly is killer and so are the eggplant dishes. soo many more things to try as well. the ambiance is incredible, dont be worried as you travel downstairs.. it is worth withholding your judgement for a couple more steps as you open the door into this underground beauty, you feel transported into a sake cellar that is unlike anything else, you have to experience it.
Josh L.}Manhattan, NY}11}82}0}-1}3}12/20/2015}Limited offerings on their menu but the dishes that we usually order are cooked to the right degree. Like their edamame, cod and duck breast.
Junah K.}Manhattan, NY}57}44}97}-1}5}12/17/2015}Overall: hard to find for first visit but definitely worth going for Japanese food!!Things I liked:- Great service with nice staff + ambiance where it's not too loud but not too quiet- Sake bottle beautifully placed in a bamboo vase with floral decoration. Never received a sake bottle such as this so it was a nice touch for me and my friend.- Uni soba and black sesame creme brulee! Loved them and recommend you to try them!Second visit: STILL AMAZING!! Definitely recommending this place to people searching for good Japanese food + sake. It is pricy, but worth a visit.
N P.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}2}12/15/2015}I have been here roughly once a year for the past 7-8 years, a very cool spot, like a hidden gem in a basement location. Service has always been awesome but the food quality has gone way down. I was at Sakagura last week and the sashimi assortment looked fantastic, but was fishy tasting which grossed out my whole meal. (Uni was good which is hard to mess up...., tuna was chewy and slighly fishy, but the sushi chef did not take the time to trim an artery off the tuna... a big NO-NO!  and the other white fish selection was just very fishy and I couldn't even eat it!We also got the beef that you cook yourself on the stone, in which the steak was actually chewy, which was a huge shock to me. It used to be soo good here, not sure what has happened???  Bill was roughly $175 for 2 people, appetizer, dinner and drinks, definitely not worth it.
Alejandro L.}Northville, MI}22}60}5}-1}4}12/14/2015}Spectacular food, fast and attentive oriental service. If you are looking for rolls and sashimi, this is not the place, but if you are looking for awesome real Japanese food creatively prepared, you will love it.The only down side is the location. In a wet and smelly basement that makes you second guess where the heck you are going to eat. When you enter the actual restaurant, it's an oasis, but they need to move out of that place.
Jodi G.}Brookline, MA}432}52}42}18}5}12/11/2015}I tried sea urchin for the first time here! Before coming in, my boyfriend warned me that it was a basement-like atmosphere until you are seated and not to be turned off by that. I am so glad he did. this was one of the most delicious "splurge" meals I have had in a long long time! The first course was the sashimi appetizer- which I would recommend to any adventurous Sushi lover. This is where the sea urchin came out and was melt in your mouth wonderful! They warn you as you order what the daily options are so if you do NOT like anything specific you can change your mind- well worth the $54.Next we had salmon with rice, we also had the best grilled octopus I have ever tasted. It was prepared so well you could see the skewer marks clearly and precisely! At the end, we had dessert Saki with our sesame creme brulee, which I would recommend over anything and everything. This was an absolute delicacy! it was heaven in my mouth! wonderful and delicious we couldn't stop eating it just to figure out why it was SO good! When we were choosing Saki our waitress was very helpful and sounded highly knowledgeable in guiding us in the proper styles and types- even giving us a taste before we purchased a bottle.I would recommend Sakagura for a nice meal out for a special occasion!
G L.}ASTORIA, NY}0}3}0}-1}4}12/10/2015}An intimate Japanese place tucked away in the basement floor. Everything is so good, but I especially enjoy their lunch deals and desserts. Service is also very good and attentive. Definitely one of the best izakayas here!
David L.}East Village, Manhattan, NY}13}11}3}-1}3}12/9/2015}Keeping It Simple:3.5Fairly large selection of sake. (Certainly a plus)Meat dishes were better than their seafood dishes.- the flavor for the seafood items just wasn't there. I want bold flavors but i didn't get that.The value vs quality of the meal is not quite enough for me for a second visit.Service is friendly but nothing spectacularly special.- our guy knew his sake selection (another plus)Probably not coming again unless with friends, i didn't notice anything special about the restaurant besides it being in the basement of a random office building in midtown.
Jingyi L.}Paramus, NJ}6}15}4}-1}4}12/6/2015}I was known this restaurant recommend by my friend. If I wouldn't know this restaurant I will miss the one of best Japanese style restaurant in NYC. It locate at 43rd st between 2nd and 3rd Ave in the basement. The food is so great and fresh. But we order some food in menu they are sold out or do not have in that day.
Gabrielle D.}Brooklyn, NY}105}13}0}-1}5}12/4/2015}such a delightful hidden jewel. beautiful sake service and the food looks great.
Christy L.}Long Island City, Queens, NY}223}314}79}-1}4}12/1/2015}First & most importantly (since no one else talks about this ;p)PARKING: easy and free after 7pm on weeknights This restaurant is best described as a Japanese tapa's bar.  The prices are very fair averaging 10/12 dollars of course with the specials being higher in the 20s.  I had a small sashimi assorted platter which was my most favorite simply because of the salmon. I've never had such thick slice of buttery fatty smooth salmon before! Next, the fried tofu puff was memorable, along with the spicy salmon roe rice ball. Black cod fish is also pretty good. Chicken Karage, coffee pudding/ice cream, crab sticky rice, black sesame creme brulee were the less memorable of the bunch.  Overall, the service was a bit on the slower side. The food is pretty good, but I imagine this restaurant is unique for it's ambiance.. the decor is on point! IT feels very "authentic", and makes for a great date night or special occasion. It's true tho what others say about it being sketchy/smelly when walking down to this basement restaurant. It's easily one of the best Japanese establishments I've tried.
Glenn C.}Fair Lawn, NJ}189}1187}135}18}4}12/1/2015Updatedreview}We went back here for a dinner a while ago. This time it was a group of 5 and it was hard to order enough food to satisfy everyone as the portion sizes are pretty small. We were in the closer room which is a bit less nice but still good. The ambiance here is still amazing. Most of the food was fine albeit the miso cod someone got was fishy. The sake special of the day was delicious along with my glass of Koshu (aged sake, try it, it's quite sweet/delicious.) The free-range chicken was also pretty good.In general, the food here is still better than Hagi but I don't recommend coming here with a large appetite, especially with a larger group. It's hard to split such short courses and even 3/4/5 things a person was barely enough.I still think the food here is delicious but the prices are high. Go here as a sake bar and expect the food to be amazing but have pretty small portions/high price.
Fred M.}Pittsburgh, PA}0}2}0}-1}5}11/28/2015}So unique. My #1 favorite NY Lunch. Pop for the $33.00 Special. Includes Chocolate Souffle.Remarkable.Fab
C C.}Los Angeles, CA}108}194}203}-1}1}11/28/2015}Ordered the sake tekka "half" don for lunch, which has tuna and salmon sashimi along with salmon roe. It was tasty but gave me food poisoning the next day. I haven't experienced this even from the mediocre sushi places around my office. The waiter made me feel very rushed during my meal as well.Sakagura, I expected more from you, but I'm not coming back anymore.
Chip E.}Raleigh, NC}13}88}0}-1}5}11/25/2015}Awesome food. Great izakaya atmosphere (a big one though). Fantastic sake list. Can't wait to get back.
Tony G.}Saint Helena, CA}60}9}0}-1}5}11/24/2015}Stay away from Yasuda and come here. So much better and soooo much nicer. Great atmosphere and the food is fantastic. I will come back every time I'm in NYC.
Pooline N.}Brooklyn, NY}57}223}212}18}4}11/22/2015}Best sashimi I have had outside of Japan. Tried several things on the menu and all were delicious.  The udon noodles were a lot thinner than I have had before but still delicious served with a light tasty broth. Extensive sake list on offer and very helpful and knowledgable staff.  Pricey but worth a try!
Monica P.}Brooklyn, NY}415}208}395}-1}5}11/19/2015}A hidden gem that you would need to secure a reservation to! Once you have found the place, you'll feel like you entered in to an underground cozy and intimate Japanese izakaya joint that serves up really delicious Japanese dishes with a nice array of sake selection that is presented the most adorable way to you for all the sake enthusiasts out there! I was pleased that they were able to squeeze me in earlier than my original reservation time even though I made one last minute... and even when I arrived about half an hour early, they seated me 15 mins earlier than my reservation at the sake bar where i received nothing short of a good service for my dinner. I told him the sake I normally like and he let me try a few until I found one that was enjoyable... which was served in such a cute carafe presentation! We enjoyed every single dish we ordered but here's somewhat of the arranged order of what we liked most.SASHIMI SPECIAL - we had amberjack, red snapper, stripebass, fatty tuna, and uni. If you generally love sashimi, DO NOT SKIP THIS. I was pleasantly surprised at how truly fresh every single piece was with generous fat cuts. Everything was either smooth, completely melts in your mouth like the tuna, or very sweet like the uni!GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI - miso stewed beef tongue. It's not often that a restaurant can get me to like beef tongue... but so far only Blue Ribbon Izakaya and now Sakagura has made me love their beef tongue. It was so soft and tender while the stew was really rich, bursting with incredible flavors from the miso and mushroom too!HOT STONE WASHU BEEF - my oh my, the marbling on that nice beautiful red color of beef was seriously buttery and just melts in your mouth when you cook it to the perfect medium rare thats suggested! Perfect when you enhance it with a tiny squeeze of the lemon, pinch of salt, a tad smear of the wasabi on it... or lightly dipping it in the sauce too!UNI SOBA - handmade buckwheat noodles drenched in delicious sea urchin broth topped with their fresh sweet uni (sea urchin)... another very delicious dish! BUTA KAKUNI - not the most tender of pork I've had before... it was a tad dry with a serious chunk of fat on it... but it's the broth that was incredibly tasty with a nice sweet noteTUNA TARTARE - this was alright, not bad but nothing memorable or special either. Our least favorite dish of the night, we could've went without this dish.BLACK SESAME CREME BRULEE - one of my favorite black sesame desserts I've had! This was perfect; the black sesame ice cream with the perfectly caramelized custard and black sesame chip on top... I couldn't get enough!
Bakchun K.}New York, NY}90}492}1110}18}4}11/17/2015}This place was very confusing to get to.  I walk down 43rd street and see this mad nice sushi restaurant through a window, like its part of a TV show series, I walk in and it's sushi yasuda, oops.  Then I went around and looked, the restaurant appears to be inside an office building.  I'm like where the heck is this place? Then I was told to go two stories down, feels like I'm being escorted down into a secret gambling parlor, felt a little uneasy going down through hallways and two flight of stairs.  After all this suspense, I'm finally here.  You need to make reservations or else you will be waiting quite a bit.  We made reservations.  The setting is dark, candle lit, with tables across the floor and sake and beer selection against the walls with bar seating, not with bar like chairs but regular table chairs.The menu selection is that that huge but just enough. It really is not a sushi type place but they offer a small selection of sushi.  I had the crab meat rice.  They say on the menu it will take 40-45 minutes.  I guess they need to fly the superjet to Japan to get the crab, get all the crab meat out and then cook the rice together.  It came in a casserole type pot.  It serves two people, it's about two small bowls of rice.  I can easily finish that but I'm not an average person.  I had salmon sashimi which was not on the menu, it was fresh but a bit hard because it wasn't defrosted enough.I had the uni soba.  It came with uni soup which was quite unique.  I had the fluke carpaccio, which is sashimi.  For dessert had the sesame creme brûlée.  The uni soba and crab meat rice was unique but it tasted pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary.  The creme brûlée was delicious.  Service was good as the guy checked up on is quite often.  Prices are reasonable.It's not a bad spot for a date.
Patrick A.}Kirkland, Canada}66}36}0}-1}4}11/17/2015}This is a really great place! The atmosphere feels kinda like an upscale izakaya. Despite being in the basement of the building, the way the restaurant is decorated makes you forget about the lack of daylight.The food was excellent, although I would have liked to see a little bit more selection in the menu. This is a great place for sharing a variety of small plates with a group of people.They also had a nice list of sake.The prices are a little bit high, but the quality is good and justifies the price of the meal.I would recommend coming here if you are looking for a slightly fancier Japanese food experience than the average Japanese NYC place.
Nana K.}San Anselmo, CA}1}23}0}-1}5}11/16/2015}I am giving 5 stars because I generally like places like this.  The appetizers were pretty good.  I think I had one so-so dish but overall, I give it two thumbs up.  My boyfriend and I tried couple different sakes.  We haven't been to their sake tasting but we are planning to go to one soon.  Want something different, check this place out.  Kinda like Japanese tapas, sorta...I also really like the ladies room :)
Anthony S.}Hopewell, NJ}21}4}1}-1}5}11/15/2015}Best sushi I've ever had.  Came in without a reservation at 12:00 on Monday and they sat me right down and held my bag for me at the desk.  Was in and out in 30 minutes.  Fantastic!
Sarah F.}Deep River, CT}46}440}82}18}5}11/14/2015}What an adventure! Firstly, finding this place is a maze of hallways and secret tunnels. ;) Once inside, it's like stepping into a portal. Lots of business dudes in suits making deals didn't distract from the great lunch specials. Noodles, sashimi, soup, all delish! But really... The toilet! Heated, bidet in a round heaven.
Somin Y.}Manhattan, NY}127}207}65}-1}3}11/12/2015}There are over 1,200 reviews with a weighted average rating of 4+ stars, Though there is not much that I can value add, let me highlight two things that I liked about this place vs. two things that I didn't like.Pros:1) As some of yelpers know, regulations set by City Health Department of New York City have been changed since this summer such that all raw fish should be first frozen before served to a table. All sashimi/raw fish that you are tasting at Sakagura is not really "fresh"  - all this raw fish was once frozen. Nonetheless, it was very fresh, and I couldn't taste/smell something bothering me. (Trust me, I'm a native Korean, who were born and raised in Koreaand has tasted raw fish, or sashimi, for more than 20+ years). 2) If you are a big fan of sake, please try this place. Seriously, they have an extensive selection of sake (more than 12 pages of menu), and we couldn't pick one at a first glance. Warning, however, is that some of the sake bottles are pricey - over $150 per bottle. Your bill can easily go beyond $300 for only drinks. Cons:1) It seems that they have many food options, but for me it was not the case at least for evening dinner/drinks.  Most of the food options are very much similar to one another - tartar with tuna/salmon/etc, grilled chicken/beef/etc. Several food that are available at any Izakaya places - such as takoyaki, ikonomiyaki, or takowasa - were not available. 2) small portion compared to the price. We really liked black cod with soy sauce, but I paid more than $10 for two small pieces.I don't think I'd come back in the near future, unless I'm craving for a new flavor of sake.
Shonnie H.}Manhattan, NY}596}539}2419}18}3}11/11/2015Updatedreview}Tiny shop that's adorable but overpriced. With a Mitsuwa 5 minutes from my house, I just can't help but say that I don't like their choices in diversifying their snack offerings and their meals are .. for ants. $10 chirashi? How dare they, when Soba Totto has $10.50 bara chirashi w/ soba (which is the most BOMB meal you can ever get at that price) right next door? I'm never going to have an emergency need for a Japanese snack. Coming from a home where there's NO shortage of same, I'm not coming here unless I absolutely have to. When is that, you ask? Well, today, is Pocky/Pepperro day (11/11)- Yelper Rich B. felt an incredible need to get a Pocky or 3, so we dropped by before going to Soba Totto. Given the size of their store, absolutely tinky winky, I wasn't expecting much anyway. I don't want a really cold onigiri either. but this little spot sure can be entertaining for many.
Jennifer Z.}Las Vegas, NV}591}338}325}-1}3}11/11/2015}This place was cool. 400$ bill cool.We went here for a business dinner. It's hidden in a basement within a basement. Elegant and very traditional Japanese interior and really cool bathrooms.We got the cod, few pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi, oysters, ebi stick, and the steak you cook on a hot rock. Their sake selection was really impressive.This place is definitely not a sushi roll place. It's more dishes and plain sashimi. They have no rolls. Everything is really small and expensive but you're paying for the quality. The food takes forever to come out because everything is cooked perfectly. This is definitely your fancy foofoo 5 star Japanese restaurant where you pay for a lettuce leaf for 150$ the food was good but super expensive.I'd stick with Benihana for a Japanese experience
Jon S.}Brooklyn, NY}123}642}1}18}5}11/10/2015}Sakagura means roughly "hidden liquor" in Japanese and reaching this combination izakaiya/sushi bar/sake bar requires a leap of faith that yes, there really is a restaurant down there. In the grand tradition of many of Tokyo's very best establishments, it is meant for those that know where to look.Find it and you'll arrive in what is probably New York's most attractive basement. The only reminder that this is underground is the poor cell service (it's really bad - make sure first-time diners are quite clear on how to find it). The elaborate atmosphere evokes a Japanese tea house without coming across as kitsch. The crowd is mostly Japanese and clustered around mealtimes. Come in between for excellent sake and surprising place for a quiet meeting. Sakagura will remain a special place for me because it's where I asked my current employer to take me on the lunch where they offered me a job. The food is solid if unspectacular. In a city where nearly every Japanese dish has a restaurant dedicated to solely serving the perfect version of it, this just isn't the top of the scale. There are also few duds and the fish is well prepared. No one will have a bad experience. I know - I've taken many people here.
Tanya N.}Eastside, Las Vegas, NV}0}34}44}-1}3}11/10/2015}Went there and it was a little confusing if you don't know that it's in a basement of an office building. It's like Japanese tapas and pretty good. We were there late and enjoyed the atmosphere.
Lucy C.}New York, NY}131}1173}43}18}4}11/10/2015}Came here for lunch with my dad and little sister. This place was as hard to find as a speakeasy, which I guess adds to the appeal, but it definitely isn't as secret as one. The wait during lunch is pretty long, and reservations need to be made in advance basically. While the decor was cute and traditional, you can still see the basement-y ceilings. The food was really really good, as indicated by the above average pricing. The sashimi platter was very fresh and I could definitely recommend it. My father's hot soupy soba was really excellent. It doesn't come with any toppings, which we were disappointed about at first, but the soup was some of the best soup I've ever had--addictive yet light. Sister's cold soba dish was just as good. Entrees came with many little appetizers which were all standard but done very well. Nigori sake was BOMB. I had it served cold and it came in a champagne glass--super sweet and refreshing. I highly recommend this place for lunch if you work in the area.
Asheena M.}Phoenix, AZ}21}35}14}-1}5}11/5/2015}Amazing Japanese food and sake ..No sushi , yes you heard it right.. It's real Japanese food. Great meats and so healthy .. Went in for a business dinner and totally loved the ambience and food . Not loud and semi casual setting ..
Noam W.}Manhattan, NY}0}20}0}-1}4}11/5/2015}Great little place - like a bit of Tokyo under the ground in NY.
Cynthia D.}Queens, NY}454}803}5869}18}5}11/3/2015}Get their plum wine!!! Sakagura probably have the most beautiful decor for a hidden sake bar. Very simple yet sophisticated. Jars of sake were placed around the restaurant to demonstrate this is what they are famous for. Their bar and their extensive choices of sake is amazing! Finding this spot is still a puzzle to me but lucky for me I can just follow a regular. Sakagura opens at 6:00 pm and there is already a crowd of walk-in's and ones who made reservations. My friend and I shared a variety of dishes from our last few visits. Here are some of our favorites: Sake Oyako Don, Gindara Yuan-Yaki, Maguro Yamakake, and Surumeika Yaki.Sake Oyako Don is a salmon sashimi with salmon roe with seaweed over rice topped with just a bit of soy sauce. Love the fresh fish taste.Gindara Yuan-Yaki is the codfish fillet marinated in miso. The fish skin was the best part!Maguro Yamakake is tuna sashimi with mountain yam. At first sight, the white mountain yam is so sticky and gooey. I was hesitate to eat this but hey, it was not too bad.Surumeika Yaki is the grilled squid. I loved the end charred pieces of the tentacles and sweet sauce that it was brushed with.If you're dining at a sake bar, you should not leave without having a drink! I personally love the fruity drinks especially the Mito No Kairakuen 5 Y.O. This is a plum wine that is shochu-based. It was sweet and delicious. When ordered as a carafe, it comes with a fancy glass-stained cup. Not to mention, they got Yuzu sake too!!!Update: My sister and I came by for lunch one random day!Thursday Lunch Special: Bara Chirashi & Hot/Cold Soba Noodles. It's delicious and great value. Chirashi came with small pieces of salmon, tuna, squid, shrimp, and tamago over rice. A big plate of soba noodles is served as well. I opt in for cold option. Texture was the perfect balance of soft and chewy. For their dipping sauce, I mixed it with scallions and wasabi. The dried seaweed on top of the soba noodles added a tasty flavor. It was so filling! Get it!
Jen S.}Jackson Heights, Queens, NY}160}204}586}18}3}10/29/2015Updatedreview}Update- went back recently & had a decent experience. Get a reservation to avoid a wait for larger parties. The booths are nice. The menu can be overwhelming, lots of choices. We ordered fluke, tuna tartare, soy cod, eel with cucumber, chicken meatballs, beef stew, eggplant, and duck. All were good, but small portions for sharing. The servers can be aggressive about clearing plates & pouring water, but overall efficient. I'd say a little overpriced for what you get, but very tasty.
Sean C.}Long Island City, NY}215}122}80}-1}3}10/26/2015}Honestly, this place is a little disappointing. Not a lot of food for a lot of money. My cousin and I came here for dinner per his suggestion.We ordered the following to share:Miso SoupsSashimi Special (3-pieces of 5 different types of sashimi)Onsen Tamago (Soft boiled egg in miso with roe and sea urchin)Sliced Beef served on a Hot StoneLobster Rice2 Carafe's of SakeThe food was good especially the sashimi but the prices here are a little overrated. My cousin and I left with a $100 bill each. Also, the service was mediocre. The waiters never check on you to see how you're meal is and are impossible to find when you need some assistance.
Greg G.}Baltimore, MD}30}14}19}-1}4}10/24/2015}Great restaurant overall. Ate there for the first time tonight and for authentic Japanese food at a decent price you won't do better. I really enjoyed the fried chicken and the fried pork was outstanding. My girlfriend and her parents liked the 'foam' (for the uninitiated like me, it is like the foam on a draft beer, but much worse) but it wasn't my cup of tea. Sake was great too. Overall, I would highly recommend (but stay away from the foam and fermented beans). The only real downside is I felt a little rushed by the waitstaff, which seemed eager to get the next table seated. A small point in the grand scheme of things, given the great food.
Ben V.}Brussels, Belgium}3}81}23}-1}4}10/22/2015}I wanted to go to an overall interesting place for my birthday and was not disappointed with Sakagura. And right in my and my best friends Midtown East hood. It already starts with the very confusing location. It's located in a office style apartment building. There's even a reception. I was sure we were in the wrong place. And then it's in the cellar of that building. Very bizarre.But it's really cozy. We sat at the bar and had the following dishes:-black edamame. Never had this. Much better.-grilled mackerel-cold buckwheat noodles-grilled chicken, perfectly crunchy-red bean pastryNever ate any of these dishes before. Was awesome. Great food, great friend, great birthday.
Annie P.}Brooklyn, NY}2}27}72}-1}4}10/20/2015}I loved the experience, the service, the decor, and food presentation. I didnt exactly enjoy what I ate. I had soba which came with yuzu soba sauce and I dont really like yuzu, but i'm sure another person would like it. I would come again and try something else. I had sushi and it wasnt very fresh bc of discoloring and fishy taste. The food was a little one the pricey side, i think everything else makes up for it though!
Deb G.}Houston, TX}46}6}0}-1}5}10/20/2015}Wow, we happened upon this hidden gem by accident. INCREDIBLE sake menu. And EVERYTHING we ordered was Amazing: Seaweed salad with 4 types of seaweed and sesame dressingJapanese eggplant with 3 different saucesBlack cod in sweet soy sauceHomemade salted chocolate sorbet and lychee sorbetSooooo good and incredible atmosphere!  They got us in even though we didn't have a reservation, but you probably want to make a reservation in advance.
Tillie K.}Staten Island, NY}10}300}182}-1}5}10/19/2015}Mmmm their food was yummy. I had the platter of sashimi to share with my 2 friends. 3 pcs of each so it was 1 each for 3 of us. it was a good portion. I had the salmon sashimi with rice over roe. It was fresh. I also had the cod fish as an app. The price was decent for a Japanese spot in midtown. The location was interesting since it was at the basement of a building. Once you get down there it's like you're in another world lol
Stephane S.}Washington, DC}0}9}0}-1}5}10/13/2015}A hidden gem of a place! Quite litterally (it's hard to find). Great decor. The portions are small but every dish was delicious. A great experience, I will definitely recommend (and be back)!
Jenn W.}New York, NY}0}14}0}-1}4}10/10/2015}Feels like a little piece of Japan in the city. The atmosphere is intimate and relaxing. Sake list is really astounding. There are about ten different flights available so you can try many different varieties. We tried about 10 different small dishes while we were there, only one of them was a little underwhelming. Overall very high quality drinks and food in a great space.
Tessa D.}Back Bay, Boston, MA}269}235}584}18}2}10/8/2015}More of a 2.5 than a flat 2, but I round down, so a 2 is what Kiosku is left with. The location is a bit strange to get to, it's inside of an office building or something? I had to ask the front desk where Kiosku was, and they easily directed me to it. Just keep walking straight essentially. It is TINY. The size of a street cart maybe? They don't have a wide range of fresh items, just a couple bentos from what I saw. Cafe Zaiya/Benton Cafe/Sunrise Mart have WAY more options. Kiosku seems to focus more on dried snacks, Japanese candies, and sodas. It's sort of a tiny Japanese deli I guess? I grabbed an inari trio bento and a chirashi bowl, came out to $18.51. The credit card minimum is $10, and considering most of their items are under that price you might have to get a couple of things. I personally found the food a bit expensive. For the same price of what I got I could've had a much more filling meal in an actual restaurant. Visually the dishes looked nice, especially the chirashi bowl, but taste-wise they were pretty lacking. The inari bento came in a convenient box, but the inari themselves were hard, cold, and the fillings weren't very delicious. One had mushy edamame that just tasted gross. The tamago that came with that bento were soggy and flavorless. As for the pickled side dishes, WAY too salty. I'd gotten this specific order for my boyfriend and he wound up passing on it halfway through and getting a cheesesteak instead. The only things he wound up liking from it were the chicken karaage. My chirashi bowl was edible, but the freshness of the fish was questionable. A few of the ikura (salmon eggs) were browning, the salmon had lots of sinew, and the ika (squid) was very slimy. The best proteins in the bowl were the shrimp and the unagi (eel). I did wind up eating the whole thing, but mostly because I was famished.Definitely won't be coming back here again. But maybe if your office is nearby and you want something quick and easy this may be a good choice? Although personally I'd go to Benton Cafe instead.
Bruce H.}Santa Barbara, CA}296}23}0}-1}4}10/4/2015}A gem of a place, tucked away in a basement.  Relaxed atmosphere and delicious food -- especially the nasu (eggplant) in three kinds of miso, and the onigiri with spicy cod roe. I ate lots of small dishes and found it very satisfying.
Jennifer C.}Santa Monica, CA}213}120}298}18}4}10/4/2015}My Korean girlfriend who lives only couple blocks away took me here.Me growing up in Japan and my mom being a great cook, I'm hard to be pleased especially when it comes to Japanese food.This place is in the basement and hard to find, so they are mostly locals. Many people who work there are Japanese, and many of the customers were Japanese.We ordered just the Japanese comfort food, no sashimi.Beef tongue stew (the meat was so tender and tasty) and Chicken karaage reminded me of my mom's home cooked meal ( meaning you already know...), and Unagi with cucumber and wakame seaweed, I thought it was kind of a strange combo, but it was refreshing and delicious.Sake (salmon) and roe rice came with miso soup and tsukemono (Japanese pickles), the Sake was supposed to be fillet but to me it tasted it like smoked salmon but it was also delicious.For dessert, my girlfriend told me every time she's been here, they didn't have sakemanjuu, so we decided to try iy. It came with green tee sorbet and the presentation was so cute! It wasn't too sweet and it was delicious.Everything was delicious, I was very pleased and satisfied.If I lived near here, I will come here by myself sit at the bar at least once a week.
Shab A.}Alpine, NJ}207}153}228}-1}5}10/1/2015}What's better than a japanese restaurant? A Japanese TAPAS restaurant!!! I thank heavens for the Japanese people, their food, their perfectionism!!! This place was heaven! Starting from their incredibly delicious sweet sauce cod, miso soup, fried eggplant, eel appetizers, ending with their amazing service, incredible ambience and of course, Japanese toilet (I had to mention this!), everything was top notch! As James Bond says, I will be back!
Mike B.}WALL STREET, NY}14}10}0}-1}4}10/1/2015}I have only been here for lunch, which has always been great.  I do recommend coming early, or making a reservation though, because it can get crowded. Also the restaurant can be tricky to find, as the door is inside of a hotel/office building lobby, but once you go downstairs the place has a nice atmosphere.I usually get the Soba Gozen or the Jewel Bento, both of which are good and pretty authentic to similar dishes I've had at restaurants in Japan. With that being said, be forewarned that they use seasonal ingredients and the Japanese taste seems to lean toward very fishy flavored types of fish.  I prefer a more mild taste, so it helps to talk to the waiter as they can talk to the chef and will sometimes try to switch things up for you.A great place to try for an authentic Japanese lunch.
Nik G.}Ilford, United Kingdom}21}5}2}-1}5}9/27/2015}Incredible! This hidden gem deserves more visibility than the paltry sign next to the office revolving door. Take Stair F and descend into this wonderful slice of traditional Japanese culture with an air of acid jazz playing overhead. The choice of sake is mind blowing and if you haven't a clue, the waiters are skilled enough to recommend a good option based on your preferences.The food  is served with distinct Japanese professionalism and is delicious through all three courses. For the price, this is excellent value and would recommend hunting this place down to impress a date or client.
Carl L.}Northbrook, IL}0}16}10}-1}4}9/25/2015}Very authentic and food was really tasty. It was little bit pricy for the quality and freshness maybe my expectation was too high. Overall, it was a great and beautiful restaurant. Service was just ok nothing phenominal.
S K.}New York, NY}52}108}84}-1}4}9/20/2015}After a 5 year hiatus, I made it back here on a Saturday evening.  It was surprisingly not as crowded as I remember - a reservation made the night before was easily acquired.  The food is still great izakaya fare at a good price point.  The essential items to order in my opinion include the Daikon salad with mentaiko mayonnaise (super cool and refreshing, goes well with sake), the Buta Kakuni, which is the most flavorful piece of stewed pork I've eaten in a while, and the Chawanmushi which departs from tradition with thickened ponzu.The Japanese draft beers are good, and the sake list is very impressive.
John R.}Lawrence, MA}28}70}1}-1}4}9/19/2015}Good place for sushiLocal too the office and a great place to stop by for a quick dinner.  Authentic sushi atmosphere with good service.  4 stars because I will go back again.
Chloe G.}New York, NY}96}173}533}-1}3}9/18/2015}Midtown east is the only neighborhood I didn't go for dinner often. A large reason is my place is around Columbus circle and my work place is at the heart of flatiron. I have tried the most good ones at west village, Chelsea and midtown west Hell's Kitchen. And yelp helped me figured out there's an entire empire of good restaurant located around midtown east from 45- 72st. This location is so hidden but the food is so authentic, my BF and I will expand our territory to midtown East Asian restaurants from now on. There's tons of good ones this neighborhood. I'm so excited I'm this close. The downside is the portion are tiny. We ordered so much and still hungry.
Maggie J.}New York, NY}0}12}1}-1}1}9/11/2015}The service the is WORST I have ever experienced. The female server is rude and mean. My friend asked something about the menu and the server acted impatiently. Asked for paper napkins and she even didn't respond. We wanted to see the dessert menu but have not got it even until we left. Ordered two order of oyster and one is even smaller than half the normal size. This is not like what a restaurant like this should have done to the customers. We tried to talked to the server and she laughed at us and talked it like a joke to other servers. The manager came and said they would exchange. We waited for like 20 minutes and they never made the oysters again. Very unhappy about this RUDE service. The food is good but so what? I know they don't care cauz they are famous and have a lot customers. But if they continue to act like this they will lose the customers eventually. There are a lot good Japanese restaurants with good services in the city. I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.
Jun T.}Washington, DC}1}22}11}-1}3}9/11/2015}Came here with a high expectation. Got oyakodon soba set for lunch special. The food was ok, but sadly it cannot be compared with the oyakodon I had in Tokyo. The egg was slightly overcooked and the soba was okay. Friendly staffs and good ambience. Will come back to try their hayashi rice.
Soren N.}ASTORIA, NY}82}205}75}18}5}9/8/2015}It's fun getting to Sakagura as you circle through a lobby and head into the basement of a cozy restaurant that offers (for better in my opinion) great food and poor levels of cell phone reception. I came here for lunch and tried the 'Jewel' Oke Bento box (according to the menu only 10 are made per day) and have to say it was really good. I especially enjoyed the salmon and the kakiage tempura-fried to perfection. For dessert, I tried the crème brûlée with black sesame and it was delicious. It's one of the best desserts I've had. The total bill was around $32-although pricy, it was well worth it. It's best to get a reservation as the place was very full for lunch. The staff was very attentive.
Vivian B.}New York, NY}6}9}19}-1}5}9/2/2015}It is expensive！I ordered sashimi ，disappointed，I prefer sashimi in Hatsuhana that dream of box ，cheap，fresh，and every sashimi with rice！About hot stone beef，you should cook Beef quickly，we take picture of it for long time，when we start to cook Beef on hot Stone，stone already not hot ，anyway，I do not like here ，end of story ！
Anny S.}New York, NY}141}139}725}-1}5}8/30/2015}I love Sakagura. It's just simple good Japanese food with a lot of variation in their menu. It's located in the basement of a building, and it's not a place you really just stumble past while walking in the city. I usually come here on a whim, no reservations, and when I'm craving for some fresh fish and some small bites. Their menu is divided into three sections: cold dishes, hot dishes, and rice and noodles.My favorite dishes include:- Fluke Carpaccio (so, so, so fresh)- Jaga Dango (uh because it's mashed potatoes coated in sweet donut batter fried crisp?)- Maguro Tartar (tuna tartare with flying fish roe - definitely get this please!)- Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce - fish is cooked perfectly, flakes nicely with hint of sweetness)- Onigiri Rice Balls (super filling DIY onigri with topping choices -- YUM)- Sake Oyako Don (Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Steeped in Soy Sauce Served Atop a Bowl of Rice -- MY FAV...this is JUST TOOOOO GOOODD!!)Save room for dessert! I really like their black sesame ice cream.
Stella R.}Manhattan, NY}1}154}14}-1}4}8/28/2015}A real Japanese gem in an odd location. You feel like you're really in the know walking down the stairs.Their handmade noodles are delicious and if you have the time splurge on the tasting menu. Delicious!
Karen X.}New York, NY}215}183}163}18}5}8/28/2015}This is one of those rare gems that when you stumble upon, you feel like you're in on some secret that the rest of New York is just now revealing to you. Located in a really random looking building, through a discreet door, and down some strange-looking stairs in a basement, Sakagura makes you feel like you just stepped through the looking glass and into a secret Japanese oasis. The decor is done with as much detail as the cute perfectly combined plates of food, and though the prices are not the lowest and the portions very much "Japanese sized", you'll leave feeling very content, though not stuffed.I got the Jewel "Oke" Bento (which they only make 10 of each day) and it was a great combination of very fresh fish as well as small sampler-like appetizers. The donburi bowls with soba are also a must try because they are really known for their soba here.We finished off with dessert which also perfectly hit the spot and rounded out an overall very pleasant experience!
John K.}Bayside, NY}0}4}0}-1}2}8/28/2015}Meh, wasn't all what I expected...maybe I went there with too much expectation from all the reviews.Food is ok, nothing to rave about.Also very salty, maybe they want to sell more liquor, beers, sake and etc...Don't understand why it was so hard to make reservations when I saw a bunch of table that were empty with the sign RESERVED.Wondering if they are hyping themselves to get more credit than they deserve.Service was good, food came out fastMade me wonder if it was all pre-made already and all the do is re heat before serving.If you are a sake lover i would recommend because of their selections of sake but for food I rather go somewhere else to eat.
RayRay P.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}0}-1}4}8/28/2015}what a fun place! location is interesting - it's in the east 40's and underneath what appears to be an office building. we were looking at the entrance when an older gentleman coming out for a smoke kindly directed us downstairs.  we didn't have a reservation but it was a monday night so we were seated right away.  the menu is extensive as is the sake list and everything was incredibly good! service can be a little brusk and our waiter definitely discouraged us from experimenting, which was a little disappointing  - that's the point! but he was attentive and efficient. overall a fantastic experience and surprisingly, not too hard on the wallet.
Lily L.}Brooklyn, NY}86}56}40}-1}5}8/27/2015}Great food and service and not too long of a wait. Everything is delicious on the menu seriously! Sesame creme brulee was the best dessert ever altho they have a pretty creative list of desserts we didnt get to try yet. Oh and their chawanmushi was the best ive ever had
Peter S.}Manhattan, NY}2}71}1}-1}4}8/25/2015}Four stars only because the service was slow and the wait staff seemed a little bit disorganized.  On a Tuesday night too!  Can only imagine how chaotic the place gets on Thursday or Friday nights.Location - Inside a non-descript building, basement.  Can be difficult to find. And you have maneuver to the basement once insideFood - Japanese comfort food of sort, not as pedestrian as okonomiyaki.  Fried chicken, Japanese style steak, soy marinated pork, and etc.  Quite yummy.  The portions are small, so order several for a party of 2 at a time, especially since the wait staff can be a bit hard to find and the food does take a little bit of waiting time.Drinks - You come here for sake.  The largest sake collection here in NYC, and probably the entire US.  Price range and variety is all over the place.  I recommend that you stick to their suggested selections or specials on the back of the drink menu.  You can score a big bottle for less than $60; compare that to other bottle which cost $90 plus.Ambience - It's incredible that they built out this place in an office building in the middle of Midtown.  Minimalist yet cozy.  High ceiling.  Clean facilities.  Spacious.  No complaints. Will impress mom and dad; impress the date; and will suit business meetings quite nicely.  Only thing to be aware of is that this place probably cannot accommodate large parties too well, 6 plus.Price - It's not cheap.  On the moderate end.  Two of us ate plenty and drank a bottle and the bill came out to 80 a pop with tip included.  So yeah, if the date is a maybe, don't invest with this.  :DRSVP is a must.  And they have an inflexible, "We keep tables for 15 minutes," policy.  And they call you on the day of your RSVP to confirm and leave a message to call them back.  They take this seriously.
Al L.}Toronto, Canada}980}856}970}-1}4}8/20/2015}Sakagura is tucked in the basement of an office building. There is a line up outside, but thats for Soba Totto next door. Go inside the office building, past the red couch on the left, go down the stairs and you're right there. If you walk too far, theres a japanese convenience store there. The lady there will direct you where to go. This review is based on the lunch special, which is $11.50 + tax and tip. So all in $15. For what you get, its pretty good value. Came here on a thursday and got the Bara Chirashi Don lunch special which comes with chopped up fish on rice and soba noodles. All of it was very good and i'm super happy after this meal. I got in at open so I was in and out within 30 mins. So if you work close by, its not an excessively long wait. To be honest, probably not much longer than waiting at a chopped salad place in midtown from start to finish.
Cathy S.}New York, NY}1}4}0}-1}4}8/17/2015}Sakagura has one of the best lunch specials in the city!  For $10, you can get a soba and daily special bowl.  Sometimes it's salmon and rice, sometimes it's egg and gourd over rice.  It's always awesome.  Plus I love how they made the most of their basement space...you really feel like you are in Japan.
Hugh R.}Cleveland, OH}0}14}0}-1}5}8/10/2015}Simply my favorite restaurant in NYC.  You will not experience food like this anywhere else in the US.  Nothing else to say -- it's just fantastic.
Andrew R.}Manhattan, NY}2}42}0}-1}4}8/9/2015}High quality food and good advice on sake in an unbeatably DL location. Peak time waits can be long if not impossible (i.e. nothing available without a reservation). My only gripe is that I always leave here hungry, which is a bit irritating when a simple lunch routinely costs $40+ pp.
Joseph A.}Manhattan, NY}2}12}0}-1}4}8/9/2015}Great restaurant, good service.  We loved the Daikon Salad, Agedashi Tofu, Buta Kakuni and the Seasonal Special rice with crab meat.  The Yuba Shumai sounds better than it tastes, in our view.  The Mango Pudding also was great.  Not a big deal, but the below-street level restaurant limits cell phone signals, so keep that in mind if you are waiting to hear from someone or want to make sure the babysitter is not trying to reach you.
Beiwen Z.}Mamaroneck, NY}49}104}9}18}5}8/8/2015}ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. Yes, it's pretty pricy..but well, it's manhattan. The service was excellent and the food was simply amazing. Highly recommend the cod.
Joyce L.}Brooklyn, NY}25}241}310}-1}5}8/7/2015}Came here with my coworker after work for dinner and this was absolutely amazing. It was difficult to find but once you enter the place is very charming. We didn't make reservations but was lucky enough  to get a seat at the bar. We ordered the chicken meatballs, rice balls wrapped with mackerel, fluke carpaccio, a snow crab steamed rice and the seasonal mango pudding. The really enjoyed the rice balls which were unique and flavorful and the grilled mackerel was amazing. The chicken meatball was juicy and flavorful while the fluke carpaccio was refreshing. The rice dish fell flat and was pretty bland and lacked ingredients. The mango pudding was the star of the night. The pudding itself was full of mango flavor which was not from powdered flavoring but from fresh mango purée. I really enjoyed he food here and he service was great. Would definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu.
Mark C.}Glen Rock, NJ}96}33}2}-1}4}8/7/2015}Well now, I believe I've just discovered a pretty awesome hidden gem. One of my new favorites. This place is truly special. I've travelled to Japan on business and loved the Izakawa-style. So happy to find on yelp. I was meeting a client for dinner in midtown and wanted an excuse to give this spot a try.Sashimi & grill were both excellent.  Sake was perfect.  The experience made for a special dining experience.
Kevin B.}Boston, MA}59}19}5}-1}2}8/4/2015}As a single business traveler, I'm accustomed to being given a single seat at the bar, but I'm not accustomed to being ignored. It took nearly twenty minutes and lots of eye contact to finally get an order taken. If that wasn't enough insult, I had to endure a torn and dirty sake menu hanging over my place setting (and food) all evening, despite having only ordered an Asahi beer.I've been here multiple times before with a colleague who was fluent in Japanese and had wonderful meals, but tonight I felt like a just another gringo business guy. Sad that the manager wasn't any more attentive when I explained the situation upon my exit.
Kyle L.}Madison, WI}15}11}0}-1}1}7/31/2015}This place is terribly horrible. The food is sooooo ordinary. Nothing special. And I have several friends who tried it and said the same thing. We don't understand why this place has 4 stars. What really surprises me is the service of this place. I made a reservation but had to call to cancel. But as soon as they heard that I won't be able to come, this motherfucking bitch who took my call hung up on me. Like...seriously?! Don't go to this place. There are many other places that are way better.
Moranda B.}New York, NY}20}161}63}-1}5}7/31/2015}This place is wonderful. I didn't have anything but that I wasn't impressed or deeply satisfied by! To get into the building you have to walk through a building lobby down some stairs and into the basement. Then you open up into a lovely little I have been here twice. Both times with my sister. For the two of us we ordered between 8-10 dishes. I ordered a plum sake type drink once and it was delicious. I have no idea what it was called. The service is definitely slow but it's good. Expect to sit for at least an hour and a half for your meal. They pace each dish very nicely and the send them out in a particular order based on what you get which I like. The amount of food and the prices for the quality of it are amazing. I love getting to try so many different dishes. Also every singledish was plated so beautifully and artfully I didn't want to eat it! I don't normally like to photograph my food but I just had to at this place. Anyways now onto the food:The duck dish - cold and absurdly delicious. the duck was so tenderwashu tataki- amazing. the beef was cool and tender. and the toppings (grated daikon and only sauce + scallions) on each piece were so flavorful. fluke sashimi- great. the addition of the plum sauce was very nice. also the salmon roe they put on top is the freshest I've ever had. I didn't realize they were supposed to taste sweet and bright instead of fishy. so incredible. they are DELICIOUS. tuna sashimi with mountain yam- they warn you that the yam is a strange consistency which it is but my sister liked it for soaking up soy sauce. the tuna was fresh and delicious.shrimp and seaweed spring rolls- crunchy and fresh. love the dipping sauce. grilled squid- I love squid. this dish was amazing and cooked perfectly. clean simple and flavorful. pork belly in broth- the broth itself is worth getting the dish. the tender and sweet pork belly is wonderful. salmon sashimi over rice- got this both times. so incredibly fresh. they pile on the salmon roe which is so fresh and bursts with sweet juice. ugh! so good! fried octopus- delicious but I didn't like the sauce. fried chicken- good but needed a sauce. was a little dry. fried potato balls- these were so yummy and I loved the texture! cold uni soup- possibly one of the most amazing dishes I've had in my entire life. the flavor a blend so perfectly. the egg yolk and the soft uni and the sweet but mild broth. it's incredible. get two. you'll want the whole thing to yourself I swear. so good. black sesame creme brûlée- so delicious and perfectly done. chocolate molten cake- really good and the raspberry sauce is honestly the best I've ever had. tastes like someone just squished super fresh raspberries. my sister doesn't like fruit so I drank it.  amazing! overall an amazing place and I can't wait to go back.
Hyeonji L.}New York, NY}147}184}366}-1}4}7/29/2015}Love the ambience and food! We had to wait like 30 minutes before seated but it was worth traveling to this place! Mackerel pike rice ball was so beautiful and tasted amazing! Will get this one next time if I go this place! Just one thing I didn't like was the drink was pretty expensive and I couldn't drink so much :p If you like authentic japanese food, check this place out!
Sean S.}Pleasanton, CA}31}7}0}-1}5}7/27/2015}This place is tucked in down below street level.  You walk down into what looks like a fairly traditional Japanese restaurant.    We had several dishes including the Sushi sampler (twice).The highlight of the meal was the Sake.   The waiter (who we later found out was the Sake master) was incredibly helpful.   We started with Tokugetsu then ended with the Born Wing of Japan.  Great experience.  I cannot wait to return.
Aditi M.}Fairfax, VA}0}12}0}-1}1}7/27/2015}Ruined our night . Walked so far dreaming of sushi only to be told that they decided to close early !!!
Melissa S.}Manhattan, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}7/25/2015}I would give them zero stars if possible. His place is truly hidden like the other reviewer said. The food is ok. The service is the WORST! We went in a little late, around 10pm or so, without a reservation and the host was happy to help us find a table, the most helpful person by far. All of the serves were rude and acted almost like they were doing us a favor. They were not helpful about questions regarding the menu, so if you're new to Japanese food don't go here first, However the food did come out in a timely manner. I will never visit this place again nor can I recommend them.
Yuqing L.}New York, NY}60}260}670}18}4}7/21/2015}Came here twice so far. Last time was one year ago. In that visit, this place didn't impress me much. I only remembered the location was so hard to find.This time, came here with another girl friend and surprisingly I love the food we ordered! We ordered grilled squid, cod fish, ox tail, taro eggplant, egg omelette, etc. they were all pretty good! We walked in for weekday dinner and directly got seated. But I heard this place is all packed on weekends. So make sure you reserve first for weekends if you don't want to wait forever.
Audrey T.}New York, NY}1}164}4}18}4}7/21/2015}Sakagura is a really cute Japanese place that's a little hidden because it's on the basement floor of a building. We got there at 6pm once it opened to ensure that we could get a table since it was fully booked. The decor is really cute, and the food was great as well. Our table shared a number of dishes such as the fried potato balls, fried chicken, tuna with yams, beef, and onigiri. I just have to say that the onigiri was not worth it because it was 95% rice and then a little bit of salmon on top. I highly recommend the fried chicken, and potato balls. For dessert we got the black sesame creme brulee which was amazing, and then some other cake that was not memorable. Overall, nice experience and I would come back.
Shulin T.}Financial District, Manhattan, NY}22}238}402}18}3}7/19/2015}Impressed I was with the onsen tamago, which was served in a slightly chilled savory broth packed with a generous amount of uni and ikura. That was probably the best part of the meal for me. Also delightful was the prawn in an almond ball as i enjoyed the texture and nuttiness of it. However, I wasn't that amped about the fried chicken and hot stone beef that people rave about so much on Yelp. Th e quality of the sushi rice also left much to be desired.
Justin C.}Manhattan, NY}226}25}83}-1}4}7/14/2015}First time dining out, which is located right next to Soba Totto. This place is really hidden downstairs in the basement under a corporate building. We tried the Soba beer for the first time and it was very tasty! Didn't require a reservation, just walked in on a Tuesday night. Overall, place wasn't that packed but food did take a decent amount of time to come. Food was great. Service was great but just took a little while for employees to get our check and split the bill etc etc.
Manfred S.}Medford, MA}88}648}151}18}4}7/14/2015}Weekend in the city, desperate for some good food, Yelp saved the evening. It is great to find a good Izakaya in NYC. Now we need something like this in Boston. Sashimi combo would almost be competitive in Tokyo. Agedashi tofu was very nice. The special sake of the night: unfiltered, unpasteurized dai gin jo --- I didn't know that this was possible in the US.Also, the staff was very professional and friendly.
Rosetta S.}Brooklyn, NY}1}127}0}-1}5}7/12/2015}I love this place soooo much. Never had a bad experience here! Recently, I went with a friend and we drank the most delicious, spicy sake. It was oak barrel aged and dry and delicious. Aside from that, be adventurous and order the squid in squid liver. It is a small dish of raw squid in a "liver soup", so to speak. Very briny and tasty with the sake we had. The cold duck with basil sauce is always a winner and the daikon salad with roe and spicy mayo is also delish. Can't wait to go back!
Nicolle P.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}3}7/11/2015}Just to be clear this is NOT a sushi place - none!  But it comes up in sushi searches on Yelp, so don't be misled.   Menu seemed limited.  Ambience was nice BUT tricky to find, since the restaurant is actually in the basement of the business building.  The security guard will help you find it once you wind up actually going into the building.  I walked by two times and then called the restaurant to help me find the place.
Dianne P.}New York, NY}4}6}302}-1}3}7/11/2015}I am not sure of all the hype.  I think this is just an average Japanese spot.  Here's what we ordered and my thoughts:1. Ika Shiokara sliced raw squid cured in salt and a squid liver marinade --- first time having this dish.  I've eaten lots of squid in my life but never had squid liver which is probably what really threw me off on the taste.  It has very sharp fishy taste.2. Maguro Tartar chopped tuna with flying fish roe and steeped in yuzu and caviar --- I think having a fish roe kind of ruined what I expect from this dish because it made it fishy when a good tartare has this very nice smooth and subtle taste.  Morimoto's tuna tartare is the best so far I've had!3. Yuba Shumai minced pork dumpling with shrimp and lotus roots wrapped in a thinly bean curd sheets served with "ponzu "japanese citrus sauce --- It is what you would expect.  I didn't like how the wrap is so thin that it easily comes off and you're left with a big thick ball of meat.4. Gyu Miso Nikomi shredded beef back ribs stewed in miso topped with grated daikon radish --- This is their best dish and what I would highly recommend!  The beef was just cooked perfectly that it melts in your mouth and all the other stuff with it just complements the texture and the taste so well.5. Sake Oyako Don fillets of fresh salmon sashimi and salmon roe steeped in soy sauce served atop a bowl of rice (served with miso soup) --- this is my typical go to and they have a decent serving of it.  This doesn't deviate from how any other Japanese restaurants would serve it.6. Black sesame dessert (I apologize for not remembering the name) --- my boyfriend thought this was "f*cking amazing" and I was indifferent.Nonetheless, the ambiance was very cozy and I really loved the service.  Also they have a really good sake selection and i think it's a nice spot to hang after work hours with friends or coworkers.
Min Z.}New York, NY}1}6}0}-1}1}7/11/2015}Been here many times after work.  This was the first time for lunch.  This lunch visit just wiped out all the love I had for this place.  The service was horrible!!!  It was good that the waitress told us certain dishes were sold out when we sat.  But how horrible is it to take our order, come back to tell us that there was not enough supply to fulfill our order (we order multiple of the same lunch sets) and then to come back again and say someone took whatever we ordered and you have to order something else.  Common sense would dictate you put the order in for what is availe.  Then the waitress screwed up the order again and two members of our party had to wait another twenty minutes.  Asking for the check took another five to ten minutes and it was also wrong.  They put on more stuff on the receipt than we ordered.  Tired of the waitress I ran up to the boss lady at the cashier and she made me wait even longer to confirm my order.  After confirmation she was absolutely unapologetic and gave me a revised bill.  With all the service issues you would think she would offer a discount or at least apologize.  I didn't get either.  This is quite the shame since I discovered that place over a decade ago and loved going back.  Not anymore.
Kevin L.}New York, NY}5}196}0}-1}4}7/7/2015}Authentic, high-quality Japanese food. It's in the basement of the building, and may be hard to find, but when I went there, a doorman at the entrance pointed us in the right direction. It's a great place to go for a date because it's somewhat of a hidden gem.
Mike C.}Dyker Heights, NY}7}20}0}-1}4}7/6/2015}Very good spot for lunch. Food is awesome. The only bad thing is the selection is limited as opposed to the dinner menu.
elena l.}Oakland, CA}16}14}2}-1}1}7/2/2015}I give one for the waiter I give one for the pricey restaurantI give one because even though the food ( very little portions) was good ( not VERY GOOD), , a sashimi plate with 15 pieces costs 53 $ and because the waiter would not help us or recommend us food considering the guests - 4 adults with 3 kids- I usually love giving good reviews and love good quality for a fair price or even more expensive price but I will definitely not repeat the experience There are lots of great sushi places in New York
Yuko H.}Fountain Hills, AZ}597}1297}3406}18}4}7/2/2015}Great izakaya style restaurant with so many selection of sake. They even have certified sake connoisseur.I ordered Kubota manjyu from Nigata prefecture. The area is known for quality rice and clean water, sake from Kubota is consistently excellent. So smooth and easy to drink, I had to slow down so I don't get drunk. Service was great! Very attentive and knowledgable server was always nearby to take additional orders from us throughout the night.We probably ordered 15 different appetizers and all were good, just like food in Japan. I especially liked chicken served side of yuzu kosho. Yuzu complimented juicy chicken.To end the dinner, we each ordered teuchi soba (homemade soba they made from scratch). Very rare to find those kind of soba, I only know a few other restaurants that make own soba in U.S.Desert was amazing too. Not too sweet, just like what they serve in Japan.Nice decor inside, I felt like I was somewhere in Tokyo.Highly recommend for reservations as they were busy on weekday nights.
Hung T.}Manhattan, NY}62}14}21}-1}5}6/29/2015}People are not kidding when they say this place is hidden; it's literally in the basement level of a large corporate building. Reservations were made a day in advance for 2 at the bar, however, the host could not find us in the system; this was eventually rectified (waited perhaps 10 minutes) and we were seated in a small table in the backroom. There is a huge assortment of sake, and various cold and hot dishes. Had a cold sake on the recommendation of the waiter - not sure what it was called, but it did come in a nicely decorated bucket of ice. I had the following: -Onsen Tamago - a cold soup consisting of poached egg, uni, and salmon roe. Absolutely delicious. The broth is just the right, and pairs well with the toppings. -Buta Kakuni - braised pork belly. Perfectly seasoned and tender. -Gyutan Yawaraka Ni - stewed beef tongue with daikon radish, taro, and spinach. Divine - best dish of the night. -Snow crab rice in rice with miso soup (for 2) - a nice dose of carbohydrates following multiple plates of protein -Black sesame creme brûlée with ice cream - a unique dessert item that takes me back to the traditional Cantonese desserts of my youth (eg black sesame pudding) but with a cripy twist.-Mango pudding - a tarty/sweet finish to a great meal Would most definitely come again. Various reviewers have commented on the so-so sashimi, so the focus for me was on all non-sashimi based dishes; all dishes were fantastic.
Sofia S.}Brooklyn, NY}117}106}194}-1}5}6/28/2015}Came here for Valentine's Day dinner with my boo. The place was a bit more casual than we expected but there were plenty of people dressed fancy as well. They didn't try to scam us with a special Valentine's Day menu. It was just their normal food. We sat in the back room which had room dividers, providing privacy for a nice romantic mealSake- a TON of options. We didn't know what to pick- waitress did an ok job helping us decide, we ended up going with a special and another random sake that's served in a square bowl for the fun of itFood- salmon bowl was great. The roe was delicate and not too fishy. The salmon fatty. Rice was well cooked and everything was served at perfect temperature - hot stone beef was great. Fun to cook yourself and well marinated but it got really smoky- duck was pretty bland. Could do without it - creme brûlée and chocolate cake were both unbelievable. The creme brûlée had a black sesame flavor which I didn't want to end
Yang D.}London, United Kingdom}41}84}405}-1}4}6/26/2015}A hidden gem in the basement, nothing stops it gets very full. Love the most of food, restaurant is with character. I wasn't able to find a very special dish but It was generally very good.  Should go next time to try some sake ;)
Jenny H.}San Francisco, CA}352}456}642}-1}3}6/26/2015}In my ever growing NYC weekend to-do list, one thing stayed at the top of mine: to have an amazing sushi dinner. This proved challenging when you pair a sushi enthusiast, such as myself with a sashimi-aversed friend. After much research on Yelp, we made a reservation at Sakagura. True to the review articles, Sakagura features an extensive sake list to pair with an elegant "tapas"/Izakaya style menu. It seemed fitting that I could get the sushi omakase while my friend had her pick of other items.Contrary to other reviews, my omakase sushi was mediocre at best. While very instagram-glam, most of my cuts were rather tendonous. The uni-- my generously small bowl of uni would seem like I'd hit ocean gold. Again, don't let first glances fool you. Beneath the overlay of two full pieces were very dubiously dirty smushed ones that shouldn't have been served. Respect the uni!All of our hot items such as my chawanmushi (steamed egg custard), plus my friend's ebi roll and seafood rice were well received. Both of us picked something sweet to end the meal. Dessert is non-neogotiable at Sakagura and definitely not something to pass up.In the style of true Japanese dining, if I wanted good sushi, I'd go to a sushi restaurant. If I wanted good ramen, go to a ramen-ya. Skip the sushi at Sakagura and all will be well.
Karen P.}New York, NY}0}11}15}-1}5}6/25/2015}I absolutely loved this place. Great food, reasonable price, nice decor and amazing service. I came here for lunch (at about 11:40, ten minutes after it opens) and ordered the special of the day (chicken with tartar sauce and cold soba). It was absolutely delicious with a huge food portion. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it all, but I did! The tea they served was nice and warm in a cute little cup. I would definitely come back here again. I would advise anyone who wants the daily special to arrive early because I overheard the waiter telling the people next to us that they had already ran out of two of their three specials of the day within one hour of its opening. Another tip: if you are coming here later, make a reservation! I found that they give the nicer located tables to the people who had made a reservation.
Chris H.}Roswell, GA}192}9}2}-1}5}6/25/2015}People are not lying when they tell you that this place is hidden. I almost went into the other Japanese restaurant on street level, but then saw the small sign for Sakagura. After the adventure of finding the place, the food was worth it. I don't know much about Sake and the server gave me a great feel of what to order. I got the Salmon Shashmi over rice + Miso Soup. The prices are pretty decent considering you are in NYC. I would highly recommend it.
Gina M.}New York, NY}78}167}38}18}5}6/24/2015}This place is very hidden, inside an office building, down a flight of stairs. It looks a little creepy before you actually get inside, but once you do, it is amazing!I came here on a Monday night around 7-it was crowded but we were able to get seated after waitng only a few minutes.We shared 4 small plates for 2 people--and that was the perfect amount of food.The black cod was amazing! We also had the eggplant dish with 3 kinds of eggplant which was really good as well. The chicken meatballs were good but not phenomenal, and the sweet potato fried dumplings were basically fried dough so I wouldnt recommend.They have a very extensive sake and plum wine menu as well--we got a half cafafe of plum wine which was delicious.Overall a great experience with really good, authentic food! I would return!
Jasmine W.}New York, NY}621}162}692}18}5}6/23/2015}This restaurant is REALLY hidden. If you have no idea what you're looking for, you'll never see it. You have to go into a corporate building and down the stairway near the security desk in order to find this place. But once you do find it, it's like being transported to Japan.My immediate reaction when I entered the restaurant is that there is a strong fishy smell, which is slightly deterring. That means the fish they have isn't that fresh. I didn't notice it after a while and I didn't order any fish, so no problem for me.I came here on a Friday night and managed to get a same day reservation at 6:15 for 2 (doors open at 6). We sat at the bar, which boasts many varieties of sake. The restaurant was about 1/3 full, but I'm sure there were plenty of tables being held for reservations.We started off with the sake suggested by the waiter. It was the special of the day and we got the casket for $35. The sake was poured in this beautiful casket with the center hollowed out for flowers. After the waiter poured us some sake, he put it back in a little basket filled with ice and other greens. Absolutely adorable.We ordered the agedashi tofu (~$9). The tofu was so incredibly silky but the outside was firm and fried. And when you doused it in the sauce, it became so tasty and soft.Next was the beef. I'm unsure of the name, but basically it was pieces of raw beef served with a really hot stone and a slab of fat for cooking. I think it was the special of the day for $25. You use the fat to rub onto the stone to oil it and then you cook your own beef. It's served with a sauce and some salt (?). I really enjoyed this dish because I loved how you could cook the beef to how you like it. My only complaint was that the portion could have been larger. We also had the Tori Karaage (~$9-10), which is essentially Japanese fried chicken. It strongly reminded me of Taiwanese popcorn chicken, but I'm sure the spices are different. It was crunchy, hot, and savory, and overall delicious.Lastly, we had the black sesame creme brulee ($9), which was definitely my favorite. It's topped with ice cream and a cookie and was really amazing. It combined creamy, warm, cold, and crunchy all in one. I could've kept eating it for ages.My only negative comment would be the fishy smell when you first walk in. But otherwise, this was a wonderful experience and would love to come back!
Jay B.}Manhattan, NY}2}5}4}-1}5}6/20/2015}Tremendous food. Good atmosphere. Good service. Difficult to find, since you need to walk through what looks like an office building lobby before finding a poorly marked door in the elevator bank, which leads to a staircase that finally leads you to the restaurant... but this is why it's a "hidden gem," and definitely adds to the allure of the place.The three dollar signs rating designated to Sakagura is accurate - it can get a bit pricey, especially if you're ordering sake along with a meal. All the dishes are small, so when my wife and I go we order multiple plates. For example, we recently went with another couple, so we ordered nine plates to share for the four of us, which was the perfect amount.Favorites include the chicken meatballs w/ teriyaki sauce, the mashed potatoes coated in sweet donut batter fried crisp, and my personal favorite, the beef tongue stewed in a miso served with slices of daikon radish.
lemon j.}Manhattan, NY}0}21}0}-1}2}6/19/2015Updatedreview}Last time I went here there was hair in two of the dishes and the overall quality had dropped significantly. There are now many other places in town that serve superior Japanese food.
Elisha T.}Bellevue, WA}128}111}164}-1}5}6/18/2015}Two of us went here the first time on Thursday night. We didn't make a reservation so we had to wait about 30 minutes before we get seated. We were excited to try this place because of the high rating on Yelp and we wanted something good even at higher cost.- Sashimi Omakase was amazing. Every piece of fish were really fresh and taste. I love sea urchin so that was a huge plus.- Tuna tar tar is a classic yet full of a creative presentation- Carafe Tendorigawa Yamahai Sake was very tasty, it was promoted as a new selection on the menu- Agedashi tofu is another classic menu, good taste- Pacific oyster was fine but wasn't as impressed as other menu items I had- Nihachi Soba was great, you can taste the difference in noodle compared to other places which simply serve store bought noodleThe bill came around $145 for two and it was worth it for a special night.
Amy Y.}New York, NY}30}107}392}-1}4}6/13/2015}Love their daily lunch special!  Although I didn't get a chance to get their special.  Instead I got the sake ikura don set. It was very filling.  The cold soba was so delicious.
Jit B.}Manhattan, NY}40}44}14}-1}3}6/11/2015}There is a Thrill associated with finding this place .. because its a SECRET location and unless you know where it is .. I can promise that you wont be able to find it even with Google Maps !! (Probably why Anthony Bourdain showed this place in one of his shows!)Location: As you walk on 43rd .. from 3rd towards 2nd av, you will find luke's lobster on the left and a Japanese Ramen house beside that... and although the map will show that you have reached the address .. but there will be NO SIGN of this place !! ... so you will have to look carefully and will see that the address takes you in front of the entrance of a building beside Luke's .. enter through the doors .. there is security .. Yet NO SIGN of this place .. ask security and he will show you to the elevators .. that will take you to the basement and then as you come out of the elevator ... you still have to look for a tiny sign on the door that further takes you to a stairway down.... and then you come to this beautifully wood decorated place...Food:I think its over priced and here is why - The quality is great , yet at per with $$ Japanese places in the city. The quantity is a bit less than most of the $$ places. In terms of the food .. you will enjoy it ONLY if you like hard-core Japanese food lover - Soba, Donburi bowls, etc. Remember this is NOT a Ramen house. They do have an excellent collection of Sakes and you can even go for a Sake tasting order.The service :The waiters are attentive and very courteous (like most Japanese places) .. but they are slow. So if you are in a hurry .. may be re-consider.I have tried this place twice, since its just a block from my work ... and the only time I was disappointed was when I took the hot Kamo Namban. It was .. .. below average- felt like a bunch of noodles put in a bowl of hot water and Soy sauce mix. But then at other time , I have tried their Donburi bowl , and that was pretty good ..So overall - good Japanese food for a hardcore Japanese food lover .. little over priced .. and a tad slow service ..
Ji P.}Manhattan, NY}183}86}0}-1}5}6/10/2015}What Can I say?My best experience of Japanese food so far. Food, Decor and Service are all above normal. I highly recommend everyone to try all the dishes on their menu. Almost none of them have disappointed me. And the Sake they have can make anyone start to appreciate Japanese Alcohol.
Rachel H.}Albany, NY}9}122}16}-1}5}6/10/2015}As good an oyako don as I've had anywhere. Lovely decor. Quick service. I came at 11:45 and the place was almost empty. By 12:30 there were probably 10 people waiting to be seated. To find it: go in the building, past the reception desk. There is a door to the left that looks like a utility door but it has the symbol for the restaurant on it. Go in, down the stairs, down the hall, and you will find the restaurant!
Jon P.}New York, NY}1}40}0}-1}3}6/10/2015}Sakagura is a useful place and I'm glad that it exists.  In a neighborhood full of overpriced and/or unpleasant eateries, it offers a reasonable experience at a reasonable cost.  I recognize that running a decent restaurant in midtown Manhattan must be very challenging and appreciate that Sakagura pulls that off capably, if not with panache.That said, I don't expect the moon and the stars here.  The cooking is competent, and the portions are adequate, but the taste and quality don't stand out in any way.  put another way, the food is distinctly average.  I believe they used to offer sushi, but as of June 2015 they seem only to offer a limited range of sashimi; most of the food is cooked, such as various types of soba.  Sake is the specialty here, but since I'm not a sake drinker I cannot comment on the selection or its price/quality relationship.The service is responsive and unobtrusive in the restaurant, but the reservation desk is demanding.  They phoned me less than two hours before my reservation and left a message telling me to "please be careful" and not arrive more than 10 minutes late because in that event my reservation would be canceled.  Not exactly tactful, but I understand where they're coming from.The space feels surprisingly open and comfortable given its subterranean situation.  There is some crowding among the tables but I've seen significantly higher density of table arrangements in many other restaurants.  The noise level is manageable.Sakagura is serviceable, not stellar.  If you go with that mind set, you should be reasonably contented with your meal and experience.
Funglin W.}New York, NY}793}444}59}-1}3}6/9/2015}A bit pricey, but definitely worth trying and a great date spot! I loved the atmosphere - really felt like I was at a restaurant in Japan. The sake selections are impressive and it's interesting that it's in the basement of a business building.The one thing I didn't like was when we asked the server for sake and food recommendations, she would always recommend us the most expensive items :( Now, for two people, I would recommend 1 cold app, 4 hot apps, 1 sake, and a dessert. That was how much my friend and I had and it was a good amount. Here were our orders: Seaweed salad with sesame dressing (5): probably my favorite dish of the night. The dressing was so delicious and I love all the variety of seaweed there it is. It's also a great portion for two to shareButa Kakuni (5): The best hot apps of the night. Order 1 per person! It's this extremely nice fatty part of the pork soaked in a strong yet light flavored broth. The meat was so tender and it was a great end to our meal.Ebi Stick (3): Flavors were great but the shrimp was slightly overfriedSanshoku Nasu Dengaku (4): I'm not a huge fan of eggplant, but if you do like the texture of eggplant then you will love this dish. It's a total of 6 slices of eggplant which 3 different sauce on them to try. The miso sauce was a bit overpowering but loved the other two sauce.Saikoro Steak (3): Sliced steak with grated onion. This was the dish recommended by the server and although it was a bigger size portion than the others, it was really expensive and not as good in flavor. The beef was slightly overcooked and the sauce wasn't anything too special.Black sesame creme brulee (5): SO GOOD! Must end the meal with this desert!
Van N.}Los Angeles, CA}243}323}420}18}4}6/9/2015}This place was recommended by a friend. It is located in an office building downstairs, pass the reception desk and it's on the left, the sign is grey and letters are grey so it's hard to find. We made lunch reservations for 3 but came early to see if there's any available since we were finish sight seeing earlier than expected. We got scolded by the receptionist for not coming at our designated time, not canceling/modifying the reservation earlier, and stating they gave us a call earlier to confirm and we didn't address it then. Nonetheless, it was a 15-30 minute wait. As for food, we were debating getting the lunch special, everyday it's different donburi and dry homemade noodles for $11. Instead our group got the salmon bowl $18 which came with miso soup, they put some sort of spice that turned it red, not great. The salmon was good quality but was not proportional to the rice, we had so much leftover that we felt it was expensive for what we got. My other friend got the preset courses for $33. The first course was a fresh sashimi. Second was the small portion of homemade noodles in soup-simple but delicious. Third, a 3 tier plate tempura shrimp, etc, fish, and steak in sauce. The course also came with dessert, you can pick any from their menu it was normally $8 bucks so you get value by doing this option. All the food in the courses was great. Overall, we received great service. I love the ambiance and feel of the place and prices weren't terrible for lunch.
Marc C.}Hawthorne, NY}20}29}2}-1}5}6/9/2015}Quick facts:  - Good tapas style food - Service is good - Most likely want to reserve - Time limit on the table (around 3 hours so good but don't think you'll be there all night) - Figure between $100 to $150 per couple with a drink or two and dessert.I went on a Monday night with my wife to meet friends.  We arrived much earlier then expected (around 6:15) and without reservation were told it was probably better to take a table now (meeting friends at 7) and that we'd have the table till 9.  The decor and ambiance of the place is nice.  Kind of a hidden underground restaurant.  Staff is polite knowledgeable and friendly.  Their Saki list is beyond impressive and if you don't know anything about Saki the waiter does so don't fear.  Selection is pretty good.  Portion size is on the smaller tapas size.  I'd recommend ordering about 3 items per person (as the waiter recommended.)  We also ordered a rice bowl side ($2) each.  Weirdly the rice came on the later half of the meal which is a little weird since you'd want to enjoy it along all the food.  The sesame Crème brûlée was excellent.  Just good fresh food in a nice environment.
Alison L.}Atherton, CA}101}592}56}18}4}6/4/2015}This is the greatest value for lunch in midtown if you are looking for a sit-down lunch (the three dollar signs $$$ are misleading, as it is expensive for dinner). Their daily lunch special is $11.50, so with tax and tip, it comes out to about $15 dollars.  Their Thursday special is Chirashi Don. It comes with soba (hot or cold)--this combined with the large bowl of rice under the chirachi gives you your carbs for the day.  The chirashi itself was ok.  I could have went for less shrimp and more salmon/tuna.  The inside of the restaurant is also very nice.  Light and airy (unlike the stairs that you walk down, don't worry!).  The decor made me feel like I was in a themed restaurant in Disneyland. If you are interested, get there at 11:30 am (when it opens)!  When we walked out around 12:30pm, there was a long line and they were sold out of their daily lunch special.
Roxanne S.}Manhattan, NY}1}21}2}-1}4}6/4/2015}Disclaimer: I'm not Japanese but I've lived there before, visit regularly and speak just enough Japanese to be dangerous, so this might bias my review a bit.I ate here for lunch by myself at the counter. I had a reservation at 11:30 and I arrived 5 minutes before; there was already a line when I got there, and the restaurant filled up very quickly. At first it was quiet enough for me to read a book (no cell phone service here since it's in the basement!) but by the time I left it was quite noisy.I ordered the jewel oke bento and it was delicious - there's a little bit of everything so there's bound to be something in there you like.  My favorite part was probably the tamagoyaki which had a bit of octopus in it (not what I was expecting!) I got a free sampling of the monthly sake special because I'm an ANA mileage club member - this month was Kinoega Yuuga Junmai Ginjo from Chiba. I'm not a sake connoisseur but it tasted pretty good to me. For dessert I ordered the pear millefeuille with earl grey ice cream at the recommendation of the bartender and it was amazing - probably the most delicious dessert I've ever had at an izakaya.The service was all right. My bartender didn't talk to me much but friendly enough - he seemed more focused on the regulars (which you could tell were regulars because of the stamp card.) Kinda miffed that no one greeted me as I left the restaurant (any Japanese restaurant worth their salt would have their waitstaff say "arigatou gozaimashita" when guests leave) but eh, this is New York, ain't nobody got time for that, I suppose.Maybe my expectations were set too high since my friends kept telling me how great this place was but overall I felt slightly disappointed? It was good and I'd definitely come back again, but it wasn't the "true Tokyo experience" that others were making it out to be.
Audrey -.}Manhattan, NY}88}58}0}-1}4}6/4/2015}They have great lunch specials and definitely get the black sesame ice cream.The restaurant's located in the basement of an office building. It's the perfect place to grab lunch (if you have time to spare) or an after work dinner. My advice is to make a reservation online as there is almost always a line. The food is always amazing but the service can be a little spotty-we had to ask for the check three times at lunch once.
Clara F.}Brooklyn, NY}0}11}0}-1}4}6/3/2015}Very decent price and very decent food for this Midtown East staple. I got the donbury + soba set for $13.50 and I couldn't finish it! The best option when you have to catch a train or have a business lunch in the City!
Adrien M.}Manhattan, NY}7}48}2}-1}5}6/3/2015Updatedreview}Try their takeaway shop in the back of the lobby upstairs, Kiosku.
Julie O.}Phoenix, AZ}31}183}68}18}4}6/1/2015}Came here with two coworkers and husband. I had the soba noodles with veggies, coworker #1 had soba salad and coworker #2 and partner had a large platter of sashimi (Jewel). Acoustics are wonderful with music and light conversation. Portions are filling and variety is excellent. Quality is superb and understandable why this place is a lovely secret. For dessert, we ordered two chocolate souffles and a black sesame creme brulee. I loved the creme brulee. It had a nice layer of black sesame paste at the bottom, thoroughly mixed into the custard and deliciously baked into the accompanying crisp. The custard wasnt too sweet but well enough to balance the texture of the sesame. Wonderful place that I'll return to again!
Sheila P.}Manhattan, NY}1}8}5}-1}4}6/1/2015}Sea Urchin Soba is the dish that brings me back to Sakagura every now and then. It's made with buckwheat noodles topped with fresh sea urchin and the waitress pours the sea urchin soup over the dish for you once it's brought to the table. Another recommendation is the Kaisen Don, fresh sashimi topped over lightly flavored rice. I suggest making a recommendation for both lunch/dinner because it gets super busy throughout the day!
Alessandro M.}London, United Kingdom}0}11}0}-1}5}6/1/2015}This restaurant is an absolute gem! Food is a very fine expression of japanese culinary culture! Taste is unique and the presentation is superb! Staff is friendly and prices are fair!
Ying L.}New York, NY}201}89}0}-1}5}5/31/2015}Sakagura is where we had our second date.*Where we had responsibly shared a single carafe of wine on our first date, this time, we got ridiculously, aggressively, comically, drunk.So anyway, we met in front of Sakagura. It's in a very ugh part of town, midtown east. I remember approaching the spot and seeing him leaning against the streetlight in his white polo shirt and khaki shorts like some sort of preppy pied piper.I was wearing black leather combat boots, grey acid-washed jeans, an oversized asymmetrical hoodie, and my school backpack.We were like two enemy chess pieces, meeting covertly off-the-board to discuss a possible armistice despite our bloodthirsty generals.We go in and order some sake. I'd furtively eaten a cream cheese bagel on a park bench right before, because we were meeting for "drinks" at dinner time and I'm the rare bird on this island that actually likes to eat three meals a day.Anyway, the conversation went like this:him: So, how's school?me: It's ok.him: So, how's life?me: It's ok.Hehe. I don't know. Then I grabbed the mic and started asking the questions. Because I was never socialized properly into society, my questions went like this:me: Do you want to die by fire or drowning or buried alive?him: Drowning.me: Lame.me: Would you move to the jungle if it had great wifi?him: I guess so...me: Wrong, the insects would kill you.It continued like this until he got drunk to escape me, a trend that has carried on to this very day. I didn't think I was drunk until I caught myself leering at my reflection in the mirror with a knowing smile when I was washing my hands in the washroom. That's when I knew I was a little sauced up too.We played a little "guess what those people over there are about" but it was not too stimulating. Everyone there was obviously a 37-year-old office worker relaxing over drinks with co-workers before taking a commuter train home.After a few rounds of drinks, he said, "Want to order food?"I said I was not hungry.The other thing is that I had planned to go to a Danish house party later that night. Our first date had been short, so I'd assumed this date would be short, too.But I realized that I liked how he took my questions seriously, mulled over them respectfully, so I invited him to come to the Danish house party with me.Outside on the sidewalk, we were shy and formal again. We hopped into a cab and sped towards the East Village.It was our first time in a motor vehicle together. I pointed out my favorite street meat vendor spots. He blanched at "street meat" but that's what I still call it to this day. It is meat that you eat in the street: street meat.Anyway, before we went to the Danish house party, we decided to get some more drinks at DGBG first. I don't recall how that came to be. To wash down the sake?I had a martini. He had a martini.Next, I remember walking against traffic up Bowery. There's that soft spring wind that swirls around at night like you're being caressed by ghosts. My boots stomping with unnecessary assertiveness. Maneuvering around orange plastic construction pylons and drunks gathering their things in the backseat of impatient cabs, ready to pick up new fare.I'm leading the way. He's behind me. Or maybe it's the other way around. Doesn't matter. We are equal partners in crime snaking through all the lovely detritus of a warm Friday night.And even though there is no mirror in front of me this time, I catch myself smiling again.*If you want to start at the beginning, go here: yelp.com/biz/bar-jamón-n…
John C.}Sandy, UT}451}649}4249}18}3}5/26/2015}Found out about this place from Anthony Bourdain, sometimes you don't know when to trust him as he always says "oh yeah this is good" at every place he visits. We had to make a reservation and the web site said business casual and everyone was in shorts but us. oh well, better luck next time on a 81 degree day.We ordered the Memorial day meal and the lunch tasting course. Every thing was going well, food was coming out on time, flavor was spot on, and then the well done beef filet steak came out which I ordered medium. We were left alone waiting for 30 minutes until I asked the bus boy to help me get a new steak. Finally our original server came over to bring the steak and I asked him if he forgot about us? He was trying to apologize but I wasn't in the mood to hear a "sorry".Anyway the food was great! Especially the black cod that tasted wonderful. The sashimi was delightful, the home made soy sauce was just right. The buckwheat (handmade soba) noodles were excellent as well. The thick chunk of tofu was store bought and didn't taste that good.To finish off the great meal we had green tea ice cream.Wouldn't mind trying this place out again, probably need a different server as it wasn't busy at all right when they opened.
Snow K.}New York, NY}11}18}13}-1}4}5/21/2015}like the black cod fish there. Location is kind of hard to find. Mango pudding is good as usual!
Serena H.}Flushing, NY}1}4}1}-1}5}5/20/2015}came here for lunch. The uni soba is soooo good! The lunch special tasting is awesome too.
Kate C.}Flushing, NY}2}19}101}-1}3}5/20/2015}This place was okay. It was not that great than I expected. Locationwise, it's pretty good because it is right at the Grand Central station. But I don't think I will go back here soon. I would rather go to Udon west which is also at Grand Central and provides more cheaper and better menus than here.
Lacey F.}Brooklyn, NY}21}22}71}-1}3}5/19/2015}If there were half stars, 3.5 would have been perfect.  Very fun ambiance for a group of friends.  Tucked away in the basement, you would completely forget that you had entered a corporate building in the first place. The majority of the menu is a lost of cold and hot appetizers, tapa sized.  You would have to order multiple to fulfill your tummies.  I would recommend the uni soba with uni soup however I had better at sobaya (uni , mountain yam, soba) and sakamai.  The rest of the appetizers were okay, none of which I would specifically return for.  Desserts were amazing, sesame creme brulee, pancotta, earl gray and green tea ice cream were all delicious.  Service was great, staff were very nice.  I agree with other reviewers that the food wasn't quite 4 star food.
Yuma O.}Boston, MA}20}16}22}-1}4}5/13/2015}This is first time for me. There are a lot of kinds of Japanese sake. And you can eat Japanese Izakaya foods. Tastes are good. Especially gyusujinikomi is pretty good.
Cathleen K.}Manhattan, NY}0}15}0}-1}5}5/12/2015}Great authentic Japanese restaurant/bar in the basement of an office building right across the street from Sushi Yasuda. This place has a large variety of sake and has a ton of great small bites. Loved everything and the vibe. Perfect for date night, groups, and to impress out of towners!
Kevin C.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}5/10/2015}Great place to have Japanese food. But the place is a little hard to find. It's in the basement of 211 E43 Street. Just walk in the lobby and go into the first door. The food is very fresh there. Will come again with friends.
Lala I.}Los Angeles, CA}231}203}0}-1}5}5/10/2015}if you love sake, sakagura is a must visit in new york city. their one of a kind drink menu consists of over 200 kinds of carefully selected sakes.ive never seen such an extensive sake list so i was overwhelmed. my friend and i wanted something bubbly and refreshing, so i picked the mio sparkling sake and it was outstanding. very fruity, soft and smooth, exactly what we were looking for.the food did not disappoint either. everything we ordered was delicious and very well made.the atmosphere was very laid back, but the service was def on point and attentive: we were given an "Oshibori" (wet towel) to clean their hands with and our glasses were never empty.sakagura is probably my favorite izakaya in nyc right now. it is located in a basement. no cellphone signal so you wont get distracted by the outside world. just relax and enjoy the sake, food, and your company.
Wei D.}Flushing, NY}2}3}6}-1}5}5/9/2015}One of the must try Japanese restaurant in NYC. Beside fresh sashimi and snow crab meat rice, black sesame ice cream with soy sauce is something you would like to try. Yes, I said soy sauce with ice cream.
Celine L.}Los Angeles, CA}2989}901}4625}-1}3}5/8/2015}Sakagura is located inside a corporate building underground, so it was actually really difficult to find when we first came. After arriving on time for our reservation, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes before we were able to be seated. The restaurant was actually surprisingly big! There was a main dining room with an expansive display of sake, and smaller rooms with more tables. I really liked the decor- there were cherry blossoms on the ceiling as well as a giant mask overlooking the guests. We started out with the onsen tamago- soft boiled egg topped with sea urchin and salmon roe in cold soup ($8). In my opinion, I liked this version better than the one offered at Kyo ya. The soup was a clear thin broth that was the perfect complement to the fish and egg. This appetizer was delicious! We then got Sakagura's special- the stewed diced pork ($6). The pork belly was so tender and the fat was so juicy and succulent... it was definitely a special. We killed this dish within seconds!The gyutan yawaraka ni- miso stew served with beef tongue, daikon radish, taro potato, spinach, and shiitake mushrooms ($14) came out next, and this was a nice hearty dish that was enjoyable. The beef tongue was braised, and was not of the usual consistency that I am used to.We then got the recommended dish- wagyu beef grilled on a hot stone served with ponzu sauce ($25). This dish was seriously underwhelming- minus one star for this. As a recommended dish at the front of the menu, you would expect this dish to be at its best and absolutely fantastic, but boy were we wrong. Although the concept of grilling the beef on a hot stone was cool, the meat quality itself was not what I expected. I asked the server what grade the wagyu was, and she said it was A4. You would expect an A4 to be tender, juicy, and filled with fat, but this was not the case. The meat was SUPER chewy, but there was good flavor. Definitely not what I expected from an A4 wagyu. Super disappointed with this dish. Maybe it was a different cut of the cow? I would not have served this to guests and say this is A4.Last but not least, cold soba noodles with dipping sauce ($12). Can't go wrong with soba noodles, and I loved the texture of this dish.Overall, I really enjoyed the food here with the exception of the wagyu beef. Service was attentive and friendly, and they were very precise on changing silverware and taking away dishes. 4 stars minus 1 for the underwhelming experience of the wagyu on hot stone.
Marjorie U.}West Los Angeles, CA}295}487}14225}18}5}5/7/2015}All the dishes I've tried here was so good! For the quality of the dishes I've eaten I was expecting to pay more but to my surprise it was inexpensive. I'm so happy I discovered this place. Love their food, service and ambiance. I will definitely go back when I'm in New York!
C C.}Gaithersburg, MD}0}8}2}-1}5}5/7/2015}Anthony Bourdain was right. This place is incredible. Good prices, fantastic food, a gorgeous atmosphere and really really helpful and nice servers. I couldn't rave enough about this place. I ordered their Kaisen Don - a sashimi and miso soup combination and was whisked away to a seaside sensation of flavor. An accompanying sake was recommended to me and it paired wonderfully. If you're in downtown NYC and craving some Japanese atmosphere in a sake lover's mecca -- don't skip out on Sakagura.
Diana G.}Brooklyn, NY}127}144}92}18}5}5/1/2015}Had a great experience here. Really enjoyed the ambiance, it felt very private and authentic Japanese. (Ive been to Japan several times) The braised pork stood out the most and was the best Ive ever had. It literally melts in your mouth.  The quality of the flavors in that pork could easily be served at a michelin starred restaurant. The sake selection and pairing was also expansive.
Danessa R.}New York, NY}19}100}83}18}3}4/27/2015}Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh­hhhhhhhhhhhhhhI had a decent meal here. That's it. It took me over a month to get a weekend reservation here and I'm sad to say that I was not impressed.We ordered Kuro Edamame ,Maguro Tartar, Tori Karaage, Black Sesame Creme Brulee for desert and sliced steak from the specials menu. The Black Sesame Creme Brulee is the only dish worth noting because it was damn delicious. It had a very delicate, sweet nutty flavor that you have to experience for yourself. I'd come back (and can only afford to come back) just for this dish hence, the three stars. This place was just way too pricey.
Mark B.}Sydney, Sydney, Australia}22}26}4}-1}3}4/26/2015}Good restaurant in a very neat underground location.  While food is good (stone cooked wagyu beef is exceptional), it is expensive for what you get. Japanese whiskey is excellent but again expensive for a single pour. Staff are friendly.If there were half stars, I'd give Sakagura 3.5 stars.
Jiho S.}New York, NY}66}468}89}-1}5}4/26/2015}One of my top izakayas in Manhattan! Don't be surprised, follow the signs into the basement of this nondescript office building and you'll suddenly find yourself transported into what feels like Japan. The first thing that stood out was the really long bar along the side great for solo diners and couples alike.  Plentiful food and sake options. We tried everything from sushi to stone grilled beef, to braised short ribs. Nothing disappointed. It can get a bit pricey if cost is a consideration. Probably ranks in my top 3 izakayas in the city.
Paul J.}Washington, DC}1}13}0}-1}4}4/25/2015}If there is one word I have to choose for Sakagura, it's excellent.  Said in japanese, "kono isakaya wa totem ii desu ne!"  A friend introduced me to Sakagura while I was in NYC.  The moment I sat down, I knew the food would surpass my expectations.  Just finding it reminded me of my time in Japan.  Off the beaten path, inside on office building, side door, down the basement one flight, and all of sudden you step into a small little oasis of japan.  Irrasshai! Just exactly how I want to feel when I'm going to eat a meal.
Bee G.}New York, NY}0}144}24}-1}5}4/18/2015}So outstanding that I'll have to subtract a star from all my other reviews! Loved the sublime simplicity and deliciousness of their Goma-ae (cold spinach and sesame), Seaweed salad, Nasu Dengaku (grilled eggplant), Tamagoyaki, Uzaku (cold eel and cucumber), and Jidori Shioyaki (crispy-skin chicken). The room is a gorgeous simulation of an old Edo village, and the staff is delightful.
Shushu C.}Los Angeles, CA}277}416}396}18}4}4/16/2015}This place is like a 1 up from Ootoya. I came for the lunch tasting set and it was very delicious. The quality of the food is superb. The lunch tasting set came with sashimi appetizer, soba, (set of tempura, cod and wagyu beef). No complaints whatsoeverI also had the black sesame creme brulee dessert (friend had the pear). I personally liked cha an's better but this place was still good.  I wish I had the stomach to finish it all-I could barely get through the whole thing. I will definitely be coming back here when I can. It is a bit out of the way and hard to find (downstairs of a corporate building) but so oh very worth it. Wish I still worked nearby so I could come for lunch on weekdays.
Vera L.}San Francisco, CA}261}207}326}18}4}4/14/2015}Originally I had wanted the Jewel Bento box for lunch, but they only had a selected number and sold out, so I had to settle for the Sakagura Soba Gozen.  It was still really delicious though.This dish came with a very nice serving of soba noodles of which you can either order hot or cold.  I normally prefer my soba cold but many of the other patrons liked to have soba in a soup form.  They did serve it with some small side dishes, seasonal of course, including tofu, shitake mushrooms, sweet potato, and hijiki seaweed.  Those were really tasty.The sashimi was of course, fresh.  Was it melt in my mouth?  Not compared to my foodgasmic experience at Sushi Yasuda.  However, it does beat a lot of the places in Baltimore and even in Washington D.C.  The portions were great for a moderately light-eater like yours truly. I had to get this dessert as this was the best seller: black sesame creme brulee.  I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar so I got to see how it was made as I sat right in front of the dessert chefs.  One thing that I really dislike about Yelp is that we can't attach pictures to our posts because then it would be easier to reference the foods we are rating.  But take my word for it, this makes for a really healthy and clean lunch, great portions, fresh, and just overall tasty.  I'd definitely come here again for lunch and possibly to try out their dinner menu too!  If you can sit at the bar, I'd highly recommend it.  The chefs and servers as well as the bartenders are so nice and friendly.  It was nice to see some friendly faces in New York City.
Peggy N.}New York, NY}80}64}7}-1}4}4/13/2015}This place is great! When you first arrive to the location, you may get confused. They really take "hidden gem" literally. All you see is an entrance to an office building. You go through the revolving doors, go straight, turn left, and take staircase F downstairs to the restaurant. It's very warm downstairs because it's right by the boiler room in the basement. You'll think you're going into a dungeon, but once you get to the actual restaurant, you'll be so surprised and delighted.I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday this past weekend. The service here at Sakagura is impeccable. They are friendly, efficient, and the recommendations they give out are really helpful. It's really a sake bar, so they have an extensive sake menu and can seem overwhelming with all the choices but our waiter's recommendations to your taste was on point. I had the yuzu sake (yuzuomoi) and it was incredible! I can drink that all day - it was sweet and refreshing.The food is tapas style so we ordered a few dishes to share. Everything we had ordered was delicious. We had the: Tamago Yaki, Kamo Roast, Uni Soba, Tori Tsukune, Gyu Miso Nikomi, Gindara Yuan Yaki, Washyu Ishihara, and for dessert, we had the Pear Millefeuille with Early Grey Ice Cream.
Anders C.}Manhattan, NY}0}8}0}-1}5}4/13/2015}Amazing creative Japanese. Not just sushi. Great desserts.
Chris H.}Manhattan, NY}48}148}9}-1}3}4/11/2015}Exceptionally average traditional izakaya spot. All of the boxes were ticked off appropriately, but with zero flair. If you are looking for an izakaya spot that is just like Japan, come here, but don't expect anything interesting.
Neida G.}Orlando, FL}93}20}7}-1}5}4/9/2015}So much more of an experience than I expected to have for lunch! Location is great, food amazing, so a noodles were perfect.  Make reservations, they are a must!!!
Wendy L.}Taipei, Taiwan}127}104}433}-1}4}4/9/2015}I always forget to write reviews for this place because it's in the basement with absolutely no reception (such a shame for a nice restaurant and i can't share my excitement when I have good food....) But this place is fantastic, almost everything on the menu is good.  The only complaint i have is that it's quite pricy for its portion. I guess that's a common thing for nyc japanese restaurants.
Leah L.}ASTORIA, NY}0}20}6}-1}4}4/7/2015}Me and my sis was here for dinner. Have not try any alcohol. Portions are very small. We ordered 6 plates.Shrimp roll and rice bowl were very good.Ox tail was not so good.Green Tea cream bluee(?) was heavenly tasty!!I want to try their sashimi and kobe beef on sizzling stone!!!!
Xin H.}Jersey City, NJ}0}10}6}-1}5}4/1/2015}very yummy and fresh sashimi！love the desert！we try the lunch tasting Cours and it's so great～
Marvin L.}Santa Monica, CA}29}3}15}-1}3}3/29/2015}Not so friendly service with ok food!  The food is alright but our expectations were much higher after reading the reviews.  I would opt to goto the other restaurant upstair at 1F instead... Better service and more varieties there!
Q T.}Manhattan, NY}25}45}51}-1}5}3/29/2015}I love this place for their desserts.  Truly fabulous.  The sushi, especially the uni, is quite good. Nice sake menu.  The desserts, however, are extraordinary and a must.  I come back all the time just for the desserts.
Jm H.}Jersey City, NJ}46}62}8}-1}4}3/28/2015}Had a nice date night with hubs.  The waygu was soft and tasty like butter.  The uni soba was different than what I imagined...was ok.Get dessert, sooo0 good sesame!
Yihui W.}Manhattan, NY}1}60}0}-1}4}3/28/2015}good place for a date or even for a business lunch--note, no cell reception! it's an unassuming place in an office basement. the food delivers.
Faith D.}Manhattan, NY}7}38}42}-1}4}3/28/2015}Great atmosphere. Traditional japanese style. Choose about 3-4 dishes for two people. Min. $60-70. Small portion. Wouldn't come back though.
Amy K.}Brooklyn, NY}6}75}0}-1}4}3/27/2015}I had been wanting to come to Sakagura for weeks and was finally able to get a seat at the bar without a reservation. I have to admit - I was a bit nervous going in there because of all the hype. I mean, Anthony Bourdain recommends this place - what more could you ask for?Service: Excellent! From when I walked in until when I left, the service was exquisite. My sake and water glasses were never empty. I was checked on several times. The bartender/server gave me several good recommendations. My food came out quickly, and dirty dishes were cleared right away. Drinks: The sake list is extensive! I loooove sake, particularly nigori. While they only have a few nigori options, the bartender was able to recommend a very good, dry one for me. I drank an entire half bottle by myself. Food: You know, I was expecting a bit more in terms of the food. Don't get me wrong - everything I ate was very good, but nothing blew my mind. I guess I had put this restaurant up on a pedestal, and it didn't quite reach that high! The Onseng Tamago (soft boiled egg topped with sea urchin and salmon roe in cold soup) was tasty and had really delicate flavors, but it wasn't extraordinary. The Maguro Tartar was average, and the tuna seemed a little firmer than it should have been. The Yuba Shumai was absolutely wonderful and juicy - this is a must! I also ordered two rice balls - one with salmon and one with salmon roe. I was a bit disappointed that the salmon was cooked (I had expected raw), but it was cooked perfectly nonetheless. The portion of rice to the fish was wayyy too much though! Lastly, I ordered the chocolate soufflé as a dessert, which was scrumptious, soft, and not too overwhelmingly sweet. My neighbors also offered me a taste of the Jaga Dango (mashed potato donuts), which was sooo soft and yummy, especially coated in sugar!Prices: Other than the sake, which cost me a good $40, everything else was pretty reasonably priced in my opinion. The dishes are shareable, "tapas" style, but the portions are actually quite generous. Overall, I enjoyed my entire meal from start to finish. I had expected a bit more, but I still ate good food, drank amazing sake, and left feeling fairly satisfied. It's definitely an experience. Maybe next time I'll branch out and try other things off the menu!
Mike L.}Commack, NY}1}13}0}-1}5}3/26/2015}My girlfriend and I have been waiting to come here for a long time. We arrived without a reservation tonight, and had to wait a few minutes. It was worth it.The restaurant is very nice inside, and has a unique atmosphere. The waiter was nice enough to give us a run down of the menu and how best to order.  Everything we had was delicious. Highly recommend coming here. They also have a vast sake menu, and with the waiter's help, had a delicious glass. Overall, was delicious, and will definitely be returning soon.
Annie C.}Brooklyn, NY}367}123}535}-1}5}3/26/2015}As featured in one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite NYC restaurants, reservations are highly recommended or expect to wait for hours. Sakagura is an underground gem hidden right by Grand Central Terminal. They serve authentic Japanese izakaya dishes which doesn't include sushi. Upon entry, you'll notice their inviting and intimate atmosphere, felt as if I was being transported to Japan. I loved how every single worker spoke fluent Japanese even when their clearly not of Japanese descent. As if I'm not already amazed enough...wait until you see their extensive sake selection. We started off with a carafe of sake that our waiter recommended since we aren't familiar with sake. It wasn't too dry and a bit on the fruitier side which I preferred. It paired well with the dishes that we ordered:TUNA TARTAR -- Topped off with caviar and flying fish roe. I was expecting it to be a bit salty but was instead light, subtle and balanced. Great way to begin our meal. SASHIMI SPECIAL -- It included mackerel, amberjack, red snapper, tuna, and uni. Every piece was super thick and fresh. If you love sashimi, you must order this!UNI SOBA -- Perfectly cooked buckwheat soba topped off with chunks of uni. The uni was amazing. Very sweet and fresh with a hint of brine. The uni soup broth was simply divine! I literally slurped and licked the whole plate clean! Worth every penny for this decadence. HOT STONE WASHU BEEF -- Washu beef slices cooked on a hot stone right in front of you. Cooked 6 secs on each side for the most perfect tender medium-rare slice of beef. Dip it light handily in the soy and sprinkle some sea-salt to add some extra flavor. CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉ -- Yum! Felt as if I was biting on the most fluffy brownie ever. Not overly sweet and pairs perfectly with the vanilla ice cream provided. BLACK SESAME CREME BRÛLÉE -- I LOVEEE black sesame and this was so darn good!! Might be one of the best black sesame desserts I've ever had. Be sure to scoop some of the custard with black sesame crisp to enhance the flavor. It was like an explosion of roasty black sesame in every bite. Can't leave without trying this delightful dessert, you'll regret it!Overall, the service was a bit slow in the beginning but definitely improved throughout the meal. Our waiter was extremely friendly and I never felt rushed at all. Starting from the warm towelettes provided at the beginning to the complimentary green-tea at the end, everything was fantastic. I truly enjoyed every single moment that we spent in this restaurant. I absolutely loved everything that we ordered. All the food was top notch and well-presented. I can't wait to come back, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
JiaJia T.}Hauppauge, NY}409}385}557}18}5}3/24/2015}To get to the restaurant, you have to go down a few steps to the basement.  Inside was a bit cramped where we can easily hear the conversations at the tables next to us.  If you are not claustrophobic and can get used to the efficient use of space, you're in for a treat.I had the soba with mushrooms and veggies.  The soba had the perfect amount of chewiness, and the broth was light yet flavorful.  It was perfect on a cold winter day.  The other dish I tried was a rice bowl topped with tuna tataki and a soft boiled egg.  The dish had a light soy sauce base, and I  couldn't  believe the texture and flavor in that dish with just a few simple fresh ingredients.  Very satisfying lunch indeed.  We'll be back soon!
Jason L.}Gallup, NM}131}125}291}-1}5}3/23/2015}This place is definitely no secret but the restaurant is hidden like one. Sakagura is located in the basement of a building. Once you walk into Sakagura it crazy how the restaurant went from 0 to 100. It feel like you are walking into a restaurant that located in Japan. The quality of all the fish is amazing and the portion is definitely enough for someone to get full off of. From looking at the picture we had to order the Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course. We decided that the Sakagura: Lunch tasting course will be out appetizer. Then we also ordered the Una Don($17.00) and Higawari Set ($11.50).  Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course start off with a appetizer with 5 kinds of sashimi. Then came the main course of assortment tempura (shrimp, white fish and vegetable), Grilled Fish, Beef Fillet Steak, and Cold Handmade Soba. (Cost: $33) The freshest and best tasting sashimi that I have had in NYC. The beef fillet steak was really amazing and something I would just order by itself next time. The shrimp inside the shrimp tempura was huge and not just tempura. I think that the Sakagura: Lunch Tasting Course makes a great appetizer for two so that you can try a large assortment of food. The Una Don was huge! This is probably the first time that I was unable to finish my food at a sushi restaurant. For lunch the Una Don came with a full serving of Eel in a large bowl of rice. The rice and eel was both covered in eel sauce which was amazing and tasty. We also ordered the Higawari Set which was a part of the valentine week special that Sakagura was offering. The service is amazing. The waiter was very attentive and was on point with refilling water and tea. The waiter also informed us on what part of the the sakagura lunch tasting course was placed on the table. I highly recommend this restaurant and I can not wait to come back!
Sue C.}Forest Hills, NY}12}35}0}-1}2}3/23/2015}RUDE!The food here is decent enough. The service is abominable. We had a reservation for 6 people. Because of the number of people in our party, we had a minimum to meet. Not a problem. We met this minimum and then some. We arrived on time for our 6:30pm reservations and had another event to go to at 9pm. We noticed that it was taking quite some time for our food to come out so we ask the servers if they could maybe try expediting our food. Our server said that she had planned to space out our dishes so that we would finish at 9 but said she could push it up to 8:30. Still no problem. Satisfied with our food, we finish on time and get the bill. Smooth sailing still. Here is where we have a problem: While we're waiting for our server to return with our credit cards and receipts, one of the managers or hosts comes to our table to inform us that another party has arrived early and to "please leave now". Um, what? (Mind you, it's still about 8:30pm).1) We didn't get our credit cards back yet, how are you going to ask us to leave?2) Had the server spaced out our dishes to end at 9pm, we would've still been eating. Why do we have to be inconvenienced because the next party arrived early?NEVER in my life have I been asked to leave my table early because another party arrived early for their reservations. What's the point of taking reservations then?The host had mistakenly thought that we had already paid our bill and were just sitting around taking up space. He then realized his mistake and came over to apologize (insincerely, might I add), but the damage had been done. His English was not the best, but there is no way to nicely explain "please leave now". It was completely unnecessary. The food here is good, but overpriced. Save yourself some money and exasperation and go to any of the yakitori joints on St. Marks. None of those places will demand that you leave early because they need your table for a party that arrived earlier than their reservation. And they will all give you excellent service with a smile.
Anna G.}Monroe Township, NJ}2}8}23}-1}1}3/21/2015}I went to sakagura on Valentine's Day and honestly, it wasn't a lot to like about it. Food was pretty average for its  pricing. The room itself located in the basement, I guess, or something, so it's pretty narrow, loud and uncomfortable. We also had to wait for a long time.. So, personally, I don't recommend this place for any sort of special occasion.
Sandra K.}Brooklyn, NY}1}67}0}-1}4}3/21/2015}Small portions, but consistent taste experience throughout. We ordered lots of dishes (not sushi, the cooked dishes) and they weren't too salty or oily. The food didn't really stand out as overwhelmingly great, but the service was good.
Julia Z.}New York, NY}166}292}675}18}5}3/20/2015}Can't go wrong with anything here. I've been here three times and it gets better each time! Most recent dinner for two we ordered: - Watari Bune sake, sweet delicious sake- Onsen Tamago, Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup $9- Maguro Tartar, Chopped Tuna with Flying Fish Roe and Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar $15- Tori Tsukune, Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce $8- Special of the day, soft shell crab rice with miso soup- Gyu Miso Nikomi, Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Daikon Radish $8- Onigiri Rice Balls with Salmon and Salmon Roe $5- Sesame Creme Brulee
Vera W.}Los Angeles, CA}87}16}119}-1}1}3/17/2015}We didn't have a reservation, so went in directly and the front desk told us that the waiting time will be at max of one hour if no one cancelled their reservation, we ended up waiting for two hours with no phone call at all!!! The menu is very limited and the selected sashimi from the chef were very common ones. The raw squid appetizer was disgusting! No kidding, I almost puked after the first taste, very salty and fishy. The entire meal was so disappointing that I seriously do not understand how this restaurant got four and half stars of review! And they do not serve the hot stone beef anymore, which is the only one looks eatable. If you have much money and don't care about the taste of food, you can go to this place. Otherwise, I don't recommend anyone go there.
Brian L.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}509}604}1466}18}4}3/15/2015}I would agree with most on the reviews where you feel like you're in Tokyo. Stepping foot inside a residential or government building, walking inside a beaten path like you would for most restaurants like Jiro or Yoshitake. That is pretty much spot on. The food however is something less to be truly desired. Not that it's not good. It's just not that great. Onsen Uni was good. It was a very balanced dish. Chawanmushi was decent but wasn't the best I had. Sakamai tastes a tad better. The tuna tartar was good but I wish it had some house made soy for more depth in flavor. Otherwise, a bit bland. The chicken Karage was good. Probably the best bang for the buck. 5 huge pieces, freshly fried and hot as it hits the table. These chunks of meat are enormous. Needed a tad bit more salt. The soba Uni was good. Noodles were bouncy, Uni was creamy and overall a decent dish. The chocolate soufflé was very rich and tasty. The sesame Creme brûlée was probably the best thing I had. Not sure if I would visit again, but every culinary fan should at least once.
A A.}Brooklyn, NY}2}30}0}-1}1}3/14/2015}Honestly, I'm baffled where these positive reviews are coming from. Maybe they changed chefs? We got the tuna tar tar, which was so small and tasted weird. The oysters were nauseating I spit them out. The shrimp spring rolls completely tasteless, Last was the beef tataki, which was tiny tiny pieces of "wagyu beef" full of fat we didn't even finish it, the beef also looked so different from the pictures I saw here on yelp. We stopped there, at fear of what the next thing would taste like and ended up going to eat a nice burger after this experience. Also, the food took 30 minutes at a time to come to our table.
Ma L.}New York, NY}13}64}241}-1}5}3/14/2015}Soooo good. One of the best Japanese restaurants in the city, and I have been to many high end ones including Soto, Yasuda, Sugiyama, Hatsuhana, etc.Bf and I came here on a date. Bf lived in Japan for two years. He told me that Sakagura is one of the most authentic Japanese bar/restaurants in the city. The place is modeled after a Japanese bar.The food is one of a kind. We ordered the fluke with radish, which is amazing. Fluke is sweet, radish is salty and flavorful, and if you combine them the effect is simply powerful. The fried pork is JAW DROPPING. I have never had fried pork as good as this one. The meat is not regular pig. It's black pig. It has a smell of the nature. Like the grass. When it's so hot and we squeeze lemon juice all over it......Mmmmmm.Then there's tofu. Really really flavorful too. There's mushroom in it too. The broth is so good. We drank the very last drop.My bf got caviar rice ball, which is kind of spicy and very strong. He loves it, but it's little too heavy for me. I ordered Uni soba, which is the star of the night. The broth is fish stock based tainted with the deliciousness that is sea urchin. The sea urchin that they put on the soba is also top notch, very sweet. The soba is THE best I have ever had. No one of.I will be back in no time. This place is a real gem.
Kwiri Y.}Los Angeles, CA}1471}334}2076}18}5}3/13/2015}Totally worth the trip. High quality sashimi with great service. Santa Barbara Uni tasted fresher than the ones we eat in Los Angeles. Toro was delicious & rest of the sushi was really fresh as well. Great value. Their pork belly dish was to die for. Specials on their menu is highly recommended as its a unique dining experience. Udon is something you should consider trying since it's different than the usual udon. Got lost for almost 45 min due to all the constructions on the street but it's definitely worth the foodie adventure trip to this restaurant.Make sure to get a reservation if you can!
Patrick B.}ASTORIA, NY}11}8}1}-1}4}3/13/2015}Doing this so I remember the name and location. Neat, secretive spot below an office building. Will try to write a longer review later, but definitely worth the visit.
Jenn E.}North Royalton, OH}0}7}0}-1}4}3/12/2015}Ka-pow punch to the taste buds.  What a lunch!  The tasting menu for lunch was totally worth the money.  Friendly staff, amazing food, good drink selection.  I am telling all my friends about this unique and somewhat hard to find place.
Ray S.}Hollywood, FL}0}7}0}-1}5}3/12/2015}What a gem of a place.  Once you navigate your way through the office building and down the stairs you are welcomed to a very authentic Japanese restaurant. The food is off the chart delicious, the ambiance awesome and the whole experience fantastic.  The only negative is that after 2 hours they want to turn the table and the waiter walked over 2x to tell us that we had to go, even though there were other open tables.  Enjoy this Japanese oasis!!
Cevat A.}New Brunswick, NJ}10}4}5}-1}5}3/11/2015}I have been trying to eat here and finally dream came true tonight. We were there at 7.10, 5 minutes before our reservation and we were seated right away. The service was amazing, our waiter was really attentive. The portions are small but this is the concept. We ordered 5 plates including hot stone wagyu beef, salmon over rice(sake oyako don), omelette with eal (Tamago yaki), grilled cod (gindara yuan yaki) and inaniwa udon noodles and also black sesame creme brule at the end. Everything cost 95 dollars excluding tip. It was totally worth it. Especially salmon over rice and hot stone wagyu beef were amazing. And creme brule finish at the end was on point. I strongly recommend Sakagura. In my opinion, it's one of the best affordable Japanese restaurants in the city.
Scott L.}San Francisco, CA}6}53}0}-1}4}3/11/2015}The signage is pretty confusing.  You have to go through an office building lobby, find the correct door, go downstairs into a shady looking basement, and find yet another correct door...and then you enter the restaurant waiting area.  Then, there is much confusion while the coat check/front desk staff appear to be pretty clueless with being able to handle the people waiting for a table to open up along with the people who had made a reservation.  I had made a reservation over a month prior, and yet I was left waiting around with a lot of other confused people for several minutes before needing to put my assertive cap on.  Also, our waitress was friendly, but a bit clueless and inattentive.  There seemed to be a general air of confusion.  They kept delivering us food that we hadn't ordered...and kept walking by us without noticing our trying to get their attention.  Maybe it's only Saturday nights that are like this?  Management needs to address all this.But really, I don't care about any of that so much because the food and sake is WONDERFUL and REASONABLY PRICED.  So many delicious and creative Izakaya style options.  Every single bite was perfection.  We ordered so many different things, and we each got to sample a lot, and we would love to come back and try other things as well.Party of four, tons and tons of food and premium sake, and we left there with a bill totalling only $320...and our bellies were full and our brains tipsy.  This was a lovely contrast to our not so great experience at Yasuda across the street a week earlier...go to Sakagura instead!!  Just be aware of the strange location, poor signage, and inept staff and you'll be fine.
Jenny J.}Manhattan, NY}68}48}31}-1}4}3/11/2015}Delicious japanese food. Everything melts in your mouth. I got the salmon roe rice bowl, tuna tartar, pork belly. The cocktails were ok,  I've had better but not complaining. Serious foodgasm
Emma F.}Troy, NY}0}3}0}-1}3}3/6/2015}5star foods, 1 star waitress. If u expect Japanese service for this Japanese restaurant, ur review will be 1 star. I feel sorry for Japanese manager who has to follow up horrible service from unsmiling waitress.
Esther M.}Manhattan, NY}3}38}0}-1}4}3/1/2015}Authentic izakaya, with great sake selections.  Located in the basement of an office building in midtown, half the fun of going is finding this place.  You know this place is legit because its filled with Japanese Business men!I was disappointed by the Uni Soba, definitely not a the highlight of the meal.  But the Black Sesame Creme Brûlée is amazing, and warrants a visit just to eat!
Nadine K.}San Francisco, CA}1}15}0}-1}1}3/1/2015}My experience here was nothing short of awful. I was so excited to go here because I love soba and a good Japanese restaurant. But I had such a terrible experience. I had to get my order to go because the food took over an hour to arrive, without any explanation offered for why this happened. And the soba was not good. First issue:I wanted to order the daily lunch special, but when I did, the waitress said they were out of it, and that "I need to come earlier." It was 12:30 pm. Second issue:My friend's order and mine came out about an hour after we ordered it. We asked the waitress where it was a few times, and all she said was, "Sorry," and offered no more explanation. We sat there and watched as people who came later than us got their food.A different waiter came to our table and said he was sorry it took so long. When we asked why, he said the kitchen lost the ticket. I told the waitress I wanted it to go, because I needed to be somewhere in 15 minutes."I can't give you soba to go," she said. "What?""It will get soggy.""I came here to eat lunch, " I said, getting confused and frustrated.  "Okay, " she poignantly offered. (Crickets, crickets...)While we continued to wait, I saw three people who had ordered the exact same thing (tempura soba) get their food before me even after we had pointed out their tardiness. The other waiter came by our table again. "I can give you free dessert," he said."We have to go! We don't have time for dessert." We left, and I grabbed my soba from the second, better, waiter, on the way out - and only because I happened to see him; at that point, I didn't even understand or care if I was getting anything to go, based on the first waitress's response that I COULDN'T get food that I had ordered, or any lunch, to go. Third issue:My friend's soba, who actually got to eat it at the restaurant, quickly though she had to eat it since it came at the last minute, was mediocre (wait time now: 1 hr, 15 minutues). Mine was also just blah - not good. I ate it because I just wanted to know, and after 2 hours after ordering food, I was so hungry.  It felt pretty awful to be treated so poorly, and the food certainly wasn't worth it, or even worth going out to eat for, period. Don't go here.
Geoff E.}McKinney, TX}15}26}32}-1}5}2/27/2015}Unreal experience- great food - huge Sake collection. So glad I tried it and ventured down the basement stairs!
Rob G.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}17}132}0}-1}5}2/24/2015}Went here for a friends birthday. The restaurant is hidden away in the basement of an office building. The atmosphere was great and the food and drink were delicious. First lets start with the sake. We tried three different type of sake, all of which were great. Some of the food we ordered the following:Waygu on hot stone - They bring you sliced waygu which ou sear on a hot stone. It was good but pricey. Definitely worth a try.Gyu Miso Nikomi - this was my favorite dish. shredded beef ribs in a miso sauce...it was fantasticYuba Shumai - the pork shumai was good. Not the best thing we had there but still good.Tori Karaage - fried chicken baby! careful when eating because they are hot!We had a couple of other dishes as well, all of which were good. Overall, I was very impressed with the restaurant and hope to go back soon.
Jon F.}San Francisco, CA}471}870}4}-1}5}2/18/2015}Authentic and delicious Japanese food in an underground culinary bunker.
Clark N.}New York, NY}0}1}1}-1}1}2/17/2015}Horrible service. This is not a sushi restaurant. This is a snobbish, Japanese insider joint. If you want sushi and don't want to be hungry a few minutes after you leave, head towards Chinatown.
Albert C.}Manhattan, NY}376}63}349}-1}4}2/11/2015}Sakagura is a hidden gem located in Midtown East that offers a full range of house made sake and delectable Japanese cuisine. To get to the restaurant, one must go into the lobby and take the stairs down a sketchy side door. Although I am not a big fan of sake,  I could tell that these guys were serving more than the average glass of Junmai. Now, I came here for the pork belly, but everything else I ordered exceeded my expectations. The agedashi tofu was tender and flavorful. The uzaku, or grilled eel, was seasoned perfectly with vinaigrette and complemented the cucumber and wakame seaweed well. One of my favorite dishes that I highly recommend is the Uni soba. Sakagura served a generous portion that I shared with my table. To finish the meal, I had two desserts, but I would only really recommend the black sesame creme brulee with ice cream.
Weiwei L.}Syracuse, NY}5}3}21}-1}5}2/9/2015}I would recommend Otoro, eel onigiri, hot stone beef, and sea urchin soba. They have a good selection of sake as well. If you really like sake, there's another good sake bar downtown called Decibel.
Melissa L.}San Francisco, CA}155}564}88}18}4}2/8/2015}A local brought me here and I'm so glad he did.  He mentioned that it was highlighted on a Bourdain show but as we parked and walked up to the entrance I asked if he had the right address.  We were in midtown and standing in front of an office building.  However, a few steps down a flight of stairs and I was transported into another world.Sakagura is a large, fairly modern izakaya.  I loved the decor, especially the bar and the display of sake behind it.  I really felt as if I were transported to Japan as it was similar to some I have visited.  Most of the patrons appeared to be from Japan, visiting NYC.  We tried a variety of items from their menu - tempura, agedashi tofu, chawanmushi, karaage sashimi and chicken meatballs.  All dishes were delicious, flavorful, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented.   Prices are on the high side, but you're paying for the quality and freshness of ingredients, ambiance and location.Sakagura is not a place for a fast meal.  Plan to enjoy a leisurely paced event with your companion(s).  Service was warm and friendly, and they did a good job of helping us navigate through their menu.I am looking forward to returning to try other items on their menu, especially their noodles.
cy c.}ASTORIA, NY}80}133}0}-1}5}2/6/2015}waguy beef and pork belly are impressive.udon noodle soup is one of my favorite, very light, with spinach, a hint of yuzu, everything is well-balanced. this is a great example of how food is so simple can be SO good if everything is done right.  cod, crab steam rice, baked oyster are solidtataki is tender but a bit too astringent to my taste.  I'm not that impressed with their karaage items though. nothing special about the sesame cream brulee, but it's decent. service is just right. very comfortable experiences.I absolutely love this place.
Cate S.}New York, NY}140}80}6}-1}5}2/3/2015}Sakagura certainly does not need my 5-star review.  I have never seen a restaurant with this many reviews with this high a rating, so when it came to celebrate my friend's birthday, I knew this would be the right spot!  It did not disappoint - the experience was simply marvelous! This is the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to, period. Every single dish we got was amazing.  The crab rice that takes a bit longer to come out was a delight: fresh crab pieces mixed into a hotpot of sticky rice. Beef tataki - beef slices cooked at the table on a stone!  Tender & juicy. Tuna tartar and other sashimi subtly flavored and fresh. We also got Agedashe Tofu, and also a very juicy beef in a stew... I think it's called Gyu Miso Nikomi, that just melts in your mouth.  We also had the black sesame creme brulee and choco cake for dessert and if it was socially acceptable we would've licked the plates.  Everything is flavored to perfection here; a culinary marvel hidden in the basement of an office building.  If not for the price, I would be a regular.  Just note that in order to have a satisfying meal, you will dish out $60-70 per person. But it's worth every penny.
Jerry L.}Sydney, Australia}17}130}46}18}4}1/31/2015}I went here with my friend for dinner and we both left somewhat satisfied. We ordered the sashimi platter, Uni Soba, some beef dish they cooked at the table, seaweed salad, pork belly and the tuna tartar. The two dishes that definitely stood out was the seaweed salad (with sesame sauce) and the Uni Soba. The rest were okay. The tuna tartar tasted like what all tuna tartar generally taste like so...nothing special. The Sashimi platter was a bit overpriced for what it was but it definitely was fresh. The beef dish was good but the portion size just wasn't satisfying...It would have been worth it if the beef was amazing but it wasn't. All in all it still was a good experience. I still, however, would rank Nobu and Brushstroke above this restaurant.
Merlin L.}San Diego, CA}31}18}2}-1}5}1/24/2015}The dishes are just wonderful! I've been an expert in Japanese cuisine, and I found the soba here is the best I have had. Uni soba, which is served for a limited amount everyday, was terrific. The cuisine was very authentic, and the price was really really reasonable.
Sharfi F.}Larchmont, NY}56}27}5}-1}5}1/24/2015}Is annoying that you have to go all the way to midtown east for this restaurant? Yes (unless you live near there - in which case, my sympathies for all the tourists you must endure) Is it weird that when you see the sign for the restaurant it sits atop the entrance to an office lobby? Hell yes.Eventually you'll figure out that the restaurant is in the basement (after following a flight of sketchy stairs, possibly taking a wrong turn to an abandoned elevator pit and then retracing your steps back to where you made your grave mistake) You suddenly turn a corner to what feels like emerging into an elegant restaurant in Tokyo. It's insane! The decor is so tasteful and the ambience is calm. We ordered the aged tofu (excellent) the braised beef ribs (simply divine) and hot udon noodles (out of this world!!) My friend was disappointed because they didn't have sushi but in a place like this it is to be expected. Phenomenal selection of sashimi dishes. I highly recommend and if I can get a table will be going back very soon!!!
Ashvini T.}New York, NY}56}44}0}-1}4}1/22/2015Updatedreview}Great place generally but waiter was rude this time around. Highly recommend the black sesame creme brûlée!
Rebecca C.}New York, NY}280}308}7}-1}3}1/22/2015}I walked into a dark restaurant to ask if Sakagura was cleverly hidden in the basement. The person behind the counter was not amused and pointed out that I was inside Totto Ramen. Haha. My bad. Sakagura is actually located in the basement of the building next door, but you will need to walk through a very brightly lit lobby to get there.The restaurant is rustic in a Japanese way and the most beautiful feature (to me, anyway) is the outside and inside of the women's restroom, which looks like a large wooden barrel/silo of some sort. There is surprisingly ample seating but seems to cater to smaller parties, which is fine because it maintains a more intimate dining experience for each group. The service of course, was superb (as most Japanese businesses are) and though we were late for our reservation, they kindly held our table for us. I don't have much to say about the food as I felt lukewarm about everything we ordered. Not that it was prepared poorly, but nothing stood out the way it did to me at Yakitori Totto. One thing to note: the Ika Shiokara (sliced raw squid cured in salt and a squid liver marinade) is extremely pungent so it is not for the faint of heart. Though I had a pleasant dining experience here, I will not likely return to Sakagura.
A B.}Philadelphia, PA}19}147}230}-1}4}1/18/2015}Albeit pricey, this place is a wonderful spot for its traditional dishes and the sophisticated atmosphere. A definite cozy charm for a date!
Tj F.}Lynbrook, NY}310}223}8}-1}4}1/17/2015}My Lady picked this place for my Birthday Dinner simply because she knows how much of a fan i am when it comes to Authentic Japanese Dishes. Sakagura is one of those traditional eateries in the Basement of an Office Building which transforms into a Tokyou eatery in a few minutes after you enter the place with screens everywhere to ensure privacy. The Restaurant is a little bit hard to get reservations due to its popularity and they will call you an hour before your reservations to remind you that if you are over 10 minutes late , then you might as well forget about coming. We were seated about 10 minutes after we arrived by the hostess. The Menu is very friendly and has a lot of Small Plates with some being Cold dishes and some hot. The Sake Wine List was very extensive and prices varied from 9 dollars to over $200 and there were even desert varieties.We started out with the Seaweed Salad which we had with Ponzu sauce. There were 4 different varieties of the Salad which was surprising since i was only used to getting one kind. It was delicious and Chewy and the sauce was very complimentary.We also ordered the Grilled Squid which was finely diced and finely seasoned. Next we had the Beef Tongue in a sauce which was succulent and very rich in taste and i wish it didn't finish so soon.It came accompanied with some Chinese Vegetables. We also ordered some Shumai and some Gindara Yuan Yaki which was some Black Cod Filets in a sweet sauce. This was one of my favorites but i think the Kurobuta Karaage which is the Deep Fried Pork tenderloin marinated in Curry and Oyster Sauce was the best. The Batter was deeply seasoned and the meat was so tasty but luckily there was still room for dessert.We ordered a Carafe of Sake throughout dinner  and had some Plum Wine for Dessert which was a treat in itself.We had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and a pear fruit with Green tea ice cream which was by far one of the finer treats and i am not really into desserts. Overall the Service was great and the Food was definitely worth raving about and i will definitely be back. FYI if you are only used to Sushi type restaurants then this might not by your thing. Japanese have about 7 different cuisines of which Sushi is only one and this is one of them.
Ruoqi Z.}New York, NY}113}93}95}-1}5}1/15/2015}We ordered the uni soba, the tuna tar tar, the crab with rice, the beef tataki and the black sesame creme brûlée. Everything is cooked perfectly. The beef tataki is very tender and i love the texture. The uni soba is great and the broth is perfect. Seriously, order anything from the menu and it will not disappoint. This is one of those place that is worth coming back for. It is on the basement of a building. The authentic decor is a plus.
Zhao H.}New York, NY}4}103}4}-1}3}1/15/2015}Trying to find this place is a journey of itself. Nice presentation, clean atmosphere. Slow service.
Miki N.}Irvine, CA}0}13}3}-1}4}1/14/2015}I'm Japanese-American. I've lived in Tokyo on and off throughout my life. Anyone who's lived in Japan will immediately feel a sense of familiarity, starting with the slightly worn random office building stairway entrance into the basement. Once you enter the restaurant, the decor will be familiar for many a depaato soba restaurant in any city in Japan. The food was awesome. The staff were great. The lunch deals reasonably priced. I will be eating here any time I'm in the area.
Alex L.}Manhattan, NY}9}54}0}-1}4}1/12/2015}Solid place in terms of food. Getting in could be a challenge if not booked in advance. Location is ok but being in a basement doesn't leave a good impression, trying to replicate an authentic Asian ambiance? Who knows. Service is good, but can be sloppy at times. Overall, should you look for a solid Japanese izakaya style place, you can't go wrong with it. Beware, can get quite pricey.
Timmy L.}New York, NY}624}78}4}-1}3}1/11/2015}High quality food that completely missed my palate.Let me make this clear: If you appreciate traditional Japanese food, you will probably love this place. However, for me, this place just did not live up to my expectations. I loved the decor and the immersive Japanese feel and was impressed by their level of service, which was evidenced by the warm towelettes they bring out, unfold, and place in your hands. However, I just was not completely engaged by their food.The problem I had with most of the dishes is that they just did not seem FLAVORFUL enough. Every dish had very high quality ingredients, were impeccably prepared and plated, and were different enough that I got excited reading them on the menu. However, every dish I tried just tasted like the flat total of its ingredients instead of a unified meal with layers of flavor. Honestly, I think this may just be my preferences and not anything against the quality of the food.If you are a fan of traditional Japanese, definitely give this place a try. It has beautiful decor, authentic, pure, and interesting food, and an amazing sake collection. If you aren't sure whether or not you'd like it, you probably won't. The significant amount of money that you will spend here is much better used elsewhere.
Jenny C.}New York, NY}0}24}0}-1}4}1/9/2015}Was told that it is difficult to get a table by walk in. We have reserved table one wk in advance.Bf and I went on xmas eve which they have special menu. The place was crowded and loud, but the food is exceptional! The sashimi was very fresh and the appetizer was mouth watering. The japanese waiter knows well about the menu and helped recommend the sake. Overall, impression dinner given how high standard I have on jap food.
Lucy W. H.}Glendale, CA}614}814}1961}18}4}1/9/2015}You know a place is very popular when they call you an hour before your reservation to tell you they will hold your spot for exactly ten minutes.  It's in the basement, no wi-fi.  They wanted to seat me in Restaurant Siberia, under the fuse box -- such a lovely place -- so I opted for the bar instead.  Come here for the sake.  Impressive collection, it's fun to look at the bottles displayed all over the restaurant.  The gold sake currently on promotion to celebrate the New Year is wonderful.  Unfortunately the duck soup broth was thin and bland.  You get four slices of duck which tasted good, 2 shitake mushrooms, but that's it.  Not exactly filling.  Service is good though.  The desserts that passed by me looked delectable, but I restrained myself.
Michael C.}Old Greenwich, CT}35}14}0}-1}1}1/8/2015}I did have 2 good experiences dining a Sakagura in December but this time; it just was not right.  Ok so I got that table in the back room in the corner...again.My forth guest arrived late and they had removed his place setting;  and after asking several times we finally got some chopsticks and eventually  even a napkin near the.l end of the meal.   I guess the table of businessmen with 2 bottles of sake captivated their attention.What really got me was that they removed 2 sake glasses when we had not finished;  I told the waiter and that was it; no sake offered?   So what if my half bottle was $85.   After that he avoided me and I had to request the check from another server.  The food?  Well the sashimi appetitive was nice but the portions of fish are so small.   So I am spoiled by Bar Hayama in Los Angeles where the owner greets me most every time.   The edamame were wrinkled and not appetizing.  The beef cooked on a hot rock was the highlight of the meal;  for that I think I will head to Korea Town next time. Was hot tea offered at the end of the meal?  No!!It all just kind of fizzled out in the end with a whimper and no one dared say that you.   They must have been doing us a favor.My wife said she will never go there again...will I?   Not too soon.
Jennifer C.}New York, NY}40}6}0}-1}3}1/5/2015}This is a decent place. I've never been disappointed, but never been wowed either. Been to both lunch and dinner here. I really do like the Uni soba, but the amount of Uni they provide is definitely skimping- 3 pieces of Maine Uni for a while plate of soba?I would go back because of the convenience (I live across the street from its back door), but it definitely does not live up to its 4.5 star rating.
Stephanie M.}Cambridge, MA}0}16}1}-1}5}1/5/2015}UNBELIEVABLE dining experience. I don't even know where to start. Everything from ambiance to menu to service was spot on and more. The food was out of this world. Eggplant three ways was delicious, tuna tartare was hands down the best I have ever tried.Everything ordered was superb. I can not wait to come back to this hidden gem!
Paris F.}New York, NY}11}306}186}-1}5}1/4/2015}Sakagura offers a traditional japanese food along with the sashimi and other known japanese food.  I truly enjoy all the different variétés of sakes they offer.  I used to go to sakagura during the lunch time for their lunch specials.  It may be hard to find in the beginning If you had never been there but it's worth the trip to the basement of the office building.
Michelle L.}London, United Kingdom}6}11}12}-1}5}1/4/2015}Delicious sashimi - best & freshest sea urchin I've ever had. Each dish was delicious. Great service & decor. I was surprised by the reasonable price given the quality.
Afsoun H.}Beverly Hills, CA}7}16}3}-1}5}12/31/2014}The best dining experience! The service was phenomenal! Our server Takon was nice, but also fast and very knowledgable. The food was unique and delicious. I love a good hole in the wall or in this case basement of a building feel, that also has great food! The grilled cod melts in your mouth and the sesame creme brûlée was like nothing Ive ever had before!
Bing R.}New York, NY}133}457}2665}18}3}12/29/2014Updatedreview}I give them 4 stars because of creativity and not the usual predictable Japanese menu known by everyone.  This is more authentic Japanese cooking you will see in Japan.But this time, after coming back from 2 weeks in Japan, I notice that this restaurant tend to put much more "sugar"!into their preparation.  The special Sakura pork belly which I could buy in the food court of a nice department store in Ginza was less sweet.Another experience we had tonight was our waitress whose face was so serious and seemed to be irritated with anything we ask. Yes, you may be busy; but we are paying customers.The sesame seed creme brûlée was excellent and not too sweet for a desert. It came with a sesame seed ice cream and sesame seed infused crisp thin cookie.It was also disturbing that the exhaust seem not to function efficiently as well as before.  Some of the smoke or fumes from the fried or grilled stuff smelled into our jackets.  Fortunately, Minerva went away but not not my friend's.Right now, I give 3-1/2 stars because it's too sweet (maybe lessen the sweetness a bit), and a grumpy waitress plus the fried or cooking smell are to blame for my lower rating.The food is good! My friend focused on the grumpiness of our waitress which affected our dining tonight.
Grace T.}San Francisco, CA}109}45}20}-1}5}12/29/2014}What an amazing experience! The food was delicious and unique. I recommend onsen tamago, tatami iwashi, and the fluke carpaccio. The onsen tamago was delicious and unexpected for a cold soup, and the tatami iwashi was very creative. The gyu miso nikomi was also good if you want a hearty beef option. For dessert, we had the pear millefeuille with earl grey tea ice cream. The ice cream was fantastic. Definitely recommend. :)The service was excellent. Our waitress had great recommendations (try the yuzu citrus sake!) and our hostess was kind enough to bump up our reservation half an hour when we arrived an hour early.It was a great experience, and I'll definitely be back again. :)
Jefferson S.}Jersey City, NJ}0}16}0}-1}5}12/29/2014}Amazing atmosphere, it looks like you walked into Tokyo through a portal.  You typically buy a bunch of dishes and share them.  Loved it.
Chris L.}New Hyde Park, NY}3}11}1}-1}5}12/27/2014}Great hidden location and even better food. However. Fairly hard to walk-in, neat impossible, so if you want to come I'd recommend you make a reservation. Service is great at the bar and the food is awesome.
Curtis T.}Brooklyn, NY}0}10}0}-1}3}12/25/2014}I went here for lunch. I got the Jewel Oke Bento. The presentation was pretty and the fried pancake smelled great. The overall experience of the meal itself was a little underwhelming though. No singular item was extraordinary, and the items never really came together as a meal either. The salmon sashimi and that fried pancake was tasty. I had the yuzu highball to drink. It wasn't what I expected in a highball. It came in a tiny little glass. It was ok. For dessert, pass on the chocolate soufflé. It was bad. I wouldn't listen to that tip that said this was the best soufflé ever, because it was not. Not even close!I'll come back again for dinner, but lunch was nothing special as some reviews here have mentioned.
Beatrice T.}Los Angeles, CA}303}361}105}-1}3}12/25/2014}Our family of 4 came for Christmas Eve, enjoyed the food but the service was seriously lacking. Waitress did what she needed but was not welcoming. Besides the great table bussers, the overall staff was not warm at all. A bit disappointing for a $350 meal where you're clearly buying an experience. Sashimi, uni soba and wayu beef were wonderful.  Fried tofu, pork belly, and shrimp rolls also greatCrab rice and miso soup were awful. Could have passed on the fried octopus too.
John M.}New York, NY}0}37}0}-1}5}12/20/2014}Hidden in the basement of a non-descript Manhattan office building, one rather improbably enters Tokyo.  The first time I came here and walked down a few flights of stairs, it evoked a feeling of entering a "speakeasy" that was right under our nose. You mean there's a real Japanese village right under 43rd street?  Now that we have been back for lunch many times, I feel it's time to do a review.This place is amazing.   The food is delicious, the service is punctual and precise, and the overall atmosphere is authentic Japan.  The real deal.   Why am I not jet-lagged?Though there's a daily special that's pretty reasonable, these dishes go fast if you are dining after 1 PM.  In any event there's a wide selection of other entrees; I prefer the handmade soba noodles.  I have had Kamo Nanban which is a bowl of hot noodles with duck slices, shitake mushrooms, and scallions.  Handmade soba is like truly handmade pasta.  There is a difference!My wife has often tried the variations of Donburi Bowls, again with soba noodles.She also has had Sashimi  Soba  Gozen.Though we always drink green tea, there's an amazing Sake list for the afficionados as well as some great Japanese beers, some of them craft brews which are pretty rare, albeit pricy. While we often don't have desert in Japanese restaurants, on each visit here we have broken with tradition and ordered the Chocolate Soufflé which comes with vanilla ice cream and raspberry coulis.  This is a real find too and delicious, authentic and served at perfect temperature.  On all of our visits the service has been attentive, professional and not obtrusive.   We love Sakagura and simply say it's Ichiban.
Kelly K.}Manhattan, NY}3}34}117}-1}4}12/20/2014}Good service, lovely decor and space, and had one of the best Uni Soba, with some hot sake.
Cyndy L.}Oakland, CA}1}194}2}-1}4}12/16/2014Updatedreview}Four years later, I had a much better experience.  The uni soba and black sesame creme brulee were excellent.  Cold duck appetizer and spinach in peanut sauce were fine but not great.  Good sake.  Friendly, helpful service.
Rebecca Y.}Kew Gardens, NY}173}81}81}-1}3}12/15/2014}Service was disappointing. Food was not as good as we remembered but still ok. But service  was just bad - we were given a table that was too small for our party. We didn't get enough plates or water and had to follow up on the sake we ordered.
Albert Y.}Manhattan, NY}205}26}3}-1}4}12/11/2014}There really isn't much more to add to the long list of reviews that have been posted here already. However, I can solidly say that yes, I am a big fan.This unexpected hidden gem in the basement of a Midtown office building is one of the best spots for Japanese cuisine in the city. With its soft lighting and Japanese themed decor, you feel like you could be in the middle of bustling Tokyo, the place really does transport you to another world. The menu is varied and everything is excellently prepared. Having been here multiple times, I would recommend coming here with a group, ordering many small dishes and sharing. Additionally, avail yourself of the sake menu. Sakagura also has extremely crisp Asahi on tap if you are in a mood for beer.Reservations are highly recommended.If you are lucky enough to be able to sneak away during lunch time, Sakagura has an excellent and reasonably priced lunch menu. The Rice and Noodle combo sets on offer are hearty and filling. Also featured is the daily lunch special. My favorite is Friday's Hayashi Rice --Hashed Beef in a thick Demi-Glace Sauce Over Rice. A delicious, savory meal which really hits the spot after Thursday night revelries.My Ratings System (2014):5. Exceptional, one of a kind. 4. Excellent. Highly Recommended. 3. Average with some redeeming qualities. 2. Below Average.  1. Avoid, Major Flaws.
Lily L.}Manhattan, NY}0}44}4}-1}4}12/7/2014}It's always so hard to find a special place for celebratory lunch in midtown.  This is the spot to bring someone you like at work.You walk into a corporate building and go down the basement to this underground restaurant - feels like a Japanese IzakayaService is great as expected.  Good bento box sets to choose from with a huge selection of sakes.
Herman K.}Las Vegas, NV}6}11}26}-1}3}12/4/2014}Came here and was all booked.. The bar is first come first serve but was also a wait so we decided to make rsvp for another day... The day finally came... With all the heavy rsvp and good reviews on this place I was super excited to try it out... Service was nice, decor was nice as well... Not noisy at all.. But the food wasn't what we expected... Ordered a bottle of sake and ordered a few dish.. The only thing worth mention was the uni pasta.. Only because the uni is sweet.. The pasta itself was serve cold and not very tasty... Other dish like the chawamushi and the fried rice wasn't that good.. Will not return!!
Oriane G.}Paris, France}10}159}175}-1}5}11/27/2014}OMG! definitely one of my favourite japanese restaurant. it is quite hard to find ( basement of a building) we ordered a dozen of dishes to share: sashimi, marinateded beef fillet, cod fished, yuzu chicken, slices of beef grilled on a hot stone, marinated squid, tofu, udon noodles... and for desert a not-so-japanese chocolate soufflé. for drinks we had a very good sake and tried a japanese beer (Sapporo) as well. The food is divine, service perfect and the atmosphere is unique. you could actually be in Tokyo instead of NYC.
Ann S.}Guaynabo, Puerto Rico}0}18}0}-1}5}11/27/2014}All I can say is AWESOME! This the third year I visit NYC and this restaurant and each meal seems better every time. The sake menu was overwhelming but I simply asked the wait staff to help me pick and was thrilled with her suggestion. We had the pork  belly, the tuna tartar, the beef cooked on hot stone, the sashimi appetizer and finished off with the sesame crime brûlée. It was all amazing.
Deanna S.}FOREST HILLS, NY}151}138}1143}18}5}11/26/2014}Hello Japanese wonderland of extravagant dishes that words can't even accurately describe! I love this place. I love it to pieces. If I could maybe get a card that makes me a life time customer at this establishment, forever eating and drinking here - I mean, YEA I think I would take it! lol This is the most fantastic of Japanese restaurants that I have ever had the privilege of dining in. The service is beyond superb, the variety of sake is incomparable, and the FOOD, oh goodness wait until we get to the foooooood! Never has food ever been cooked so beautifully that it melts in your mouth, massages your taste buds and just fills your body and soul with explosions of delicious flavor. (I could be exaggerating from my love of this place, but hey - try it and you let me know ;D) It's recommended that for 2 people, 5-7 dishes is a good amount (and pricing wise it won't cut your wallet too deep, I mean really, can this place get any better?!). I would recommend: Buta Kakuni (Stewed Dice Pork) because it's a special. It's great to try if it's your first time because the flavoring on it is just very delightful and sauce light almost like a broth.  Gyu Miso Nikomi: The Beef Back Ribs - uhm let me ponder on the right wording for this - YES, YES, YES, YES, YES. This is probably my favorite small plate in all of Sakagura time! melt in your mouth, flavorful beef  - just foodgasmic. Chawanmushi: This is not for everyone - steamed egg custard with chicken shrimp and ginko nuts! This has thickened ponzu sauce - the flavor on this is a bit intense what with the concentrated sauce, so if you don't like ponzu then perhaps this isn't for you! Ginda Yuan Yaki - Cod fish with sweet soy sauce - again DOUBLE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE YES - imagine tender pieces of fish just waiting to fall off gently into your chopsticks - I can't even with this place. Lastly, I would recommend some soup noodles like the udon to add moisture to the meal - udon is not the thick noodles you expect to just be aware - I mean I love it anyway so no complaints but you should just know it's like thin white noodles! Azumarikishi - superb sake, inexpensive, a good thing to add to the meal - aromatic, not dry - it was an off the top of his head recommendation from our waiter who was also above and beyond wonderful. I can't wait to come back to try more dishes. That's the feeling I want from restaurants and that's why Sakagura gets 5 stars! ~chow! (definitely!)
Paolo C.}New York, NY}44}66}2}-1}5}11/25/2014}I love everything about sakagura, it's by far the bast Japanese restaurant for lunch in NYC and the price point is excellent.
Nawvid A.}Irving, TX}0}12}0}-1}4}11/21/2014}We went with a group of friends when we were visiting NYC and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals! It's almost tapas style Japanese food and we ordered a wide array of hot and cold items. The most popular item in our group was the beef short ribs (must try!). Each one of the dishes had a very unique flavor and in a group of somewhat picky eaters, we all enjoyed every dish! Quite a lot to choose from on the menu and the service was quick and efficient. I only wish they gave a larger portion!
Linda X.}San Francisco, CA}688}195}35}-1}4}11/20/2014}For the 2 hours that I was there, I felt like I was back in Japan. This dimly lit, well decorated underground restaurant is the perfect izakaya.The menu is extensive. My absolute favorite was the beautifully plated tuna tartare, followed closely by the fried marinated chicken. The sake menu can be a bit overwhelming, so make sure to ask the waitress for a walk-through. Her suggestion for us was perfect!My only complaint is the wait time between courses.I'll be back for that sesame creme brulee!
Food L.}West New York, NJ}9}135}0}-1}5}11/17/2014}Everything was great. Service was professional and knowledgable. Very Japanese. We had agadashi tofu - silky smooth. Karage was plentiful and juicy!Chicken meatballs were great. Pork belly stew. So good I mixed it with white rice. Plum sake, dry sake, awamori - we loved the advice from our server and the choices.Desserts were also awesome for a bar/izakaya. Earl grey ice cream and the pear tart is amazing!!!! I love Japanese milk tea so I'm a bit biased. This place is the best sake bar/ izakaya I've ever been to. You need to be here.
Michael B.}New York, NY}275}11}0}-1}2}11/16/2014}I was dying to like this place based on the reviews and my general love of Japanese food, but my meal fell flat. We went for dinner, and ordered a wide variety of the dishes since Sakagura seems to feature mostly small plates.  They were out of the hamachi collar and a few other specials that looked great, so we went with mostly regular menu staples.Since we ordered so many dishes I can't remember each in particular, but a few stood out:Uzaku: the eel was lifeless and soggy, but the vinaigrette and seaweed went nicely together.Maguro Natto: This was the star of the meal for me, the natto and rice were just like you'd find in Tokyo.  However, you can get natto over rice with an egg in Tokyo for around $3 - and the tuna really didn't do the dish any favors.Clay pot rice with crab and crab butter: The menu said it would take around 45mins to prepare, which we were fine with.  From the description the dish sounded wonderful, but dear God it was like eating hot mushy nothingness.  The rice was overcooked and the crab was barely present.  The dish was severely underseasoned and there was nothing to offset the mushy texture.  If the rice has not been overcooked it may have been better, but overcooked rice + specs of crab meat + butter amounts to a bowl of rice with the consistency of tapioca pudding.Black sesame creme brulee: This dish was very good.  The sugar was well-toasted and the black sesame made for a not-too-sweet, almost savory flavor that I love about many Japanese desserts.Service: Efficient, if not a little brusk.Decor: It's a very comfortable and warm atmosphere - which is pretty impressive considering it's in the basement of a midtown office building.  The bathrooms are in barrel-like structures and have Toto toilets with washlets. Overall, the trip just made me pine for the amazing food I've had in Japan.  For the hefty cost of the meal (granted we also ordered sake), I just felt shortchanged by Sakagura.  Mediocre food at high prices.  There are just too many better options in Manhattan to justify going back.
Annie C.}Brooklyn, NY}106}145}43}-1}4}11/13/2014}The place is hidden but worth finding. Sashimi is fresh. Black sesame créme brulee is the best!!!!!! The desserts here are the highlights. Save room for desserts!!!
Kayo N.}Brooklyn, NY}141}320}101}18}5}11/12/2014}In one word: impeccable.  I've been dying to give out a 5 star review (it's been a while) so here goes...I've been frequenting this place for about 10 years now, and I can say that they have consistently delivered very good, thoughtful, and beautifully presented izakaya dishes over the years. And the bill will still be quite reasonable. Other restaurants ought to sit up and take notice.  Best dishes: Duck with basil pesto, any of the karaage style dishes, Sanma omusubi, Tsukune, any of the sashimi or carpaccio style plates, coffee jelly, buta kakuni.Order one of the many hundreds of lovely cold sakes, or have a buckwheat (soba) beer.
Leonard L.}TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY}746}1405}3931}18}5}11/12/2014}Sakagura NY Manhattan Grand Central9pm Saturday 8th November 2014Five Stars In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered:Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme brûlée with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.
Xinyi C.}Charlotte, NC}4}68}117}-1}5}11/7/2014}Awesome vibes, great service and absoluuuutely delicious food! Around 40 min waiting.
Z A.}Brooklyn, NY}2}109}0}-1}5}11/7/2014}Good, friendly service, and the salmon sashimi bowl with marinated salmon roe (can't remember exact name) is basic and delicious. I'm not usually a roe person, but these are like little pops of flavor that explode on your tongue and really bring the dish together.
Samantha K.}Houston, TX}10}33}6}-1}4}11/5/2014}Go on Friday and get the lunch special!! It's always the same shredded beef special and it runs out every Friday, so get there early.
Juliet H.}South Orange, NJ}65}81}25}-1}4}11/3/2014}Very good food.  Ordered the tuna tartare which was good.  The egglplant had nice flavor.  The beef ribs were delicious! Best part of the meal.  We also got hot udon noodles which were good, just a little salty.  Had to flag down staff to get our order in but overall good food.  Would definitely come back to try some of the other dishes.
Patricia G.}Orlando, FL}320}409}817}-1}5}11/1/2014}Talk about a neat find! I walked 2 times across the block looking for this place before I went on their website and realized it was in the basement of a building. When we finally found the sign we went into the building and felt like we were about to go knock-off purse shopping in China town because of the hidden stairwell and secretive entrance. Needless to say, I was already anticipating my meal. The staff here was SO NICE. We went in pretty late in the evening and although they are open late (closes at 12:30am and last order in at 12:45am), we went at about 11:30-11:45pm, we weren't greeted with frowning faces upset that we were coming in late. Well we weren't the only party coming in late in the evening either... Anyways, we were sat down and then lost in translation. The menu was a little overwhelming because it had all the Japanese spelling and then the English and everything was a bit foreign. When the waiter came over he explained the dishes were small and meant to share. It was like a Japanese tapas restaurants. I couldn't wait to try it all at this point. We picked 5 things on the menu which got us pretty full at the end. The server was really helpful because when we went to order the tuna sashimi with a paste I'd never had he asked us if we'd tried anything like that before. Well no not really we said. He then recommended us to have the tuna on its own because we probably wouldn't like it. You know what, I loved his honesty. He was paying attention to what we were ordering and making sure we were going to enjoy every dish! We also ordered the rice balls with salmon, a noodle bowl, chicken meatballs, and duck. The presentation was so detailed for every single dish. They also had such unique flavors. It was truly an experience.We thought we were completely full when our server brought us the dessert menu. It was already past midnight and he could've been discouraging us from ordering dessert so he could kick us out. Instead, he told us the most popular picks creme brulee with black sesame ice cream or the chocolate souffle. You wouldn't think a chocolate souffle would be the best at a Japanese restaurant but it knocked my socks off. It was SO GOOD! The whole dinner was truly an experience. They definitely deserve the 5 stars.Tip: Make sure you get the wifi password because the cell phone signal is really weak in the restaurant.
Julia E.}New York, NY}10}18}23}-1}5}10/31/2014}I m looking forward to my next visit! Everything was delicious! Agedashi tofu, wagyu beef, shrimp balls etc...
Bhumika K.}New York, NY}106}365}14}-1}4}10/30/2014}My boss was visiting from DC and asked me to pick a place for lunch, all he mentioned was that he LOVES seafood. So I picked Sakagura on a whim after doing some research. This place is completely unassuming, you enter through the lobby of an office building - which in midtown they all basically look the same - once downstairs your are transported to what I can only imagine is Japan. It's spacious, but the decor is totally inviting and boy does it get packed during the lunch hours. We ordered our own separate bento's, which for a vegetarian you basically have one choice. But my boss was in a complete food come once we got back to the office. Still a good place and the charm makes up for the lack in menu options for me.
Dave B.}Downtown Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN}0}8}19}-1}5}10/26/2014}A friend and I went at 8:pm on a Sunday and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. After finding the place at 211 East 43rd between 2nd and 3rd Ave., look for the glass revolving door with a long white marble hallway behind it.  Go past the elevators and the door downstairs is the second door on the left after a left turn. We started out with the Amber Jack collar which is a slice of the fish just after the gills (no head). It was grilled to perfection  and it had two distinctive flesh types. Next was the Wagu beef and dicon app and this was our least favorite menu item.  I give it an A for texture and mouth feel but a C on flavor.  I think If they might have grilled it for a minute it would have made the flavor burst and the fat would have had time to semi- melt. It was served cold with a lot of wet shaved radish and scallion.  Next was the amazing bowl of four different seaweeds with the most amazing toasted sesame sauce.Next was the tuna sashimi which was fresh and delicious. Then we had the grilled squid with a glaze of soy which was not chewy at all.The next dish was the best of them all in my oppinion, pork belly served in a bath of rich broth with a small amount of strong ground mustard. We were instructed to pull apart the luxurious layers with both of our chop sticks and let it drift in its sumptuous surroundings.  Adding a tad of spicy mustard to each bite cut the fat and  let the  flavor shine.  Last but not least was the black sesame seed creme brulee'. It was served with a rich scoop of iced cream and a carmelized flat sesame cookie on top.
Nick E.}San Francisco, CA}3}23}0}-1}5}10/26/2014}The best Japanese food I've had, hands down - an eclectic menu full of dishes I've never seen available elsewhere. Everything we ordered was incredibly well executed. Service was helpful yet unobtrusive. Highly recommended.
Xiaoning F.}New York, NY}27}40}110}-1}2}10/25/2014}Because of so many good review on yelp, we have a pretty high expectations on this one. However, we were actually very disappointed. We spent about 80 per person, ordered 8 dishes and 3 desserts. They are all just too salty and sweet. The only good point is the sake. Not recommend to people who have tried real good Japanese food.
Richard Y.}San Francisco, CA}179}86}19}-1}4}10/21/2014}Sakagura is tucked inside the basement of a small office building on 43rd. Initially hard to find at first, a visitor would walk down a flight of stairs to the basement, past the service elevators into a completely different world decorated with traditionally-Japanese furniture and accents.The food is served in small portions - each dish ranges between $8-$16 generally, and is great for sharing and sampling many different things. I came here with a friend visiting out of town and we had:- Roasted eggplants with three different sauces: one of the sauces was a hoisin-like sauce, while the other two were sesame and some other kind of sweet miso glaze. Two slice of eggplant in each sauce, perfect for sharing- Filet of cod: typical Japanese style, the cod came out very well and lightly glazed with a sweet sauce- Diced steak: this came in a curry of sorts which was very nice. The beef was cooked medium-rare- Cold roasted duck: served as an appetizer for us, the duck was cut into thin slices and wrapped some radish. Pretty good, although the duck was overcooked- Fried squid: A little underflavoured in my opinion but tasted very fresh, also a very generous portion- Fried pork: Very generous portion - reminded me of the fried appetizers I would get a bubble tea shop, although much more subtle in its flavours. Came with a lemon slice for you to squeeze on it which adds another dimension of flavour- Sake sorbet: this desert in particular was interesting, as the sorbet came with a side of spicy sake jelly that added a very nice kick to the sweet sorbet. The sorbet itself was almost like shaved ice, intentionally or not.The dishes above were enough to feed two grown men sufficiently for dinner, who I may add were quite hungry. Despite the excellent sake list we didn't have anything to drink, although I will definitely be returning to sample their sake menu.Overall it was a great experience, especially with the ambiance of the place. The bathrooms are in two giant barrels (floor-to-ceiling size). The price tag came out to around $50 (incl tax and service) which is pretty reasonable for a place like this, I feel. Expect a little wait time as it is very popular, especially if you have a large party. Nothing outrageous though -- we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table.Also -- no cell reception as it is in the basement. This can be a blessing and a curse but it does force you to put down your phone during the meal.
Elaine W.}Flushing, NY}85}195}310}-1}4}10/20/2014}First, Sakagura is in the basement of the building so there is no cellphone service down there. It could be a good thing because that would sort of force to talk to whoever you are with. (but they have free wifi for 30 minutes). So, if there is someone trying to reach you or if you're trying to call someone, you would have to go the lobby upstairs to do it. Another note is that there is an elevator if you don't want to take the stairs. My friend made reservations for 9PM because she knew there was going to be a wait. We got there exactly at 9, and there was a wait. (even with reservation). There was a few walk-in as well while we were waiting. So, my advice, make a reservation! The hostesses were so nice and caring. We had a luggage and some other things, so they have a little coat check for our stuff and coats, which was very nice of them. (I tipped them when I left)So after 10 minutes, we got seated. Sakagura is known for sake, so it would be wrong to not order some sort of sake. My friend ordered a sweet sake called Umekanon Plum Sake. Not sure if that is the full name. Anyway, our waitress brought out hot towel for us before starting the meal. And served us tea and the sake. The decor for this place is very authentic and traditional of everything sake related. At the bar, they had different size cups and bottle. Sake is just as complicated as tea, if not more.So we ordered, Onsen Tamgo which had sea urchin that i never head before! Also ordered the Jaga Dango, which was a doughnut filled with mashed potatoes. As for an entree, we both got the Washu Gyu Ishiyaki which was the Washu beef cooked on top hot stone. And for dessert, we ordered the pumpkin brulee and the chocolate souffle.  Everything was delicious and definitely had a star for each plate. The top two things I liked the most was the Washu and the chocolate souffle. Even though you would have to "cook" your meat, it was kinda fun. They use the fat as oil which gave it an extra flavor to it. They will also give you a new stone if it turns cold. The chocolate souffle tasted like a semi-cooked brownie. But thing that stood out the most for me was the strawberry/berry sauce that you could drizzle on top. That gave it an extra refreshing taste. It balanced out the heavy chocolate. There was also ice cream if the souffle was getting too hot, also changes up your palette from all the chocolate. Our waitress was very nice and answered any questions we had about the menu and recommendations. She also apologized when they ran out of some of the sake my friend ordered for the dessert. Just a quick aside, the bathroom is hidden within the decor that I never noticed. It's in the round cylindrical things, which I thought was interesting. I think it's in the shape of what the thing they ferment the sake? I don't know. But I thought it was nice that it just camouflages into the decor. It was such a pleasant experience. I would like to come back for lunch and see how that's like, cause they have some lunch specials. They need better cellphone service!
Vivek M.}Bellevue, WA}30}26}0}-1}5}10/18/2014}I am giving a 5 star despite having the worst hostess on earth and most inattentive staff for a $$$ place. She was also super reluctant to replace the beef in the tasting platter for us with something else. The food just was so great that nothing else mattered. We got the tuna and avocado salad and the tasting platter. All of the fish was great and really fresh. I would come back just for the sesame creme brûlée.  It is like nothing I have had before.
Tony C.}Great Neck, NY}218}192}382}18}5}10/16/2014}Small plate dishes excellent sake selection, everything we came here it was busy, reservation recommended!
Phuong V.}Riverside, CA}1}10}0}-1}3}10/16/2014}Came here on what I thought would be a busy friday night since I booked reservations on open table and the only slot they had available was at 10pm. My boyfriend and I came about 9:00pm since we ended up finishing our activities early and thought maybe we can squeeze in at an earlier time. First the place can be difficult to find. The sign is very tiny at the front of the building and is actually located down in the basement.When we asked the hostess if she can fit us in at an earlier time she said we would have to sit and wait to see what she can do. At this time I watched THREE parties get seated before us who came after us with no reservations!!! She told them the wait time was 15 mins yet I had to wait longer because I made a reservation?!? I wasn't sure of the policy and thought maybe the seating was different from people with reservations and not so I didn't complain. We got seated 40 mins later and to my astonishment as we walk in... EMPTY tables everywhere!! I really don't understand what their deal was with making us wait that long and here we are seated near the parties who came after us so there wasn't special seatings.The food: Be warned, they charge for refills on iced tea... Should have expected that since I noticed they weren't quick to refill our drinks. The food is served like tapas style so small dishes.Fluke Carpaccio: fresh and tasty, a nice start to our meal.Agedashi Tofu: my favorite part of the meal, light and crispy with bonito flakes in top. (I enjoy eating tofu)Ebi Stick: not bad but I wasn't expecting it be rolled in an egg roll wrapper.Wagyu beef: The presentation was lovely with a hot stone to cook the meat on, but the meat didn't taste anything special..Uni Soba: it was ok. I realized after trying this I'm not big on cold noodles but thought I would give it a try. Overall the food was ok. There was a lot of other things I wanted to try that sounded good but we got full. I want to come back just to sample the other dishes but with the reservation situation probably not.Our waiter was amazing and did a very good job at explaining about the different sakes and plum wines. He was very attentive and friendly.
Claire H.}New York, NY}284}149}204}18}2}10/13/2014}Came here last night and I'm disappointed at best. Wanted to go somewhere really special with my parents. Ended up thinking the restaurant was just .... EhWe ordered a lot of things, a few good ones- tamagoyaki (which was probably one of the best I've had), eggplant (above average, nothing special), pork belly (flavor ok, definitely could have been waaaay more tender), fried marinated chicken, uni soba (now this I enjoyed, but they only give you three teeny pieces of fresh uni), grilled onigiri, and the kabocha squash creme brûlée. All these items were just good, the only thing stellar was the tamago and maybe the fried chicken, which was also on the salty side. But come on, it's fried chicken.....The things that were average or below average- fried shrimp balls (there was NO fresh shrimp flavor, skip these), edamame (would have been good but came out frozen!!!!!!!!!!!!!), tuna natto (natto aficionados I was with said it wasn't stinky/authentic enough and there was also a tendon in my tuna), the beef tongue stew with daikon and taro (nothing special and way too salty and heavy), chilled tofu appetizer (nothing special... At all, skip). Skip the regular onigiri and get the grilled. All in all, it may have been my expectations that ruined the meal. But I'm willing to bet that it was the lackluster food and mediocre service (nice waiter, but messed up two of our orders- the onigiri (he brought out the wrong flavors) and the edamame-which was frozen). At one point I even thought that perhaps it's because we didn't order the "right" things- but if you're a 4.5 star yelp restaurant and pretty damn expensive ($250 for four people), every damn item on the menu better be yummy. Izakaya is better and cheaper elsewhere- Mew izakaya and fukurou.
Lily S.}New York, NY}15}14}0}-1}3}10/12/2014}We've been here before and had a good experience the first time, 4 stars. We went again yesterday and have downgraded to 3 stars. We ordered 2 orders of wagyu with hot stone but the meat came out looking different on each plate. 1 was clearly fresher than the other.  When we asked about the tofu dish we had at our earlier visit (showed the waiter the picture of it), the waiter said they don't offer it there and must be a different restaurant or their lunch menu. He said chawanmushi is a much better dish and substitute...fortunately it's not tofu at all. We weren't really impressed with this restaurant after this visit. Too bad. Is it a different quality of food and service now?
Justin I.}Manhattan, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}10/11/2014}Make no mistake: if you are coming here, you are coming for the sake. The food is good and a great compliment to the drinks, but there is nothing spectacular about it. The sake selection, however, is fantastic. It features probably around 200 choices but is not overwhelming. There are helpful descriptions and our waiter provided very good recommendations. We tried a bottle of a cold sake and a carafe of a hot one; we were blown away with both, especially since none of us were heavy sake-drinkers. If you don't like sake, come to Sakagura before you swear it off forever, just don't come with an appetite!
Rob B.}New York, NY}5}174}21}-1}4}10/11/2014}We really like Sakagura.  Our first trips here, years a go, we were enamored with the location - buried in the basement of a midtown office building.  It felt secret, except it's not a well kept one.  The food has always been good.  It's important to realize that there is much more to Japanese cuisine than sushi.  This is NOT a place for sushi.  Yes, you can get a couple of raw dishes here, but that's not why you come.  Come for the small cooked dishes that are so hard to find in the US.  Bring friends and order lots of little plates to share.  We do wonder if the quality has declined some over time.  Maybe.  But, it's still really good.The sake selection is impressive.  If you want to indulge and aren't sure how to start, ask.  But, sake is expensive.  Often we will just have draft beer - which works fine.One important thing - CALL for a reservation.  It's best to call.  On a phone.  While reservations can be had online - the best times are not available this way.  Call.  You also have a better shot at weekdays than weekends, especially in the cold months.
Erika S.}Manhattan, NY}236}23}23}-1}1}10/3/2014}We would have had a good night, had it not been for how sneaky they were. We pointed to a serving of sake and even said the name and size, yet they told us another one would be more cost efficient and brought us another size. The size they brought us was 3x the price. This is a stingy and dirty trick that only a dishonest place would play.
Danai K.}New York, NY}1}10}6}-1}3}10/2/2014}The service is slow, but the food is good (I especially enjoyed the tsukemono). My boyfriend loves it and the ambience is great!
Speedy G.}Jersey City, NJ}1}74}1}-1}3}10/2/2014}It was ok. I didn't love it. I had 4 or 5 small plates, all of which were ok. I might try this place again, but I was not won over on my first visit. I dont even remember what I had. But I do remember the bill. About 120 per person.
Mark Z.}Cedar Park, TX}2}125}10}-1}4}10/1/2014}I really enjoyed my dinner here. Extensive sake menu, hot and cold traditional Japanese dishes (not sushi and the usual Americanized dishes). Typical smaller Japanese portions, good quality...prices pretty reasonable for mid-town. The duck was great. So was the miso yaki onigiri.
Margaret F.}Queens, NY}354}144}96}-1}5}10/1/2014}I've never been to an Izakaya before, but now I look forward to going to one when I visit Tokyo! Our waiter was super attentive and patient with our party of 9 even though we were indecisive at times (sorry about that). I definitely recommend getting a steamed rice to share (if you're ordering other things). We ordered a lot of different items on the menu and I can't remember all of them, but I personally loved the Jaga Dango. So fluffy and light, like floating on a cloud (or just eating a really delicious donut). The fluke carpaccio was great, too. I think there was a mackarel onigiri we ordered as well, but I personally thought it was too fishy; the others loved it, though. Also the pork belly was amazing - try dipping the donut into the sauce. Mmm... Oh and there was also a dish I forgot the name of where you put slices of beef onto a hot stone to cook it...get that.As for the dessert, we ordered several different kinds and I recommend all of them. My favorites were the black sesame creme brulee and the Pear Millefeuille.All that with glasses and glasses of beer made for a very lovely Friday night.
Linda D.}Apple Valley, CA}2}35}16}-1}4}9/29/2014}The decor and atmosphere were authentic and welcoming. The waitress made an excellent saki recommendation and I appreciate the opportunity to taste it before I ordered. We have the garlic oysters, crab rice, hirame ponzu and chocolate soufflé. It was all great! The only drawback is that we were looking for more of a sushi restaurant and they only had one plate of sashimi.
PD K.}New York, NY}15}75}13}-1}4}9/29/2014}Some dishes were better than others but I really enjoyed their dishes as well as the service. It was quiet and had a long meal. Loved their salmon and roe rice which I thought was the best. Will come back for different dishes!
Zeina C.}Philadelphia, PA}94}6}19}-1}5}9/27/2014}Excellent food, a great selection of sake, and certified sake sommeliers with knowledge and hospitality. I'm definitely coming back here.
Chris S.}Manhattan, NY}90}109}329}-1}5}9/24/2014}tl;drThis is THE izakaya in NYC. Bring your boss here and get a raise. Bring your friends here and get instant cred. Bring your date here and get la-- wait -- I mean, a second date. ;)---For my 100th review (finally!), I'll review Sakagura. Not that it really needs any more reviews, but I've been here easily dozen+ times and I'm really impressed at how good they always are.First, GETTING HERESakagura is hidden in the basement of an office building. If you see a white lobby on 43rd, you are at the right place! Walk past the guard desk and down the stairs behind a door to your left. Who says only speakeasies at NYC get to be sneaky with location?Second, WHEN TO GET HERE / INFO RE: LUNCH SPECIALSakagura is great for dinner. However, they also cater to the numerous Japanese businessmen that work in Midtown East during lunch time. Lunch starts at 11:30, and runs till 2-ish. If you come between 11:30-12, you can get seated immediately and you even can get an Early Bird stamp card that gives you perks like free dessert and such (make sure you ask for one - sometimes they don't give it to you). Their lunch specials are ~$12, rotate daily, and consist of a small rice bowl + cold or hot soba. It's not a bad deal honestly for Sakagura pricing and the quality is always consistent. Thursday seems to always be their chirashi which (to be honest) often fluctuates in quality. I usually like their cooked rice bowls more, which is usually Mon to Wed. Friday they have a kind of Japanese stewed brisket that is pretty good, but not amazing IMO. The restaurant explodes after 12:15 and it's sometimes even hard to find a seat at the counter during those times.Third, WHAT TO GETThe fun part! I've tasted most of their menu - here are the standouts:KAMO ROAST - tasty duck!HIRAME PONZU/FLUKE CARPACCIO - basically sashimi with a twist, but both are small white fish so it's a lot more delicate than the salmon/tuna you're used toBUTA KAKUNI - noms!GYU MISO NIKOMI - omg this is so tasty. i'm like drooling in my mind this instant. get rice to eat with it!!GYUTAN YAWARAKA - if it's not obvious yet, a lot of their standouts are their stewed dishes. perfect blend of flavor and fall-apart meat.SAKE OYAKO DON - come on, you know it is going to be good.SANMA ONIGIRI - who doesn't love mackerel??Here are the ones in the excellent category:TAMAGO YAKI - some people really rave about their tamagoyaki - I think it's pretty good, but not life-changing. still - order it if you desire!ONSEN TAMAGO - same as aboveGRILLED FISH - they usually have some rotation of grilled fish. they're good, but expensive. i prefer the hirame/fluke carpaccio, but it's up to you!NASU DENGAKU - good, but not superb. certainly get it if you've never had grilled Japanese eggplant before.KARAAGE - honestly, this is only here because there's so many other good things to get at this restaurant haha. ONIGIRI - to round out the list, their normal onigiris are pretty good too.Addenda:DESSERTS - they have fantastic desserts. certainly save some room for them at the end of the meal! we've started routinely getting 2 desserts because they're all so well made. for example, the lightest and airiest souffle I've ever had was at sakagura.SPECIALS - they usually have a listing of specials. a couple of them are actually amazingly good (for example, we had rice steamed with the juices of a lobster once and I saw in that moment how divinely elevated humble white rice can become). others are flops - for example, that beef dish where you grill on a hot stone (ishiyaki) is a gimmick and a waste of money.HOW MANY DISHES TO GET?Party of 2 - 3 to 4 dishes, with 1 rice dish, 1-2 dessertsParty of 4 - 5 to 6 dishes, with 2-3 rice dishes, 1-2 dessertsAnd after all of this, I've neglected to mention that Sakagura has one of the most exhaustive sake listings that I've ever seen. Thanks to the knowledgeable staff at Sakagura, I've actually tasted a couple different types of sake that I've never tried before. However, I'm still a sake novice and would still happily prioritize food over drinking here :)I don't know what else to say. This is one of the treasures of New York City, and if money grew on trees I would eat here every night.(budget ~$50-70 pp. after tip/tx for a good, filling meal without alcohol. more if you want to drink)
Jaime F.}Albany, NY}1}21}13}-1}5}9/18/2014}Been here a couple of times and I have to say it has become one of my fav restaurants in Manhattan. Starting w the location... It feels as if you're actually transported to another country. Food and Sake selection are spectacular!!! Highly recommended... Two thumbs up... A must if you like authentic Japanese cuisine. AAA+
Annaliese B.}Manhattan, NY}92}34}1}-1}5}9/16/2014}So good I had to review it while I'm still sitting here. First of all, hard to find. But I kinda love having to search for it and climbing down an empty stairwell to find this place. As soon as you walk in, it's literally like you're transported to Japan (though I've never been). The atmosphere is so unique. Food is amazing. Everything is so unique and flavorful. I shared with my boyfriend: the hirame ponzu (fluke with citrus vinaigrette), buta kakuni (stewed diced pork), the hot stone beef special, and the chocolate soufflé. I loved every single thing and there's so many other things I want to try. Plus I know the sake here is key, but I didn't try it this time.Instantly became one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The wait staff is also great! Attentive and thoughtful.
Rach W.}Gramercy, Manhattan, NY}1}110}5}-1}4}9/15/2014}They don't do takeout or delivery so spare yourself the walk over. Exclusively dine-in only and the food is superb and delicious. Try to book a reservation before heading over as there is usually a wait. Fairly reasonable lunch prices ranging from $12 to $20 per set. The daily special set runs out if you get there later in the lunch hour.Highly recommend the Jewel set but the portions are quite small. Daily set is a steal and comes with soba noodles. Overall, highly recommended lunch spot. Must go.
Keith P.}San Francisco, CA}6}217}1}-1}5}9/14/2014}i usually just come and ask for them to choose stuff for me, so i'm not always sure what i've had. great uni sashimi. great veal (?) in broth. love the onsen tamago. tons of sake choices. pretty high quality in general without being insanely expensive.
Kirk S.}Washington, DC}214}677}24}18}3}9/14/2014}Replicates the atmosphere of an izakaya well... if you're into that sort of thing.Sakagura is located in the basement of a building down some stairs, which means that it is the very definition of "kinda hidden."  It's somewhat strange, but not exactly a bad thing.The food is largely izakaya food.  Even in Japan, that's not exactly food meant to be a delicacy - rather, it's food meant to be eaten with beer and with friends.  There's nothing wrong with that, except that it's far from high-end cuisine.  I would eat izakaya food in Japan to fill myself up alongside an admittedly disgusting Sapporo beer, not because I had a major hankering for cheap-quality food-on-a-stick.For what it's worth, the food at Sakagura is authentic in that it is okay.  The Tori Karaage is pretty darn good and is very crispy and lemon-y.  The quality was so-so, which is normal for Karaage in general.  The Chawanmushi was decent.  I enjoyed the Jaga Dango, but wouldn't say it was exemplary.  Honestly, everything was accurate to what you would get at a similar joint in Japan: decent, but not great.
Carl W.}Baltimore, MD}1}78}0}-1}5}9/14/2014}Aside from the trip down the service entrance stairs, which I guess is all part of the NYC "how ironic" ethos, this place is excellent.Not sure what I had, but it was a bowl full of goodness, from the perfect rice, to vegetables and of course the fatty tuna. ala carte ebi and salmon also amazing. Even the seaweed salad was completely unique and delicious.  Along with Aburiya Kinnosuke, these are the best two sushi/japanese restaurants I've experienced. Can't wait to return for the sake next time.
Juliette X.}Palisades, Washington, DC}21}15}6}-1}4}9/11/2014}Great place to enjoy long missing Japanese food! Authentic and great quality. Handmade Udon is worth trying. My favorite is Beef tongue and the sake sorbet .
Meg H.}Manhattan, NY}7}23}2}-1}5}9/7/2014}LOVED this place! Went for dinner here for the first time with a friend and it was delicious!  We got a Noodle Bowl, the Cod in Soy Sauce, and the Pork Dumplings which we're the best dumplings I've ever had!  We ended the meal with the Creme Brulee desert with Sesame Ice Cream which was AMAZING! I don't even like creme brulee and we inhaled it.  Will definitely be returning to this hidden gem soon! Also as a note, it's a bit tough to find but it's in the basement of a building that looks like a apartment or office building.  When you walk in, you'll know you're at the right place because the doorman will ask if you're looking for Sakagura.  Oh and make sure you make a reservation.  We didn't have one on a Wednesday night in the Summer (aka Manhattan is pretty dead/not crowded) and still had to wait 40 minutes for  a table for 2 but it wasn't too bad especially when you can go around the corner and grab a quick drink.
Claude H.}San Pablo, CA}15}42}208}-1}5}9/5/2014}Get a real NYC experience.  Back of the building, down industrial looking steps, past the eerily lit janitor's closet... yeah, that's it. Sakagura.  Not a sushi bar. Izakaya; and it is phenomenal.  Fabulous sake bar, listen to the wait staff's suggestions.  They know whereof they speak. Must haves: kuro edamame, cod, fluke carpaccio, beef ribs.  Make sure your wallet is ready, player!
Stefano C.}Miami Beach, FL}135}41}0}-1}4}9/5/2014}After sushi leblon in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil it is the best Japanese restaurant. Only got to eat there as an appetizer because sushi is what I wanted and they didn't have. Price very expensive but at the end it is worth it. If you are in New York must try. Very interesting place with interesting food. Service well trained!
Will T.}Manhattan, NY}85}129}59}-1}4}9/5/2014}Walked in and got bar seating. Got the following:Fluke: 4/5Black cod: 4.5/5Uni noodle: 5/5Dessert: sake jello with sorbet. 3/5...so spicy for some reasonOverall great place, a ton of great options. Will definitely drop by again.
Victor T.}Lincoln, CA}61}49}2}-1}4}9/4/2014}Very traditional japanese, but not a traditional sushi bar...interesting tapas menu, and very few if any options for beer or wine.You have got to love sake to be in this place...I do!Plus: automated toilet bidet. costs about $5k
Priscilla C.}Manhattan, NY}790}208}67}18}5}9/3/2014}I've been here 2 times so far & I always have a wonderful experience! Staff is very attentive and nice & the food is really good! I would really recommend the beef waishu cooked on the hot stone, it was really delicious and an unique way to cook it. Another favorite dish of mine is the sake oyako don which consists of fresh salmon sashimi, salmon roe, and rice! It's soooo good if you're a salmon lover like me. Other things that I also enjoyed are the grilled squid and the tofu salad. Desserts wise I would highly recommend their chocolate soufflé ( it is chocolate heaven) and the black sesame creme brûlée !! These 2 desserts are so delicious!!
Jenny S.}San Francisco, CA}100}7}0}-1}5}9/2/2014}Sketchy entrance into an office building. Downstairs in a dungeon. Authentic decor. Feels like I'm in Japan. Don't expect rolls. Awesome food. I'm not even going to give you suggestion. Just ask the waiter some recommendations. Amazing! Best Japanese in NY.
Chad R.}New York, NY}231}464}8}-1}4}9/2/2014}Had a 20 minute wait on labor day evening.  I guess that is good..patrons were not american born, nor was any of the staff. Pretty authentic Japanese experience...many small rooms to give privacy. The food was pretty good..certainly not meant for the american palette..but that is a good thing in NYC...gotta be authentic or your just another restaurant. Had hot soba..it was a little bland..but thats why they have 3 variety of seasoning on the table. Add to your taste. I think this is great for 1st dates, great for visiting friends and great for all japanese. Otherwise..its a pretty good experience.
David Z.}Brighton, MA}33}17}6}-1}2}8/31/2014}Late post, but went here with a bunch of friends (6 of us) while I was visiting NY Aug 2 around 10pm.  The food wasn't really memorable for me.  It was good, but not for the price we paid nor for the service nor time it took to prepare.  The biggest thing I remember was that we ordered some simple ramen, but didn't get it until the VERY end of the meal after we asked about it (then it suddenly came out very fast!).  The entire time we basically got two or three dishes every 30 minutes - after ording everying at the same time at the beginning.  Why it took 1 hour or more to make some of the dishes?  No idea.  We ended up staying far longer than we meant to (1am) and didn't leave satisfied.
Sim H.}Manhattan, NY}55}71}4}-1}3}8/28/2014}This place is a hidden gem. You would only know about it through word of mouth since they're not displayed outside. It gets very crowded during lunch (around 20 min wait without reservation) but it was worth it. Their salmon rice bowl was amazing. Service is fairly quick. Interior decor is nice, but very crowded - good place to come on a business lunch. It is very pricey.
Nora F.}Sunnyside, NY}62}577}3963}18}4}8/28/2014}We went to Sakagura to celebrate my stepdaughter's birthday. This is a famous sake place, so if you're a sake drinker then please, by all means, go here. We love Japanese food in general so it's nice to try a different Japanese restaurant this time. I ordered a lot of fish dishes, from appetizer to entree. They're all exceptional! The looks of the interior reflects a Japanese-style decor, from dining room to the bathroom. We had a very good waitress, very attentive and very polite. My stepdaughter loved her meals. She ordered "jaga dango" that looked like donut made of potato. I loved my "mentaiko" and some other dishes. Oh yes, please visit the restroom while waiting for your table or waiting for your food. Overall the experience was not disappointing but entertaining.
Meghan G.}New York, NY}208}153}96}-1}4}8/26/2014}Kind of a funky location - you basically have to go down into what seems to be a basement at first - but overall a very authentic Japanese restaurant.  Service is excellent, and the sashimi that I had was definitely very fresh.  They don't have wine - only sake, but  no complaints!  The only thing that surprised me a little was that they didn't really have a sushi selection (did have a sashimi special though).  Overall a great restaurant - somewhat of a hidden gem in nyc!
Peter S.}Fanwood, NJ}51}8}0}-1}5}8/24/2014}This was our first time at Sakagura (or any izakaya) and we will definitely be back. The atmosphere is just perfect. You have no idea that you are going into a restaurant until you walk in and then you are transported to a different world, where sake and delicious food reign. We started with sake that was recommended based on our taste, and had the edamame (great!), hirame ponzu (spectacular!) and shiromi nanban, which was delicious. Then we had chawanmushi, which is hard to describe other than amazing. The surumeika was the best squid I've had since Bella Luna in JP. We finished with the beef slices cooked in a hot stone, the awesome sardine crackers and more (different) sake. Wow. What a meal!If you don't know what these dishes are, no worries! I didn't either! Look on their site, and check out the menus. Then go there and enjoy!
Josh F.}Long Island City, NY}114}239}44}-1}4}8/21/2014}Start your weekend early with Thursday lunch at Sakagura! Your meal will begin with a leisurely perusal of the endless and frightening menu, sake pairing menu, non-pairing sake menu, sake sake sake something sake, lunch tasting with pairing, and for God's sake, don't forget God's sake. Why hath thou for sake me?You will meet many waiters and each one then disappears. Or possibly they are the same man, a Faceless Man from Game of Thrones. The sushi will be excellent. The three-tiered platter of fried and fish and meatiness will combine with the sake pairing to eat up all the real estate on your table. You will move around it. The food is good. It is not noon anymore. It is 2pm now.
Catherine W.}Littleton, MA}40}833}28}18}4}8/11/2014}Enjoyed the izakaya selections on the menu. Our favorites were the beef tongue, sashimi appetizer, and the fluke carpaccio. I also liked the rice balls. Would pass on the seaweed appetizer (didn't really like the taste) and the chicken meatballs (a kid-friendly option, but really nothing special). Service was good, though the hostess when we first walked in had a mean face and attitude.
Paula G.}Manhattan, NY}1}15}3}-1}4}8/9/2014}When you arrive, at first you think this is not a good place but when you cross the door you find a very Japanese style restaurant with a good service and good food. I strongly recommend miso cod fish and rice with snow-crab
Yvonne M.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}2}8/9/2014}Overpriced for the portions. The beef dishes were good. The udon and soba dishes were a thumbs down. The grilled ika was half the ika. Soba noodles and udon noodles were a thumbs down. The waitress was uncomfortable or unfriendly. The busboys were better.  We ate at a downtown izakaya after for a better price and taste.
Carl C.}New York, NY}235}233}19}18}4}8/8/2014}Finding the actual restaurant is a bit like finding Wonderland. Tucked pretty nondescriptly in an office building, you walk past the doorman and find a door after a few curves that leads downstairs to Sakagura.After that ordeal, I had such a pleasant lunch at Sakagura with one of my best friends. We came on a Monday right at opening at 11:30am because we had a bunch of wedding dress appointments that day so we wanted an early lunch. Though this ended up being perfect for us because we found out that there's ONLY SEVEN servings of the Sea Urchin Soba each day. My friend and I shared one serving and in all seriousness, we would have ordered all seven. The uni and soba were so fresh and complemented each other so well as a cold preparation. This was a great appetizer for the table.We moved on to share the Lunch Tasting Course, which included sashimi, tempura, miso grilled fish, steak in teriyaki sauce, and some more cold soba.  It was a good amount of food that was more than enough for the two of us but there wasn't anything very memorable about any of the courses so I would suggest ordering the other soba or rice bowls.
Janet C.}Forest Hills, Queens, NY}0}4}0}-1}1}8/3/2014}STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE A LARGE PARTY! We had a reservation for 14 and the service was horrible. The GOOD:A few standout dishes but rest were average. Definitely try the beef tongue, washu beef on hot stone, and black sesame creme brûlée. Rest were just okay. Nothing to write home about. (Definitely had better tuna tartar, fried chicken and pork, onigiri, and seaweed salad.)The BAD:There was a minimum per person, $50, which was an odd policy but no big deal since we were planning to order drinks and a lot of food.HORRIBLE SERVICE.Waitress had an attitude. She told one person in our party at the middle of the table what dishes were sold out but people at the ends of the table didn't hear. When someone tried to order a sold-out dish, she responded, "Didn't you hear me before? We ran out of that." Wow, really lady?!She brought out a dish that no one ordered. Conversation went something like this:Us: No one ordered this dish. Waitress: No, someone definitely ordered it (points finger at all of us).Us: Can you show us the order you took so we can see who may have ordered it?Waitress: No, you will not understand it.Us: Okay...Waitress: If no one wants it, we can take it away but you will still be charged for it. Us: Fine, we will just take it......When the second-to-last dish came out, she came over and told us this was our last call for orders to the kitchen. Afterwards, we couldn't order any more  food. Then 5 seconds later,  a server gave away someone's dish to another person. He couldn't re-order the dish. Waitress was not accommodating at all. He was allergic to soy and couldn't eat the sauce that went with the noodles (that weren't his to begin with) so he asked for other accompaniments. He asked for a broth to which she said no. He asked for a dish of shredded seaweed to which she said no again. Her response was simply that all those accompaniments wouldn't taste good with the dish. The soba noodles had seaweed on it in the first place and he just wanted more seaweed! Needless to say, we didn't take the dish but ended up paying for it anyway.They gave out dessert menus while we were still eating our last dish, which definitely made us feel rushed. At this point, we knew they were trying to get us out as soon as possible. After such a terrible experience, we were surprised they didn't already include the tip (the best part of the evening). We left a below average tip (close to 15%) for below average service. The manager came over and asked us if the service was okay. We said "No, not really". He didn't apologize or try to understand where things went wrong. He simply said "okay" and walked away. Apparently, bad service runs at all levels of this restaurant.Maybe this place is good for smaller parties but definitely, do not come here if you have a large party. You have been warned!
Kerri O.}FOREST HILLS, NY}83}171}732}-1}5}8/3/2014}Sakagura is one of the best izakaya in NYC in my opinion. I really love the ambiance and decor of this place.  After walking down to the basement of a boring looking office building, you are surprised by how charming the inside of this restaurant is.  It reminds me of this famous restaurant I've been to in Roppongi tokyo called Gonpachi.  Maybe thats the style they are going after and I really love the mini village feel inside.  Their bathroom are hidden in 2 large sake barrels which is so cool but most people couldnt find it including myself so maybe not so practical?The sake menu is very long and a bit overwhelming, but i think they have like a sake sommelier there to help you choose your drink.  I got a glass of nigori and its pretty good, they also have specialty import beer from Japan, the one we chose had a crisp citrus flavor I really like.All the food we ordered were simply amazing!! We ordered the onsen egg with uni in cold soup, chawanmushi, maguro tartar, beef on hot stone, fried pork tenderloin and sake oyako don.  The onsen egg was the weakest dish of the night, it was good but did not worth $8 so I would skip it.  The chawanmushi melted in my mouth, but they topped it with sour plum and I didnt like the sour flavor but my husband loved it...The tartar's presentation was beautiful and seasoned just right.  The beef was very tender and the fried pork had the right amount of salt and curry flavor.  The sake oyako don was the star of the night, the roe was sooooo sweet and the salmon was served in the perfect room temperature, the roe was one of the sweetest and freshest I have had.  We saw their uni soba flying out the kitchen nonstop so it must be really good.. Maybe we will try it next time.For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle and the pear millemeuille, both were made to order and paired with homemade icecream.  The earl grey ice cream was so good with the right balance of tea and sweetness.  Both dessert were comparable to a 5 star restaurant and we were surprise they offer such elegant dessert at an izakaya!This place is a true gem, there are many izakaya in the city now but sakagura is in a different level.  My husband is from Japan and he agrees sakagura serves very authentic japanese meal and he loves it here as well.  Their menu is pretty extensive so some items might be a hit or miss but we loved all the food we chose for the night.  Service was a bit slow as we were there for almost 3 hours, it was a little hard to flag down our waiter and also they serve the food one dish at a time, but i guess it is not a bad thing as you can enjoy your drink and food without anyone rushing you.  Also reservation is a must, the wait on a saturday without reservation is over an hour.  We will def be back!
Allison G.}New York, NY}141}288}141}18}3}8/2/2014Updatedreview}I came here tonight for a friend's birthday. Having came here before, I expected nothing but the best. I was disappointed by the service for our group of 13. Our waitress was snobby and agitated. I was annoyed at the fact that there was a $50 min. spending per person. Food was alright, but the restaurant ran out of all the good hot appetizers that contain meat: chicken meatballs, sakagura special of the day, cod fish, squid...it wasn't as if we were there at 9. Our reservation was for 6:45pm! How can they run out of the good stuff so early in the night? Anyway, probably won't return as the food was just ok. I'm turned off by the service.
Gunnar V.}Toronto, Canada}20}55}2}-1}2}7/31/2014}I suppose it's rare to get this many sakes in a western restaurant and if that's your reason for going (and you have money) this is a good place to sample some very good bottles. However if you're looking for a more rounded evening involving food, service and decor I would avoid. In that order, the good was mediocre at best. Any of the many Japanese/Korean restaurants around town will equal this at half the price. The ingredients weren't fresh and taste overall was of "frozen" and mushy. The service at the bar was very slow and innattentive despite us both asking in English and Japanese. The decor of the basement location still showed the concrete block walls and the accoutrements were just plastered on top. Considering the price I felt it was pretty low rent result. Changes in layout and menu could easily be made to bring this place in line with a true Japanese experience. I hope they will visit some top Tokyo places and emulate a little closer.
Abby W.}New York, NY}188}15}0}-1}5}7/29/2014}A new fav Quality food, authentic interior design, great service Great quality seafood
Jennifer G.}Boston, MA}480}307}457}18}5}7/27/2014}What a great dining experience.  I felt like I went on an adventure getting here.After seeing a Broadway show Saturday night, my boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, but nothing too heavy.  We were feeling Asian food, snacks/tapas style, so of course we consulted Yelp.  After extensive searches, Sakagura seemed to be one of the top options each time, so we finally decided to come here.We walk to the address where Sakagura is, and do we see a restaurant?  Not quite, more like a corporate office building!  Hesitantly, we walk in anyways just to check.  Turns out we were in the right place!  The guy sitting at the front desk told us the restaurant was downstairs.We took the stairs down to the basement, and I kept wondering, "Where are we?!"  At last, we see the hidden (sort of) entrance to the restaurant.  What a nice surprise!The decor is beautiful and welcoming.  Great for a date, very intimate setting.  The waiter told us that generally 4-5 dishes is good for two people.  After looking through their extensive menu of cold dishes and hot dishes, we decided on the following:Uzaku (grilled eel with thin cucumber slices and seaweed): cold dish - this one was okay.  Tasted fresh, but the dish wasn't anything special.  Gyu Miso Nikomi (shredded beef back ribs stewed in miso topped with grated daikon radish): SO GOOD!  The beef was so tender and flavorful.  I wanted to savor every bite.Ebi Stick (deep fried shrimp roll served with a miso sauce): shrimp rolls were good, but the sauce made it that much better.  I don't know if I would order this again though.  Gindara Yuan Yaki (grilled filets of cod fish steeped in sweet soy sauce): this one and the beef were my two favorites.  The cod is so soft and melts right in your mouth.  The mushrooms that come with it are so tasty too.  You must get this dish!For drinks, they have a large selection of sakes and beer (mostly sake).  I don't know my Japanese drinks all too well, so I asked for a suggestion from our waiter.  He asked what kind of drinks I typically liked.  I was looking for something more on the sweeter/lighter side, so he suggested the Umenyodo Aragoshi, which was a plum wine.  Great choice!  At first, I thought it was very strong, but the more I drank, the more I got used to the flavor.  Perfect glass of plum wine to complement my dinner.
B I.}MIDDLE VLG, NY}0}155}0}-1}3}7/27/2014}I was here for dinner. While the place has a nice setting and is hidden from the mainstream, the food was a bit a let down and sake is very expensive. Food - 3First, the place has no sushi. It's different Japanese food. This is ok, but people should know before expecting to find various sushi. The portions are tiny. They have a variation of cold and hot dishes and they are all fairly small and you need to take 3-5 to be filled. Noodle dishes take 40-50 minutes to prepare. They warn you, but we didn't order because of that. Now about the food taste. Some food tasted well, but at least 3 dishes we ordered were very bland and nothing special. Atmosphere -4.5The atmosphere is cool. The place is nicely decorated in a Japanese style. It's located in a basement, which I'm impartial about and think it adds a little exclusivity to it. Service - 5Very good service. Fast, friendly and willing to explain. Our server warned us against a certain dish.Value - 2.5Food is fairly priced given the location. The food is sort of average and the dishes are very small with prices between $6-15 for hot and cold dishes.Other: Sake - 2This place is famous for its choice of sake. I'm very disappointed, however. They have a huge choice, but there is no explanations in the menu about what each sake is like. Second, the server didn't offer us to try any sakes (i hear that's common from other reviewers). Third, Sake is very expensive and you get very little of it.
Eric Y.}San Mateo, CA}331}700}1315}-1}3}7/26/2014}Coming from the Bay Area (San Francisco), this place definitely doesn't surprise or dazzle. It's located in some weird basement of a business building. You might have to ask the security guard at the front desk to find the staircase to the bottom level. We had:- Squid- tofu appetizer- Some Eggplant thing- Kurobuta Karaage - nothing too special here. Feels to me that it was overfried without keeping the juice of the fat. Kurobuta is suppose to be fatty pork, but we didn't have that after taste of juice bursting in the mouth. - Gyu Beef on a Stone - This one was good! Tasty beef, the quality was probably between a wagyu and a kobe. It was cooked on a hot stone with a piece of fat. - Uni Soba - Also something that was better than the rest. But for some odd reason, it took maybe 35 mines to bring this one out. Honestly, it was only soba noodles with a sauce. They should have made the sauce a little more condense for more taste. As far as the uni, not a very tasty one. Pretty sure it wasn't Santa Barbara uni. Overhyped? Definitely! This kind of stuff can be had in my neighborhood (San Fran). And according to the standard there, probably a 3 star restaurant. I've had much better karaage from food trucks. Probably wouldn't come back though.
Arnaud M.}New York, NY}120}102}2}-1}4}7/25/2014}Great atmosphere and lovely place, great to bring a date, I went there after reading several reviews and because the pictures of the food looked fantastic. It was very good but not mind-blowing. They definitely have the most impressive list of Sake have seen.I would definitely recommend the following items:Sake Oyako DonWagyu BeefHirame PonzuOnigiri rice ballKamo RoastWill definitely go back.
Fressia F.}Williamsburg, VA}7}14}29}-1}4}7/23/2014}One of my most fav Japanese restaurant in the city! We randomly walked in this hidden spot and waited for half hour since we didn't make reservation. Food quality is absolutely five star! Every dish is delicious and delicate. But the service is really slow, it took the waitress forever to bring next dish/add water for us. Anyway, I'll def come back for the food.
A.V. C.}Manhattan, New York, NY}56}137}3}-1}4}7/22/2014}This was one of the best Japanese "tapas" style restaurants that I've been to in NYC.  The tuna sashimi was REALLY good.  I also really enjoyed the cold soba with plum dipping sauce and the Agedashi Tofu.  For dessert, I highly recommend the Earl Grey homemade ice-cream.  My friend had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, but I like my Creme Brulee traditional, so go for the Early Grey ice cream.  It's more of an Earl Grey Milk Tea flavored ice cream but still good.  Also, the location is in the basement of an office building, so it's an unusual entrance, but once you get inside the restaurant it's quite nice.
Chadsel C.}New York, NY}2}9}35}-1}4}7/21/2014}I went on Fri and was a busy night. I didn't have a reservation and waited for 30-40 mins. It's reasonable on a typical NYC Fri night. We went as a group of 3 and one friend came late to join without problem. This place serves very traditional Japanese dishes/tapas that matched well for sake. The sake list there is on the top tier in NYC and you can almost find sake of any region in Japan there. I love the salt grilled ayu fish there - very delicious. I will come back again definitely.
Helen M.}New York, NY}154}42}3306}-1}3}7/16/2014}The food was amazing. A bit small not good for sharing not a wise choice for doing that.  But overall the decorations of the restaurant was more like a village sence.  The bathrooms are in this large barrel.  In the female barrel there's a chair and a table. Male barrel has nothing.  LolBut when you get to the restaurant go straight to the staircase.  But instead we took the elevator o.OIt will be best to call in to rsvp a table.  They open at 6pm for dinner and I reserved a table for 6pm thwy don't open their doors until 610 or 615. But overall the service was good until the end when we start paying the bill.  When we were about to leave our waiter. Count the cash in front of us and asked if we paid the service charge. Our experience there was amazing until the waiting and the rudeness at the end.
Berna M.}Seattle, WA}1}6}3}-1}1}7/15/2014}I went there with my husband and my father-in-law. The nice hostess seated the 3 of us. We were looking at the menu when an unbelievably rude waiter named Kazuhiro came up to us to get our order. We first ordered 3 cups of tea. My father-in-law had an unopened bottled water he sat on the side table, and Kazuhiro saw it, so he told us to take it out of the table. We told him we won't drink it; he said we have to hide it and that they don't like to see it on the table, so we did. We ordered Tori Karaage, grilled fillets of Tile Fish, grilled fillets of Cod Fish, Udon (asked him if we can add salmon on the udon, and he said no, so we just ordered the udon with spinach). We also tried ordering gyoza, and he said they don't have it. I checked the menu again and saw that they have Yuba Shumai which was pretty close to a gyoza. I was surprised he didn't suggest it. We wanted to see how everything tasted before ordering more, so we decided to not order more at that time. He told us the food will take about 25 minutes, since everything we ordered was hot. Our food showed up in less than 10 minutes. The whole time we were eating, he never checked how the food was or how we were. Since everything was pretty salty, we decided not to order more, and just head back to the hotel and eat there. We asked for our check. He came with the check saying next time we have to spend at least $20 per person. We said okay, but at that point I was already upset. I didn't say anything about his attitude, since my father-in-law was sitting in front of me and I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable. Our total came up to almost $45, and my husband still gave him over 15% gratuity. I asked the hostess when we were about to leave how much the minimum was for ordering food. Both hostess were surprised that I asked such an odd question, so they both said at least $10 per person.Wth! Who does that?!! I will never go back there! I hope the owner sees this, and do something to straighten the waiter's attitude, because it's really disturbing. I've never encountered someone as rude as him in my life.
Jenny C.}New York, NY}179}42}34}-1}4}7/13/2014}Very interesting location. It's like a place for those who are in the know. If you're not looking for traditional japanese food, you wouldn't be able to find this place. With that said, if you like izakaya style food, this would be the place for you. You can have some cold dishes, hot dishes, some rice and noodles and an extensive choice of sake. Also since it is underground, phone service sucks. Oh no. Now you'll have to talk to your dinner companions. If you can't survive an hour or so of no texting, don't come here. As for the food~Must get:Gyusuji. My friend said that this dish was beef tendon. So of course I was disappointed to find that there wasn't any chewy tendon. However, it was really good. There was a lot of flavor and the sauce mixed with the grated radish was delicious. The beef was nice and tender and tasted like good quality beef. There was also some fatty parts that added sweetness to the dish. So I still liked it even though I was misled.Kakuni. This was also a very tasty dish. The pork belly was fatty as expected and the fatty part was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The sauce was sweet and I liked the hint of sake in it. However, I wish the meat under the fat was more melty as well. I feel like it wasn't simmered long enough. Because it was kind of difficult to cut apart. Not the easiest dish to share. Up to you:Tofu salad. Yummy dressing! The miso dressing is quite good but that was the only good thing about it. I kinda wish the tofu was homemade but it's not. And their choice of tofu was lacking in flavor. And yes, good tofu has flavor! for those of you who think that tofu is supposed to be bland. I also liked that the greens were shredded. It made it easy to eat. Amadai saikyo yaki. I like to try new things so even though every cell in my body told me to get the cod fish, I opted for the tile fish. It was not bad. It could have used some more flavor though, I don't think it was marinated enough. But it was grilled well and I like that it's not a fishy fish. But I don't think it can compare to the Gindara, which is more softer, creamier, and oilier (in a good way). Unless you prefer a drier, less fatty fish that is. Surume Ika yaki. This one was the least of this group. It's just grilled squid in sweet soy sauce. Nothing special. Tastes the same at any other izakaya really. The squid had nice texture though and it was also grilled well. But it was a little low in temperature. Maybe it wasn't ran quick enough. Oh and I think you get only have a squid because the body pieces were flat instead of a full circle. Skip it:Jaga Dango. Potato mochi donut. Sounds interesting right? But interesting doesn't always mean good taste. This one really baffled us. My friend and I really could not understand why the dish was on the menu. It was one of the hot dishes but it tasted like dessert. Just somewhat sweet and smelled like funnel cake. It came with salt on the side which was pointless and did not match well with the dough at all. The potato in the center was tasteless and the mochi texture of it wasn't really good. Bad idea, bad execution. I'd much prefer mashed potatoes or a croquette. Onigiri. 3 words: waste of money. It was literally two small triangular rolled rice with some topping on it and nori sheet on the side. It was impossible to wrap without smooshing the topping. Why didn't they mix the topping into the rice then roll it? I know it's just onigiri but you could put in some effort. Especially if you're charging 6 bucks for it. Although the Mentaiko and takana leaves had good flavor, I could easily buy them and put it on top of rice myself. Save the space in your stomach and the money and get the Karaage or chicken meatball like I should have done.  Other than the food, service was okay if not a little lacking in warmth and smiles. Actually, this place is more of 3.5 stars but I gave extra for the food presentation and simply because there aren't many higher end izakayas out there and although the portion is pretty small, it's not extremely pricey either. I'd say it's pretty reasonable. I'll be back.
Elizabeth C.}White Plains, NY}18}28}0}-1}5}7/12/2014}I realize that most of their food is a little higher in price, but this is a review for their lunch tasting menu which is an AMAZING value, especially if you share between two people (which you probably should, because it is a TON of food)1) 10 slices of sashimi (2 each of: salmon, tuna, fluke, yellowtail, scallop) - the highlight of our meal! I've actually never had scallop sashimi before but I loved it. amazing texture. I also don't usually like fluke or yellowtail, but theirs was excellent. 2) hand pulled cold soba noodles - soba had great texture, broth was just right3) tempura - I think we had shrimp, crab, pepper, eh, don't remember all the varieties. I don't usually like tempura, but these were pretty good. 4) miso braised cod - super tender and tasty5) beef fillet - mmmmmmm so good. just as everyone says6) dessert of your choice - we chose the black sesame creme brulee and AHHH SO GOOD, my favorite course of the entire meal after the delicious sashimiFrankly, I don't know how anyone can eat one portion by themselves; my boyfriend & I both eat a lot, but decided to split this (based on other reviews) and still ended up pretty full. Incredible value for $33! Alas, this special is only offered for weekday lunch.Other comments: Service was good, waiters were very patient but hostesses were a bit rude and huffy. A bit hard to find, we got briefly lost. Atmosphere was nice; clientele was largely AsianWould definitely come back!
Cat S.}Manhattan, NY}417}371}0}18}4}7/11/2014}Sakagura is a classic, upscale Japanese restaurant that is NOT sushi-oriented. Read: no california rolls or spider hand rolls here. If you're used to very Americanized Japanese food, this place is going to surprise and confuse you. We had the tofu salad, which pleased a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian. I loved the eggplant served with 3 kinds of miso, very diverse flavor palate. My friend had the fresh salmon sashimi don, which was very good as well due to fresh and well sliced sashimi (it's a skill!). The only thing I wasn't super impressed by was the dessert. We got earl grey ice cream and sesame ice cream. I'm a huge fan of sesame ice cream, but this one just tasted like vanilla ice cream with pieces of sesame in it. Lame sauce. The atmosphere is super Japanese. Clean and orderly and efficient. Service was fine, but I'm used to getting impeccable service at Japanese restaurants so the service level here was actually below my expectations.
Nayoung L.}Baltimore, MD}199}157}28}-1}4}7/10/2014}A hidden gem in midtown west. I couldn't find the non-descriptive entrance in an office building even though I had been there years ago. I went back for lunch this time and was not disappointed. You get a well-balance meal for about $25 including sashimi, cold noodle, vegetables, tempura and a piece of beef cooked to perfection. I love their presentation and friendly staff. The vanilla ice cream and soy sauce dessert was a delicious Japanese version of salted caramel.
Eugene C.}Manhattan, NY}10}6}0}-1}5}7/8/2014}Wonderful selection of food. Serves some of the freshest sashimi and sushi in the city! Lunch set menu is well priced and the portions are reasonable. Did I mention seasonal lunch sets with sake drinks?
zi x.}Manhattan, NY}3}171}0}-1}4}7/5/2014}Good food and good price. Salmon & salmon roe over rice, seaweed salad are enough to keep me come back regularly.
Alejandro O.}Bloomfield, NJ}62}18}1}-1}5}7/4/2014}Just wow!  Everything we ordered was amazing. The service was stupendous. They have over 200 kinds of sake. Since I don't know much about sake our waitress recommended a bottle that her friend in japan made--it was by far the best sake I've ever had!
Wenyen H.}Gaithersburg, MD}193}56}0}-1}4}7/3/2014}It's a nice sweet restaurant!! I love the beef over hot stone and uni udon, the taste was very authentic. The inner decoration is also full of surprise, thinking of two barrel-like restrooms.
Mariko M.}Toronto, Canada}193}844}1189}18}4}7/3/2014}I have only been to Sakagura once, but I really enjoyed my dining experience here. There are a few locations in the city, but the Midtown location was closest to my hotel. You're not sure what to expect at first - you go into an unassuming office building, followed by an elevator ride to the basement and then a short walk into the restaurant. It's empty outside so I was surprised to see Sakagura jam packed with patrons from all walks of life. With a reservation, we were quickly seated. The menu is extensive with a lot of really delicious tapas style dishes. My personal favourite would be the cubed steak (a Japanese classic). Sakagura's sake list is long, but luckily the staff here know their stuff so I chose a glass of sake that I loved.Good for: dinner, groups, sake, Japanese foodN.B.: Reservations are a must.
Steph C.}Brooklyn, NY}468}752}318}18}4}7/3/2014}A beautiful restaurant hidden away in an unassuming basement location.You almost feel transported to another world when you enter the restaurant. It feels almost like going to a secret club. Except it's not so secret when the restaurant is actually very busy. We sat at the bar, which is actually nicer than sitting at a table (to me, anyway). The menu is quite large and it's difficult to narrow down your choices when everything sounds so good.Our dishes as follows:- Gomoku Kinpira, a small cold dish of Japanese vegetables and beef. Simple, but fresh and tasty. I loved the lotus root in the dish.  - Ika Shiokara, raw squid in a liver marinade. This dish was super tiny, and it would have been ridiculous if not for the amount of flavor that was packed in this. Wow! Crazy squid overload! It's a strong tasting dish, and gets overwhelming fast. - Shiromi Nanban, a dish of fried white fish and vegetables was light but a welcoming change from the squid. - Yuba Shumai was delicious, but not as unique as the other dishes. - The Buta Kakuni, the pork belly, was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and the broth was to die for. We also enjoyed a dish of grilled salmon which was very fresh and cooked perfectly , as well as an order to cold soba noodles. The server was helpful in helping us choose two types of sake, and served them to us in beautful little cups and decorative carafes. Overall, this place hits all the marks with food, atmosphere, and service. The only negative is that it is very pricey for the amount of food you get. But it's a place sure to impress.
Megan L.}New York, NY}351}5}10}-1}5}7/1/2014}Locating Sakagura was an adventure in of itself (read: New York's obsession with speakeasy spots). However, once you find it, you'll realize that it was worth the effort.The first to arrive was the sashimi from the tasting menu, arranged on a banana leaf. The tuna was not steaky but light, smooth and delightfully brackish, less in a metallic way and more in a seafood-umami way. The same cloud-like lightness applied to the salmon, yellowtail and mackerel, all of which retained their distinctive tastes without edging on the overly brininess that comes with not-so-fresh sashimi: in a word, these were the freshest pieces of sashimi that I have ever tasted. A stingy portion of asparagus in an orange cream sauce accompanied as an amuse bouche but, given that only 4 tips of asparagus were provided and that the cream sauce was almost negligible, this was perhaps the only fault that I could find with the dish. The highlights would have to be the scallop sashimi-so buttery! so subtle of a flavor! simultaneously subtler and more pungent than the flavor of a seared scallop!-as well as the dollop of crab sashimi mixed with Japanese mayonnaise and julienned nori. The crab sashimi presented itself as a mystery at first. Fibrous but soft, stringy but viscous, creamy but light-is it daikon? is it taro? It is precisely this cataclysm of silky texture combined with a not-so-overwhelming cream to mask a perhaps slightly less attractive natural presentation that makes this part of the dish brilliant.Next to arrive was their famous hand-pulled cold soba noodle with shiso pickles on the side. The hand-pulled technique-painstaking as it undoubtedly was-was well worth it: the noodles were perfectly al dente, chewy and alkaline. The dashi broth was not too salty and, in conjunction with the herbiness of the pickles, offered just enough flavor support for the noodle.Next was, arriving on a modernist English breakfast teacake tray, the main course of the lunch tasting menu: (1) shrimp and minnow tempura; (2) miso braised cod; (3) steak in a sweet miso sauce. The tempura flakes were so fine and crispy that they almost looked like lace. The tempura comes with a nub of shredded daikon that the diner himself/herself can mix in with the tempura sauce-a fun hands-on element in which the diner can fool himself/herself for at least a moment that he/she is cooking! The miso braised cod was tender but a bit overwhelmingly sweet: D and I speculated that this was the result of an excessive, propagandistic application of sake marinade. D claims that Nobu's version has more balance and more crisp. The steak was also a bit disappointing: we had asked for medium rare but received medium. In addition to a chewy, dry steak, the sauce-also heavy on the sake-was also cloyingly sweet.The jewel bento box was next and was, perhaps, not an excellent choice as a pair for the tasting menu. We received the same selection of sashimi, with the addition of a delightfully milky and creamy squid wrapped in shiso leaf, which balanced the tongue-enveloping nature of the squid with a stinging licorice feel. Sakagura perhaps uses more shiso than any other Japanese establishment at which I have eaten because their onigiri also featured the licorice of the shiso leaf, which speckled the especially small rice kernels purple. The onigiri paired well with the sashimi but there was perhaps too many of them. The onigiri was also perfect for the deep fried eel (as crispy as the tempura!), the tender pink and fatty pork belly slice, the boiled sweet potato slice and the marbled tamago with a surprise eel embedded within. The pickled vegetables and mushrooms were a refreshing side-the sourness and humbleness of which contrasted with the herb-y shiso and cloying sweetness of the previous dish. The nub of taro with miso sauce dripped decadently on top was also disappointing: although the sweetness of both elements played mediocrely together, there was no structure or sense of contrast. Therefore, the taro seemed like a last minute add-on. The high point of the bento box was the crab-shaped hash brown of carrot, sweet potato, onion and squash. If there is one thing that Sakagura has truly mastered, it is the crispiness of their fried dishes.The dessert, which comes with tasting menu (great value!), was my favorite part of the meal. By adding actual black sesame to the creme brulee (so that the requisite light tapping of one's spoon against the caramelized top ushers out a speckled gray ooze), the chef at Sakagura adds the much-needed extra flavor profile to traditional creme brulee. The dollop of black-sesame-streaked vanilla ice cream on top reinforces both the cream and black sesame flavor profiles as well as adds a temperature contrast to the dish. black sesame cracker arranged artfully as the summit of this wonderful triumvirate topped off the dessert with the obligatory textural contrast.
Mich L.}Edgewater, NJ}195}228}33}-1}5}6/30/2014Updatedreview}Back when I first wrote my review, everything seemed so expensive on my college budget. I couldn't fully appreciate Sakagura because not only was my wallet super light, but trying to divide the portions between four people on our meager budget was...tough. The memory of being kinda broke and unable to savor the full experience of Sakagura kept me away for three good years haha. Recently though, I was able to return to Sakagura and now it's time to update my review:Tip: TRY the sake from Sakagura's extensive sake list. If you've never been a big sake drinker like me, Sakagura is a great place to learn to appreciate sake more because they offer a ton of authentic high-quality sake. Good sake really does taste different from sake bombs or the blah stuff at the all-you-can-drink places.Surprisingly, the menu at Sakagura is still pretty similar to what I had three years ago, which I think speaks well in this case about its consistency and quality. However, I decided to order completely different dishes this time.As for recommended dishes, one of the highlights was the Nasu Dengaku done three-ways -- basically, grilled eggplant topped with three different miso sauces. The texture of the grilled eggplant was tender and soft on the inside and the miso sauces were sweet, savory, and just so good -- especially liked the dark miso. Definitely recommend. Another dish I like is the Gyu miso nikomi - stewed short beef rib that is super-tender and flavorful. It was hard not to inhale this one in one bite. Finally, if you see the uni and caviar soba on a daily special, definitely don't pass the chance to taste really fresh, creamy uni soba in a generous portion size. Three years later, I can say that Sakagura does deserve five stars based on the quality and taste that you just can't really find too often, even in another authentic Japanese restaurant. Also, the prices aren't as high as I imagined -- they're in-line with the standard authentic Japanese restaurant prices in the city. Final tip: don't go as a poor student and don't go with a bunch of people if you're trying to gulp down a lot of food.
James S.}Washington, DC}43}218}37}18}4}6/30/2014}You would never stumble upon this place, and yet it's always busy. And it's busy with mostly Japanese folks, those who work in the city or who are visiting and told by those in the know that this is where you get the legit stuff. The style and quality of food is comparable to what you'd get in an upscale izakaya in Tokyo. Sake selection is very good as well. Don't bother trying to get in if you haven't made reservations.
Lili K.}Manhattan, NY}286}2518}159}-1}4}6/27/2014}This was like going to a speakeasy-go past the front desk, around the corner and down to the basement!  Haha.I came here for Friday's lunch special (each day is a different set).  For $11.50, I got the hayashi rice (hashed beef rice)-I liked the meat and the flavored rice!  Yummm.  It also came with soba-I tried the hot and cold (the cold comes with the dipping sauce), since my boo had the same order-and both were good!I also had their spicy takana leaves onigiri-you wrap it yourself, fyi!  We just ate it as it was.Even the bathrooms were practically hidden, haha.  Overall, it's a cool spot with yummy food!
Rima C.}Manhattan, NY}21}145}0}-1}5}6/27/2014}I wish I could give this restaurant more stars, for the service, the sake, the pretty ambiance, and Good God, the shrimp donburi bowl and fresh sashimi appetizer. My mouth waters just thinking about it. Everything here is such high quality, even the edamame was better than usual! Go. You will not regret it. Warning: restaurant is tough to find. It's in the basement of what appears to be a commercial building.
Jay H.}Manhattan, NY}8}33}3}-1}5}6/24/2014}As if you descended into a space-time warp and ended up in a proper Tokyo restaurant. Best saki selection in manhattan. Service is great, employees are from Japan and respect the diners. A gentleman named Masa helped my friends choose a delicious selection of saki. The food is traditional Japanese and is also tasty. All saki served in special decanters and cups. Presentation is wonderful. Come here and enjoy the experience
Curlygurl M.}Manhattan, NY}38}13}1}-1}4}6/23/2014}This is a real treat.  Not your usual sushi spot, or just another sake bar.  The subterranean location is kinda fun, and when you get inside it feels like a special slice of Tokyo.  It's not typically romantic, but because it does feel like a special hideaway spot, I'd say it's appropriate for a first date, as well as a place to get together with friends or colleagues.  Service is consistently accommodating.  The sake menu is extensive and the evening can get expensive if you are looking to try several styles.  I always trust my waiters and they have never let me down.  Food is also very reliable.  Menu choices are outside standard sushi fare, so make the most of it.  Again, I trust the waiters on what to order and have never been disappointed.  Pork belly is great, but be sure to share as it is very rich.  Menu specials are also very intriguing and well executed.Overall, the experience here is memorable in a low-key and relaxed way.  We always love coming here.
Rachel W.}Manhattan, NY}42}31}0}-1}4}6/23/2014}Def a fan here.  I love how this store is decorated, its hidden in the basement of an office building, we almost went to soba next door. This place truly reminds me of Japan, feels like i walked in to a restaurant in osaka. The food was pretty quick and authentic, i loved my uni and the black cod. My friend ordered the special which was the soba and a mix of sashimi, which was pretty nice as well. I do want to try their tuna tartar next time! this is a great place for a casual lunch or dinner. make sure you make reservation thou, it could be pretty packed.
Angela C.}Brooklyn, NY}190}114}51}-1}5}6/22/2014}I love Sakagura. I love the idea of it and I love the actual existence of it. It feels incredibly weird and kooky and Tokyo-ish to be able to walk into a basement in Midtown and enter this sprawling restaurant with a dragon on the ceiling and an electronic toilet in a bathroom shaped like a wooden barrel.The kitsch of this whole experience would make it worth going to alone; the fact that the food is also excellent makes it one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.The uni soba noodles are fantastic and maybe my favorite thing to eat during a disgusting, sticky summer night. The crab rice is excellent and a must-order if you have the patience to wait the hour or so it takes to prepare. I love too many things at this restaurant to list them all here but you can basically order anything on the menu to your taste and it will be excellent.I know this because once my friend and I came here and ordered so much food, they cut us off and made us stop ordering. Some people would complain about this but I appreciate it when waitstaff are able to save me from myself.
Chris S.}Orlando, FL}94}292}16}-1}4}6/17/2014}This place is incredibly difficult to find at first.  When you first try to find it you feel like you are following a path to a werewolf den.  Kind of a weird place to find but it is worth it.I was going to list all the dishes we had but then I remembered I have no clue what we ordered.  We did some sushi but really focused on the tapas like sharing of the small plates.  We had about 5 to 6 dishes between the two of us and were very happy.  Some of the dishes were aggressive in terms of taste profiles but it felt very authentic.  I would definitely go back but you need to take someone there that has an open pallet and is a bit adventurous.
Joanna Lynn H.}Chelsea, Manhattan, NY}716}8}19}-1}5}6/16/2014}Sakagura is among my top five favorite restaurants in Manhattan!I highly recommend the baked oysters and sea urchin.Sakagura has an excellent selection of sake. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is very attentive.
Ann T.}New York, NY}110}97}5}-1}5}6/15/2014}Downstairs of an office building. Can go unnoticed. Staircase is a tad sketchy if you've never been. But totally cute and cozy inside. Delicious sashimi platter! It included yellowtail, amberjack, salmon, fatty tuna, uni.  Extremely fresh fish. Just PERFECT! They're really open until late! Best meal ever at 11pm at night! The menu contains a mix of hot and cold dishes. They have a fair amount of raw and cooked fish. Tried the rice balls and really wasn't expecting much. However, was extremely impressed with how delicious the simple ensemble was. Love how it differs from many japanese restaurants in the city. You will not find the usual sushi rolls or alla cart sashimi here. Excellent sake menu. Can't wait to go back!!!
Elaine H.}San Francisco, CA}1181}1746}5606}18}5}6/13/2014}The spot was not as easy to find, and we were kept waiting for almost an hour, yet everything was worth it. We ordered duck with scallion, grilled cod, spinach and soup rice. Strongly suggest the soup rice with salmon, tasty:)we would of course not forget the dessert, and simply by following others suggestion, we made a wise choice ordering the sesame brulee! Next time, we will not forget to make reservation...
Emily C.}San Francisco, CA}184}625}135}18}4}6/12/2014}I knew I was at the right address as I saw the sign and confirmed the address, but upon walk-in, it's an office building. You go down a hall, and then downstairs into a basement-y area and finally a nice, swanky but still old-style Izakaya Japanese restaurant/pub! This was probably not intentional, but it was cool and seemed like a speakeasy.There were tons of people with reservations! We happened to drop by on a Thursday night around 9 and we waited about 25 minutes.The service (when we DID get any) was nice and pleasant.However, we did not get serviced properly for most of our visit here. I'm hoping it was an off-day.Strike 1: Upon walk-in, I got eye contact with a hostess, but didn't take my name down. I waited for ~5 minutes with no acknowledgement after that as they were working on other things.. ~5 minutes later, the actual host (another person) started seating people - thankfully he remembered that I was first and took my name down then. They told us it'd be about a 5 minute wait, which turned out to be more like 20. I don't mind waiting, but it's a different story when you're expecting something shorter.Strikes 2 and 3: Our server forgot about us a few times.. it took about 20 minutes between a dish (which was just raw fish) and then really long to get our card back when we paid... he was courteous when we did see him though. We weren't in a rush but I expected better especially since the restaurant IS really nice and fairly pricey.That being said, I think they do serve up interesting dishes of high quality and thought, and I would return. I want to try everything on the menu! Yes, it's pricey but for what you get, it's fair.We sat at the bar in front of the dessert chefs and servers so it was interesting watching their techniques and the little details they put into everything!ONTO FOOD, FINALLY:Onsen tamago: soft boiled egg w/ urchin & salmon roe - the egg was nearly raw, but I thought it was interesting of how all 3 ingredients were soft/liquidy and savory (most places like to do a contrast of texture and flavor). it worked though and was interesting. I like food that makes you think.Fluke carpaccio: fluke sashimi w/ salmon roe and olive oil - this was good sashimi for sure but I wasn't wow'ed by it (personal preference though, as the bf loved this)Buta kakuni - house special - pork belly in a broth - the piece was huge! (well it's $6). I thought it'd be small so we got 2 orders of this.. one is enough to share. don't order if you're scared of pork fat. it was super soft, tender and flavorful. i thought it'd be hard to break it down with a soup spoon but it wasn't the case at all!Black sesame creme brulee - I usually expect sesame to be a super strong flavor but it was subtle in this dish.. I did wish it was more prominent, but again, preference here. It came with ice cream and I felt that sort of took away from the 'creme brulee' crust. It was basically like eating a subtle black sesame ice cream/pudding.Returning next time with a reservation, an order of sake and an empty stomach and money to spend.
Rich J.}Yonkers, NY}83}535}156}-1}5}6/11/2014}Walking down the stairs to the basement of an office building in Midtown, you are transported to Tokyo when you step beyond the threshold of this hidden Den of Asian Awesomeness. Great Japenese small plates menu including a wonderful take on fried chicken and a solid tuna tartare. Sardine crackers were unique and very tasty. A sake menu that goes deeper than the Titanic (too soon?) Great service, amazing ambience....plenty of wood and uh, cool Japanese stuff.
Leticia I.}Sarasota, FL}86}2}0}-1}3}6/8/2014}If you're not that hungry or hope to eat as little as possible, visit Sakagura. If you're expecting to wait around 30-40min for drinks and want to wait an hour for your microscopic dish, please, visit Sakagura. The food, although authentic, comes in small portions- far too small for the price (and my dish wasn't hot). You can definitely find cheaper Japanese food (just as authentic) around the city. It's a beautiful restaurant with all-right-food. I ate a dollar slice pizza, right after (far more satisfying).
Lisa C.}Queens, NY}34}209}258}18}3}6/7/2014}Courteous waitstaff, good food.  Get a bunch of different dishes to share with friends as portions are small. Pricey.Try:Fluke carpaccio baked rice dish with lobster/snow crab meatTori Karaageuni soba (this was pretty good!)Atmosphere: quiet, dimly lit, casual
Lorainne L.}Manhattan, NY}84}13}1}-1}5}6/6/2014}Sakagura is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Although it is a well-known saki bar, I come here for the FOOD. I have tried ALL the dishes in the menu (some pictures in my instagram: LorainneMarie)! Admittedly, there are a few dishes I would never order again, but the hidden gems in the menu are a MUST TRY:-Kani Donabe Gohan (clay pot rice with crab and crab butter) (seasonal): I am obsessed with this rice dish and order it every time! The soft rice is filled with chunks of crab, and they serve it with red miso soup on the side. I love taking bites of soup and rice together. This menu item can be found in the special dishes on the front page.-Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg with uni and fish roe):The velvety texture when the soft boiled egg is mixed with the uni and fish roe is heavenly. I find it so refreshing (w/ a bit of saltiness).-Buta Kakuni (stewed pork belly):This pork belly melts in your mouth and the accompanying broth is mouthwatering.In terms of service: the waiters can be scattered, and the service isn't as quick as I like, so I would deduct half a star for that.TOTAL: 4.5
Dan W.}Leitchfield, KY}8}281}0}-1}5}6/5/2014}Went for lunch. Outstanding! Seaweed salad, tasting menu, and pear dessert. Phenomenal.
Alex F.}Manhattan, NY}4}36}1}-1}4}6/4/2014}Place is in a basement of a office buidingNice ambienceGreat Service !!Food is a must try, and puts a different aspect on the usual sushi bar, and focuses more on cooked flavors.
Gerard N.}New York, NY}0}30}0}-1}2}6/3/2014}In Japan some of the very best restaurants and sushi houses are housed in non-descript office buildings - frequently in the basement. Sakagura plays off on that mystique to create atmospheric authenticity.So , be ready to look for a building number with no signage outside and eventually you'll see  a small sign outside a door way in the building lobby leading to a steep flight of stairs. Don't come here with high heels or a wheel chair.For us die-hard New Yorkers , atmospheric authenticity can only carry you so far . In a restaurant , it's what you put into your mouth that counts...everything else is fluff.That's where this place let me down . After being lifted to the clouds with culinary promise and  positive Yelper's comments...I wanted to have an Anthony Bourdain moment...but alas it was not to be  .Dishes were bland and quite unmemorable after all the hype . They are stingy with the wasabi , which was badly needed to infuse the plate with some oomph!Sakagura prides itself on its'  impressive line of  sake  selections . While some of them would require you to break your piggy-bank , I opted for a reasonably priced  tasting.I am not a sake  drinker , but when in Rome......I was not impressed with the "subtlety" of the  famous beverage and quickly switched to a double gin and tonic . Sake  appreciation  is   an acquired taste .I realize that this place has a sort of cult following and they will endure long reservation times for access .  That's fine if you like it .As for me , I continue to search for my Japanese nirvana . Help me Anthony !!
Catherine N.}Burbank, CA}0}11}2}-1}4}6/2/2014}Nice dinner spot!Service was excellent. Great sake and food. Had the sashimi special, really fresh mix of fish!Tuna tartar with caviar was good, was not the best I have ever had, but good. We also had pork belly, spinach/peanut dressing, ebi stick, miso soup and grilled octopus.
Mary P.}Manhattan, NY}144}38}0}-1}5}6/1/2014}EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.  The food was great.  The desserts were great.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was great.  Even the bathrooms are great. All the food is deliciously umami without being overly rich.  We got the buta kakuni, onsen tamago, grilled squid, and sake oyako don.  Everything was cooked too perfection.  Texture was on point.  Squid wasn't rubbery.  Pork belly fell apart in your mouth.  Egg was beautifully runny.  Fro dessert we got the seasonal sakura flan and the black sesame creme brulee.  They are literally perfection.  And on the bathrooms, they are expertly concealed.  The bathrooms are large and cozy and clean.  The toilets are fully automated button operated bidets that open and close the lid with a sensor.  Very very nice touch.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  5/5 would recommend.
Anthony L.}Dallas, TX}5}171}0}-1}5}6/1/2014}This hidden downstairs place is a gem. Since it's in a basement, there's no cell phone signal which is great so your party can spend more time to talk to each other rather than playing on your smartphone. This is basically a tapas bar, but I would say the portion size for tapas is above average. I was pleasantly surprised. My favorite dish was the pork belly and everyone should get it. I would recommend people order about 6 dishes for 2 people. It is a good amount and still saves room for dessert.
Elle C.}Manhattan, NY}21}331}0}-1}4}5/30/2014Updatedreview}Finally came back here for dinner! And thankfully, my experience this time was much more satisfying than the one before (their lunch menu isn't all that exciting). I made a reservation for 2 for Friday night almost three weeks in advance, because their reservation fills up that quickly. We got:Yuzu Omoi: yuzu-flavored sake. It can be found at quite a few izakayas around the city. It's absolutely delicious! It has quite a strong, sweet yuzu flavor.Hirame Ponzu: fluke sashimi with grated daikon and citrus vinaigrette. This was probably my favorite dish of the day. The thinly sliced sashimi was so fresh and it just melted in my mouth. It went really well with the daikon and vinaigrette as well.Jidori Shioyaki: grilled organic free range chicken. This dish was rather disappointing. While I liked the sea salt and yuzu citrus pepper served on the side, the chicken itself was rather bland and tasteless. Compared to the similar dish offered at EN Japanese Brasserie and Aburiya Kinnosuke, this was a big let down.Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku: grilled eggplants with three kinds of miso on top. This dish was quite delicious too. I recommend it to anyone who loves eggplants. The serving was quite huge as well.Chawanmushi: steamed egg with chicken, shrimp, nuts and ponzu sauce. Possibly one of the best chawanmushi I've ever had. But the sauce was a bit on the salty side, so mix it well before you start eating! Again, the portion was quite generous as well.Tori Tsukune: chicken meatballs with teriyaki sauce. Good, but nothing out of this world. I've had better at Yakitori Totto and Aburiya Kinnosuke.Overall, I was quite satisfied with the quality of the food here. I would still say it is not as good as Aburiya, EN and Yakitori Totto, especially when it comes to chicken dishes. But there is no doubt this is one of the better Japanese restaurant + izakayas in the city. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time, the place gets filled up really fast!
Joe T.}New York, NY}6}63}145}-1}4}5/30/2014Updatedreview}Service is still very slow during lunch hour, good luck if your lunch time is limited to 1 hr!Finally, there's is WiFi by Time Warner Cable free for 30 minutes.Really? You can't install a router and provide free WiFi??? Or will it cost that much to provide 60-90 mind WiFi??  The sign about the WiFi service is so small and it seems so complicated.  (They have 2 SSIDs and each of them has a different way to log in?!?)F******orget it!I am so stressed out just trying to figure it out.  Maybe next time when I wait 30 min for my lunch special.  (Food is still good)
Rena C.}Boston, MA}4}6}46}-1}4}5/28/2014}4.5 stars but they won't let me include the half :(. Reason for half star off is because of their limited entree selection. Portions are small but 50x delicious (soo yummy). Definitely in the high end spectrum and I think it deserve it's reputation. Nevertheless it is an outstanding restaurant to go to for special occasions or just a once in a while thing. Oh if u plan to go in evening, take a min of ur time to make reservation, definitely worth that one min. Recommended: onsen tamago, saikoro steak, sake oyako don and sasame creme brûlée.
Osman J.}Manhattan, NY}152}256}600}-1}5}5/28/2014}Sakagura is definitely on my top 10 go-to places in NYC.Hands down the best japanese bar - great environment, food, drink, service, literally everything is great. Maybe you can argue that there's no phone reception there because it's located in a basement.Some of my must orders: - Braised beef tongue, this is not your typical beef tongue, it is literally like a beef stew but the texture is much different and unique, flavorful, comes with great veggies and sauces.- Buta kakuni, braised pork belly....just insane awesomeness...the pork fat really not greasy at all, the sauce with sweetness and a side of mustard equals perfection.- Uni soba, the uni was super fresh and flavorful, served will cold soup, some seaweed and wasabi.The crab rice, beef tataki, rice soup were all good choices.
Candia M.}Albuquerque, NM}43}165}13}-1}4}5/27/2014}We loved the food, the service, and the saki.  The fact that the place was full of Japanese and Japanese-American couples and families tipped us off that it was going to be an authentic dinner.  The server was very sweet and did not make fun of us for asking for a fork, and he recommended a good saki to go with my daikon salad (which was good but had a bit too much dressing for me) and the aged tofu that was really delicious.  The kiddo had chicken meatballs and rice and some miso soup, which was all very adventurous for us poor old desert girls.  We loved it.
Nicole M.}Manhattan, NY}4}89}2}-1}4}5/26/2014}Really great food and service! This restaurant draws an eclectic crowd. I personally do find being underground a bit unpleasant. I especially cannot imagine myself coming here on a nice day. Otherwise, this is a great spot to eat Japanese food that you cannot find at your regular sushi bar. This is absolutely a unique, transporting experience that I recommend.
Jeanna S.}FRESH MEADOWS, NY}124}244}52}18}5}5/26/2014}It's a bit confusing to arrive at this quaint Japanese restaurant, but once you do, it's worth the "trek."Dishes:- Onsen Tamago- Fluke Carpaccio- Buta Kakuni - Chawanmushi- SPECIAL: Oven-baked rice dish with lobster meat, crab meat, etc. Would order all of them again expect the special - the rice was a bit too dry for me and the dish was quite bland overall.Can't comment on the sake - we decided to abstain from alcohol that night.Would definitely come back.
Mike F.}Queens, NY}63}122}88}18}4}5/26/2014}This is not a food review!Spacious dining and bar areas. Fantastic decor and patient and attentive staff. I went here with my girlfriend just to try a couple of items from the extensive sake menu after hearing about this place from a friend. The drinks we ordered did not disapoint!
Jake W.}Bloomington, IN}1}2}0}-1}2}5/25/2014}The dishes were really good. Unfortunately the waiter treated me and my gf inappropriately. She forced me three times to order more foods, and when we say we don't want to, she started criticizing us and gave us the "look". I think her name was Eva.. Indeed she's the only reason I gave this restaurant a 2 stars.
Ju L.}Osaka, Japan}943}905}1235}18}3}5/25/2014}600th review for an unpopular opinion?! Seems about right...Temper your expectations! The high ratings are definitely heavily influenced by Sakagura's inconspicuous basement location. (It's not too hard: Walk through the bright office building lobby past the doorman, make a left down the hall and enter the 2nd door on your left. This leads to a stairwell. Follow it, and there you are. We arrived at 6pm and they were still closed, with one or two parties at the door. OpenTable showed zero flexibility, but I modified my reservation easily by phone just a few days in advance. Across 2 hours on a Thursday night, there were always several seats open.)No matter the price, the location, or the perception of exclusivity, this is no fancy dining. Everything was as gorgeously presented as at any Japanese restaurant, with typical izakaya-style portions, but nothing tasted particularly impressive. I've enjoyed the food quality far more at a casual place like Ootoya, and fussier spots with a similar feel (Zenkichi, Bohemian) have menus I would put above Sakagura's.1. Shiromi Nanban - The nuggets of cold fried mystery fish were completely soggy, and the fish itself too firm. It read more like an appetizer that restaurants would serve gratis, not charge $8 for.2. Washugyu Tataki - Another tataki in NY that falls short of expectations! Very mild in flavor and the beef was cooked through more than expected, but somehow without any sear on the outside. Lovely plating though.3. Fluke Carpaccio - Beautiful presentation, again. But I don't understand the concept of olive oil as a sauce. It's not like they used a super grassy/fruity oil, so nothing was gained in taste or texture. The fluke itself was good.4. Amadai Saikyo - This miso tilefish was too tough; incomparable to Zenkichi's saikyo cod or Ootoya's saikyo salmon. And thanks for using a cheaper, mercury-filled fish...! Children and pregnant women beware.5. Tsukune - Chicken meatballs, as good here as anywhere else. But no raw yolk for dipping?6. Chawanmushi - The savory custard came topped with a thick ponzu glaze that was a little overpowering. I liked the tender, strikingly green ginkgo nuts tucked into the egg.7. Onsen Tamago - A barely-poached egg sat quivering in a chilled broth with heavy cantaloupe notes (but no actual cantaloupe?). The egg texture was great, almost ALIVE. But such a tiny portion of uni! Aside from the uni stinginess, this dish is closest to a must-try.8. Agedashi Tofu - Somehow served piping hot but with the tofu's fried coating already soggy and gelatinous. The broth was heavy on the soy sauce and had barely any dashi flavor. Why is it so hard to find a solid version of this basic dish?!9. Tori Karaage - Huge chunks of [organic, free-range] chicken - but the coating (the gingery and slightly sweet variety) was too thick and crisp. 10. Salmon Ochazuke - A mound of rice sitting in a bath of VERY salty tea-scented broth. It was nice to have a hot, comforting item in our rotation, but even my sister refused to eat this after a few bites, saying it was too salty.11. Yaki Onigiri - Perfectly formed. In the end it's just balls of rice with miso glaze grilled into the top.12. Black sesame creme brulee - Delightful, and I liked how the orb of vanilla ice cream was only streaked with black sesame. But their black sesame would benefit from a deeper roasty flavor, and the creme brulee was too airy and fluffy. Someone in the kitchen got a little impatient when making the custard, methinks...Coincidentally, in the 2 weeks prior to our visit, I'd made both black sesame ice cream and creme brulee in my own very amateur kitchen (from scratch, b*tches!) - and I appreciate how easy both are to make well (...and better).Total for 3 people, no alcohol, after tax/tip: $130. For the quality of the food, I'd sooner go to Zenkichi, which seems to actually pay attention to the details. As for service, again I'd contrast Sakagura to other Japanese spots around their price point. Waitstaff were attentive, but the service elsewhere has tended to feel friendlier and more accommodating.I won't deny that there's lots to be said for ambiance and the sheer novelty in bringing guests here for the first time. It's too brightly lit inside for what's essentially a sake bar, but a successful visit to Sakagura should focus on the sake rather than the food.
Lani Y.}Rego Park, NY}66}83}129}-1}5}5/25/2014}With almost 1,000 reviews under their belt, Sakagura really doesn't need me to tout their awesomeness, but here I am! ^_^After walking down deep into the basement of a Midtown East business building, I was surprised to walk through the door and enter a fantastic Japanese foodie wonderland. Although I am not a sake fan, I do love shochu, and they have a great selection of this tasty beverage.My friends and I ordered a variety of tasty treats ranging from the melt-in-your-mouth  buta no kakuni (braised pork) to the lip-puckering umeboshi (pickled plum). Literally everything I put in my mouth was completely delicious and our waiter was awesome. He answered all of our questions and was very happy to tell us about the other restaurants owned by this company.Would happily go again!P.S.The restrooms are adorable :)
Ryan M.}Prescott, AZ}0}39}3}-1}4}5/21/2014}Food is fantastic. Waited over an hour for a bar side seat. The uni is extremely fresh. Saki is perfect. Wait staff we're pleasant. Portions are small and pricey.
Tian T.}Great Neck, NY}2}6}37}-1}4}5/19/2014}I like this place, lovely food! Like the spring roll( shrimp) and the uni soba very much!
Guy-Charles V.}Quebec City, Canada}1}2}0}-1}5}5/18/2014}Incredible experience.Service was great. Food was delicious ans the sake menu was huge.Everything we tasted was absolutely delicious except maybe for the dumplings.The sesame creme brulée is a must.
Bunny R.}Manhattan, NY}26}5}0}-1}4}5/16/2014}Stumbled upon this place after we found out that Soba Totto was all booked for the night. My bf and I were craving soba noodles for dinner and discovered Sakagura, which was right next to where Soba Totto was. We walked into what looked like a residential or commercial building. With the exception of the really small sign outside, there was no other indication of a restaurant there (thanks yelp!). We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday night. The decor was very cute and cozy, maybe something you would experience in Japan; very authentic. We both ordered the uni soba noodles which was on the list of the 'chef's recommended dishes'  for the day. It was absolutely delicious! You could definitely taste the quality of the the soba noodles and the flavor of the uni. They pour some type of uni broth on top of the noodles which I found to compliment the dish perfectly. This place does not have many main entrees. I would say it is the equivalent of a tapas place, just with Japanese foods. The portions are just right and left us feeling very satisfied by the end of the meal.
Debbie D.}Bayside, NY}642}332}66}-1}4}5/14/2014}Everything tasted great!! Ordered the sampler tower and a lunch special. I'd have to say that the hot noodles tastes way better than the cold, just a note when youget to choose! Everything is small, but the noodles can be filling so have some noodles with whatever you decide to order.
Jerome Y.}New York, NY}248}215}2}-1}4}5/13/2014}lots of small plates, good if need japanese in midtown east with interesting entrance and ambiance. bar is also comfy.
Henry Y.}New York, NY}371}711}1}-1}3}5/11/2014}If expensive sake isn't your thing, then don't bother coming here. I've been here once before, a couple years ago, with a few friends and remember the sake being expensive and the food portions being extremely small. ...This was still the case last night when I stopped by for a nightcap follow dinner right across the street. We opted for the desserts and a few select dishes from their main menu. When I asked the server what 'the weirdest dishes' on the menu were, he pointed to the tuna tartare (what...the...hell?) and some other fried squid thing. Dog. When you're working at a Japanese restaurant, you better hope there's something more interesting than tuna tartare on the menu. The fried squid came out bland and tasted greasy. The dipping sauce was some weird mix of sriracha (sp?) and ginger. I ordered a caviar dish that wasn't too bad but the fish on which it lay was soggy and ....wet. The soufflé that my gf ordered was delicious though...so there's that. I don't know man. I still think the coolest part about this place is the restaurant.
Diana Y.}New York, NY}321}294}493}-1}5}5/9/2014}definitely a favorite. for both lunch and dinner.for always: sashimi set is legit. very good quality for nyc.walking downstairs into the basement, the restaurant screams of japan. you have stepped inside a portal into tokyo's ginza district and you'll forget you are in midtown manhattan.now soba isn't my favorite thing so i usually will skip it, but if soba is your thing then this is your place since they hand make their soba. soba with tuna & mountain yam... i love mountain yam! and uni with uni with uni... with uni soup soba.dinner is probably better as you can drink to your hearts desire, have the gyu miso nikomi (mini shredded ribs with mashed radish) with some rice, some fried chicken, tofu salad, sake oyako don, buta kakuni, and again... the sashimi set... all will sate your desire for japanese food and you will be happy.reservations are recommended, especially for dinner since it tends to get crowded with the after work crowd ready to wind down.
Paul M.}West Orange, NJ}0}142}137}-1}5}5/8/2014}An atypical and terrific Japanese restaurant.  You have to be a little of a detective to just find it.I went with a few small plates.  First was a soft poached egg in a cold broth with roe and sea urchin (Onsen Tamago), everything was unusual about it with the egg being so soft and the broth being cold but everything really worked.  Next was one of their specialties, Buta Kakuni or stewed pork belly.  This is a very thick square of pork that is soft and delicious capped with a very soft layer of thick fat.  It is in a warm salty broth and is tender and awesome.  Third was the Tori Karaage which was hunks of fried chicken.  It was dark meat so it had a little chew but very moist.  It was a nice filler since some of the dishes are pretty small.  Last I had the Miso Yakionigiri or grilled rice balls topped with miso paste.  This was another good filler and I would have appreciated having this throughout the meal to pull off pieces to balance other more intense dishes and to mop of sauces.  Not as remarkable as other dishes but then again it is just flavored rice.  That said I would get it again.I made a note to try the Soba next time and to leave room for desert.
Harue J.}Manhattan, NY}12}261}31}18}4}5/8/2014}I used to come here often before it got much more popular and became hard to get a table.  I was pleasantly surprised that their food got more sophisticated (pricier, yes) and everything we ordered was good.  Their sake menu is so big but the wait staff is usually able to answer your questions.  It was during sakura (cherry blossom) season.  So they had, just like a good japanese restaurant, a dish to celebrate it.  It was sakura panna cotta w/ an edible sakura on top and sakura cookies.  Subtle flavor was so nice and nothing is too sweet.  If it wasn't hard to book a table, I'd come here more often.
Susan L.}Brooklyn, NY}8}59}31}-1}4}5/6/2014}Tried several of the most popular dishes and everything was great. It's been a month or two so I can't remember the names anymore, sorry. The most memorable dishes were the cold dishes though. My favorite was definitely the soup with an onsen egg, uni, and ikura. They're well known kakuni wasn't actually that amazing to me, maybe I was just set for disappointment with all the hype or maybe it just wasn't that great that night. The meat was actually kind of dry and not tender as most reviews led me to believe.
Olivia S.}New York, NY}629}577}956}18}5}5/5/2014}I am completely speechless when it comes to the quality of the food at Sakagura. Everything is smooth on the palate and the simplicity & freshness of all the ingredients is just mind-blowing.Sakagura is difficult to find because it's located in the basement of an office building so be careful not to miss the sign. But once you enter the restaurant, you are greeted warmly by the host/hostess. And this place is set up to look like an authentic restaurant from Japan. Simple yet classic.If you're a fish lover, please get the cod. Smooth fillet pieces that literally melt in your mouth... And each piece breaks apart easily with the use of a fork... Delicate and delicious! The ongiri it's also amazing. The rice bits are so smooth like little pillows and unlike other restaurants, Sakagura uses the additives as toppings rather than baking them into the ongiri. The salmon roe was my favorite - little bits of heaven just ready to beat in your mouth :)I will be back for more, especially for the dessert. Can't wait!
Tom L.}Brooklyn, NY}16}90}16}-1}4}5/5/2014}Came here on a Monday night and didn't have to wait. Service was not bad except that they ignored us for the first 10 minutes until we called them over and ordered an expensive sake. Then we got great service. All the food were excellent and the prices were fair. The sake was expensive but was good. Bathrooms were clean. The sashimi was very fresh but it was $55 for 15 pieces!Tip: they have Japanese toilets. This is the ones that sprays water to clean you after you are done. Give it a try. I like it...lol
Ian G.}Falls Church, VA}21}31}0}-1}4}5/5/2014}Biggest sake menu I've ever seen.  Authentic and delicious.  Get the potato donuts - they will make you happy.
Danny P.}New York, NY}766}178}43}-1}4}5/5/2014}This hidden treasure awaits you in a basement hidden amongst the streets of Times Square. This Japanese restaurant is a restaurant of appetizers, tapas style, where there are 'many to choose from' appetizer sized dishes, in which, you share amongst your party. The dishes here are flavorsome and tasty. Many dishes are needed to get full, so try everything!
Flo O.}Tucson, AZ}7}42}12}-1}3}5/3/2014}First dining experience I would have given it a 4, second experience a 2. Food is excellent, service greatly varies.1. For a place that essentially serves tapas style, we were forgotten more than a few times. The point of constantly serving the dishes is so the customers can keep eating and forgetting them certainly makes for hungrier guests.Other than that I recommend the squid and the miso rice ball.2. Second time we went customer service was atrocious. Called ahead and made reservations for 8, they made us wait 10 more minutes once we got there. I get that sometimes restaurants are at the mercy of customers just not leaving, but when we entered past the reception area there were more than a few empty tables spread all around.This time we had ordered mostly fried foods (the karaage is amazing) but we were kept waiting on food for 50 more minutes. Again we were forgotten when it came to refilling our drinks and simply taking plates away to make room for more. The icing on the cake was after we received our check and didn't tip 15%--the floor manager comes up to the table with the bill in hand saying "I noticed the comment you left on the bill, was there anything wrong with your dining experience." While I appreciate the effort in wanting to identify opportunities in their work flow, coming up to the table with the bill is rude, confrontational, and misguided. The comment on the bill was a poor tip, no words were used.Honestly, I would go back only for the food. Maybe a third time can change my mind on the consistency of this place.
Han Y.}Los Angeles, CA}103}228}78}18}5}4/29/2014}Health Grade: AI would come here everyday if I could. I've been here a few times and I've enjoyed it everytime. I always make a reservation, so I've never had to wait for long - at most 5 minutes. The service is nice and they let you taste the sake before buying it (I think). The food is delicious. There's this cold dish with fish, mushrooms, and vinegar that I order everytime and it's amazing. I've tried many of the dishes on the menu and even those that I don't like very much, I can still tell they're well made.
Sydney S.}Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY}0}23}0}-1}3}4/28/2014}How I want to give Sakagura 5 stars! But after the 2nd time going there for dinner, their service is showing more and more cracks.  The food is good! The fact that it's underground somewhere, makes it even cooler. But the service....The 1st time I went there, we were done with dinner, the place started to clear out and they asked if we could free up the table, because there was a queue outside. Uhm, there were 2 people waiting. Seriously?! 2nd time we went there, the oysters were soooo chewy, i couldn't even bite it nor swallow it. My friend had the same issue. So we called the waitress and asked if this is normal, coz I'm not unfamiliar with oysters, and this was just not eatable. The waitress said she would check with the chef and eventually came back and told us they would cancel this from our total bill and asked if we wanted something else instead. Good way of solving this I thought. Then the head waiter comes in and says that they will still charge us for the oysters. Uhm, hello, your colleague just said something different. After lots of going back and forth, they still deleted it from our bill. Oh, and that was after the insult that maybe we are not familiar with oysters...Why would you say this to your complaining customer? So, word of advice Sakagura: Improve your service! Then you'll be worth 5 stars:)
Ben W.}New York, NY}516}773}435}18}3}4/28/2014}A taste of Japan tucked underneath the city. Literally.This restaurant is actually underground and unless you know where you're going, I'm confident you would never happen across it yourself. We all decided to pop in for lunch one afternoon as we were craving Japanese food.We needed to wait for about 10 minutes for a table of 5, although couples were seated almost immediately upon entry. Their menu has a wide selection of sets, soba, and rice bowls, and they have a limited number (30) of lunch specials which we were unfortunately too late to get. For $12, you get a full set based on which day of the week it is. I opted for the maguro tororo on the regular menu because I was in the mood for some delicious cold soba.The wait for our food was definitely well over 20 minutes. If you're looking for a quick work lunch, this is NOT your place. I was actually surprised how relaxed everyone around me was, given the fact that we were in midtown and everyone was in suits.The actual noodles were not a highlight. First off, the portions are tiny. It was literally a fistful of soba, six 1-inch cubes of tuna, a helping of shaved yam, and some seaweed strips, no more. I devoured the noodles in about four bites. Some of the tuna cubes were actually already browning. And it was just an overall disappointing dish. A+ for presentation, but portions and quality were not to par. The only tasty part were the pickled cucumbers: don't know what they brined them in, but I picked through everyone else's portions after I finished mine.This place gets more than 2 stars because it has so much potential. If on time, the lunch special I believe is more than worth it. However, their regular lunch menu was very underwhelming and doesn't deserve a  huge nod.
Ernest S.}New York, NY}10}287}22}-1}5}4/27/2014}This place was excellent.  Well worth the trip to the area, even if you aren't staying around there.  Most everything we had, including the tuna tartar, chicken karaage, udon, and sesame creme brûlée were excellent.  The only mediocre dish was the steak dish - so avoid that.  But it was a minor misstep.
Mike H.}New York, NY}154}103}367}18}5}4/27/2014}This is definitely one of the top Japanese restaurants in the city. The menu is very playful and offers a diversity of authentic Japanese cuisines. What I like most is that the chef is not shy about giving a distinctively bold flavor to each dish.
M K.}Honolulu, HI}1}2}1}-1}1}4/23/2014}Believe me at Sakagura, food is great! However me and my brother had a WORST experience with one of their staffs. My brother was visiting from Japan, we were planning to have great time at this restaurant spent good $200. There was one guy staff (Takuya K on receipt) with attitude constantly rude to us when he serves food, take order, put plates on the table, etc. Even though we liked their food, when we finished eating and were walking toward the entrance, the guy was following us asking us for more tip!!! I'm like, you DON'T even deserve DOUBLE TAX!!! Since then, I haven't went back to this restaurant. Too bad, the food is great quality, but there is the WORST staff ever.
Khang D.}San Juan, Puerto Rico}0}8}2}-1}5}4/22/2014}We selected to go to this place based on the great reviews. Great japanese tapas and the longest list of sake selection I've ever seen! The maguro tuna, black cod, eggplant and fried ell were delicious. And the black sesame creme brule, wow out of this world! And the sake that our waiter had recommended (Daiginjo Dassai 39) was so good and full of flavors that we went out to buy the same bottle the next day lol I would recommend this place without hesitation.
Shaun And Linda B.}Manhattan, NY}0}33}0}-1}4}4/22/2014}This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city. I come here regularly for lunch and the sushi is always fresh and delicious. This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's definitely worth checking out! The service is great and their sake is delicious too!
Joakim B.}Stockholm, Sweden}0}7}0}-1}5}4/21/2014}Genuine Japanese cuisine! We had the lunch set menu with sashimi, soba, pickles, tempura, grilled fish and some glazed meat. It was super and the surroundings felt like being back in Japan. Even the staff spoke Japanese and the majority of the guests as well.
Ellie H.}Jersey City, NJ}1}62}15}-1}5}4/17/2014}The chicken meat ball is so delicious! Desert is also very nice, especially Chocolate Soufflé. Seaweed salad with sesame sauce is nice too.Great food and nice place.
Dean I.}Lincoln, CA}20}209}8}-1}5}4/10/2014}Holy shit man! This place has some seriously good food! And don't scorch the sake like many other "Japanese" places. A little pricey but worth it to me. Great service too!
Nina M.}New York, NY}0}11}0}-1}5}4/5/2014}If you are up for something more eclectic definitely make the trip! The food takes a nice twist, and it is accompanied by the best sake selection in the city. Enjoy!
Tina W.}New York, NY}201}525}3735}18}5}4/4/2014}This place is a hidden gem! Literally. It's pretty hidden. The restaurant is located in the basement level of the 211 E 42nd Street building. The building looks like your typical office building.A lot of the dishes are small, tapas style. I especially enjoyed the uni soba noodle and the uni sauce that it was drenched in. The sauce was so good, I literally licked it off the bowl publicly with no shame. The hot stone wagyu beef was also good and you get to cook it on your own small stone. Sashimi was also fresh.The desserts were also amazing. Got the black sesame creme brulee and the earl grey tea ice cream. I loved both of them! I wouldn't end the meal any other way. I would probably come back just to get the dessert.
Takeshi V.}Brooklyn, NY}1}30}11}-1}1}4/3/2014}I have been the biggest fan for a decade and the entry is still the coolest but it's really gone down hill in the last few years. food is almost inedible and the sake has become ridiculously priced. for the rent they must pay (exposed pipes & conduit in an office bldg basement), something smells foul these days -- not to mention there were more non-japanese clients there than ever before, which (being japanese myself), is usually a sign that the quality is not there.
Kritti S.}Brooklyn, NY}120}59}406}-1}5}4/1/2014}Came to restaurant at lunch time. It was pack. I got 3 kind sashimi, chicken meat ball and grill cod  fish. Everything was delicious. Desert was great too. I definitely come back again.
Janet J.}New York, NY}25}28}0}-1}5}4/1/2014}Don't read... JUST GO.If you must...Once you make it through the street-level labyrinth to this basement gem, everything is divine! Sophisticated ambiance, fantastic sake list, and the food--every dish was exquisite, but the assorted eggplant was quite a treat! And do not skip dessert. We had the pear and the black sesame creme brulee. The pear was good, but the creme brulee will send you straight to heaven.
Nik K.}Brooklyn, NY}15}55}0}-1}1}3/27/2014}i heard so many good things about this place, but when i went there i was quite disappointed... here's why:- i like cucumbers and asked for a some to be added to my dish... they thought it was a highly non-traditional request and it seemed like it caused World War III in the kitchen! - because of the hype, there was long line and when we were seated we were told we only had 45 minutes to eat which is quite rude in general... and then they took forever bringing the food out, so we had to shovel the food into our mouths within 15 minutes- hard to find because it is in the basement of an office building! you either have to take a dirty freight elevator or a dirty stairwell down to the basement which skeeves you out- the black cod, tile fish and silky tofu were all just OK - not bad but not that good either... given the other ratings here, i would have guessed the food would be a lot more tasty :(- a bit too pricey for what it is... a small non-extravagant dinner for 3 guys was $150... in my opinion it should have been no more than $100... because this place is definitely not even a quarter of the "nobu" standard
James L.}New York, NY}49}31}0}-1}5}3/24/2014Updatedreview}soooo goood! cod is so good! seaweed salad so fresh and good, pork belly is good but tastes fattening....this place sooo goood
Deborah P.}New York, NY}4}157}2}-1}5}3/23/2014}Not just a sushi place! The sushi is quite good - but not the best in the city. Everything on the menu is great. There is a selection of Japanese bar food - fried shrimp balls are outstanding. These go great with a flight of sake. The waitresses will always take the time to explain what each sake is and what makes it special. In the winter, I get the miso stews - either beef ribs, oxtails or the chawan mushi. All are warming and Japanese comfort food. When you go, you'll see that over half the clientele are Japanese businessmen - a great recommendation. And the desserts are surprising good - don't miss the creme brulee.
Miss H K.}San Francisco, CA}450}961}2021}-1}4}3/19/2014}I came to Sakagura with a friend for lunch and enjoyed a nice meal. This place was tucked away in the basement of another building. Service here was very friendly. I made a reservation through Open Table in advance and glad I did since this place was definitely busy. I liked the atmosphere here, like others have said it reminds you of a typical underground Japanese restaurant-I liked the hot towels too!The menu also had some good options on it, especially if you like seafood. I've been on a soba venture lately so wanted to try the hot soba. The broth had a nice flavor to it and the chicken donburi bowl I also got with it was good too. Overall, a good combo. Prices here were reasonable also- more pricy than the cheaper Japanese joints but also not bad. Wouldn't mind returning again- a close walk from Grand Central Station.
Will S.}Fairfield, CT}81}48}0}-1}5}3/19/2014}I really don't know how to start this but.... wow!I had found this place on Yelp one night while walking around midtown. It was a Sunday night at around 8:30 so we figured that it would be fine that I didn't have a reservation. After finally finding the restaurant, which is hidden in the basement of an unassuming office building (with only a small sign out front), I was informed that the wait for a table would be 2 hours.... on a Sunday night... at 8:30. Needless to say, I knew that I needed to come back if that place could be that full at that time.Fast forward a couple weeks and we made reservations, were seated fairly quickly, and immediately asked for a sake suggestion. The group I went with normally are not fans of sake, but to say that we are not experienced sake drinkers would be an understatement. The waitress guided us to a pretty dry bottle, which was easily the best sake any of us had ever had.Of course the most important part of this all is the food and I can honestly say that this is the best Japanese food I've ever had and probably one of the top ten meals of my life. We started off with the sashimi appetizer. It comes with 5 or 6 different types of sashimi, which were all excellent, however the stars of the dish were easily the sea urchin and the fatty tuna. I cannot recommend this dish enough. In addition to that, we were also blown away by every main dish we ordered and the conversation that night centered around us trying to figure out which dish was the least phenomenal. The seaweed salad, chilled duck breast, salted chicken, grilled squid, and pork dumplings were all up there with some of the best food I've ever had.For desert, we decided to finish off with the green tea ice cream and the black sesame creme brulee. The ice cream was good but nothing I'd get again, while the brulee was excellent and something I don't know that I'll see on a menu anywhere else.If you have any doubts about this place, throw them to the wind and make a reservation. I guarantee you won't regret it at all.
Benjamin A.}Naples, FL}236}200}367}18}3}3/15/2014}The location is hidden in the basement and it's giving a little secret charm to the place. The decoration is good but a bit noisy. The service is quick and the waiter was excellent . Otherwise the food is arriving in a different order and not at the same time as the guest, ok if you like to see the other one eating, else it's a bit annoying. The food was good, the fish a little bit not cooked correctly for a grilled one, it was not cooked as it should. The rest of the food was ok but not exceptional. When I compare with the Robataya, I'm disappointed. The price is ok and not expensive. There was no wine at all, we welcomed the sake but it would have be better with wine. Overall, good place but not an amazing experience.
Gene E.}New York, NY}19}308}0}-1}4}3/14/2014}This place was completely fantastic. I can't remember all of the dishes were had but they were executed perfect. I did miss the fact they don't have sushi, but everything was awesome. Everyone at the table was very pleased as well. I hear that they have a really good lunch special.
Zachary B.}JAMAICA, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}3/10/2014}Great meal, interesting and fun.  The grilled squid and the fish crackers were incredible. Pork belly is a MUST!!!
Brooke B.}Manhattan, NY}5}20}2}-1}1}3/7/2014}Most important about this basement hideaway is that you will stink from the food all night. Do not plan a date here or a night out after.. Go un-showered and skip the perfume. It was fair food at best. The mountain yam looked like semen. It is not an overpriced restaurant so don't listen to that review. But wow did My hair n clothes stink from here, not going back.
Scott J.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}1387}51}140}-1}5}3/2/2014}Had an amazing dinner there. Very delicious. Overpriced but worth it. I had the six course meal including Waugoo beef. It was delicious but would've preferred that they made the state for me rather than having to do it myself. I recommend this place
Harumi U.}Theater District, Manhattan, NY}44}134}1815}-1}5}3/1/2014}When I talk about this place, half the people ask "wait, is that the place Anthony Bourdain showed on TV?"  Yes it's "that" place.What can I say other than sake selection and food are as good as it gets.  (I guess that's what 5 star means, so this is redundant...well, a correct statement can be made a couple of times)  Japanese people who come from Japan are happy with this place.  This is not a place where you come to have one big dish or sushi.  This is where you come to have Japanese so-called tapas style meal.  I went to this place or some similar places where I was asked "you know the food, you order" and I am happy to do it since I can eat whatever I want that particular evening, but if you are there without me, then be a bit adventurous and order whatever looks good to you.  You can almost never go wrong (I say almost because if you order food that contains ingredients you absolutely don't like, I can't guarantee with 100% certainty that you will like it, ha ha) and I think you walk out of the restaurant feeling extremely satisfied.Yes, it is a bit hard to find, but hey, that's what makes it more fun.  That is actually a part of the experience.  In Japan, many restaurants and bars are a part of big buildings.
Todd R.}Livingston, NJ}0}4}0}-1}5}2/26/2014}Sakagura always reminds me of the 2 week vacation I had in 4 different cities of Japan. Lots of styles / regions of cooking are represented, unusual preparations, high quality ingredients, beautiful presentation and great service (plus a long sake list). Small plates that give everyone a chance to taste and then order a second round of the table favorites. Best part is the price - we always over-order and the bill is ways less than expected. (Well, actually, the best part is the pork belly as pork/bacon trumps everything-- they should bottle the broth and sell it as a soft drink!) As busy as it's become, I still don't understand why people don't put Sakagura in the same category as it's higher priced, less off the beaten path, competitors.  Shhhhh -- keep it that way!
Christine S.}New York, NY}0}20}0}-1}5}2/24/2014}Love this hidden gem! A must if you're into sushi & want a cool off the beaten path spot!
Lori L.}New York, NY}2199}595}6756}18}4}2/10/2014}I've never been to Japan before. This is a saddening confession, but upon stepping into the basement of the office complex at 211 E. 43rd Street, I think I've gotten as close to Japan as I'll ever be. First, a disclaimer: Yes, the journey to this restaurant is somewhat confusing. You may be tempted to turn around and head back, daunted by the dark passageway and the lack of signage. Don't.I called a few days beforehand to make a reservation for my group of four and in due time, my friends and I arrived here on Tuesday night for our planned dinner. We were seated in the midst of the main room, where we saw plenty of corporate dinners in addition to dinner dates occurring. The ambiance isn't too formal or too romantic, and you'll be tempted to take advantage of the multitude of sake options at the bar.As for the menu, it can be overwhelming at first glance. We stuck to some of the classics and between the four us, selected six dishes total. Our waitress was helpful in explaining some of the plates we weren't sure about and throughout the night, she checked up on us several times to make sure we had gotten what we had ordered as well as refilling our glasses. The only downside to the service was that it seemed that our plates came out haphazardly and there were moments when our table was far too crowded with plates. But onto the important part: the food.The Buta Kakuni is one of the signature dishes at Sakagura, and for good reason. The block of pork belly came in a small bowl and was some of the softest I've tried, a true melt-in-your-mouth dish. We also ordered the Agedashi Tofu, three slices of tofu that had a slightly crisp-fried skin in a soy sauce-flavored broth. There were several bonito flakes scattered on top as well, and the simplicity of the dish allowed the flavor to come through. The Tori Karaage, deep fried pieces of chicken, were crisp, well-seasoned, and served hot. And finally, the onigiri with spicy salmon cod roe were served with nori and pickles. They were savory, slightly acidic, and provided some much needed carbohydrates to the meal.Some dishes that were not as memorable: The Yuba Shumai seemed delicious on paper, though was slightly disappointing in real life; they were more like meatballs than the shumai I was used to, but were chock full of flavor. The Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku consisted of six small pieces of eggplant with sauces on each; I enjoyed the texture and presentation of each piece, but some of the sauces seemed to overwhelm the milder flavors of the eggplant.While prices here skew on the higher end of the spectrum, especially when portion size is factored in, the high quality of the ingredients and the overall experience is more than worth at least one visit.
Lynn E.}Long Island City, NY}93}44}48}-1}4}2/10/2014}It's like discovering a secret place where ninjas eat because of its location which is in the basement of a building. Authentic Japanese food. Love the food presentation, choice of different sakes and their dessert! Gave it a four star only because of the wait to get a table and the orders to come out. But well worth the wait.
Jessica Z.}New York, NY}2}11}0}-1}2}2/10/2014}Very meh. I had high expectations. Small portions, lighting is weird and spotty. Food wasn't very memorable. Maybe I was in somewhat of a rush (but 1.5 hours for dinner is not an unreasonable assumption), but it seemed that the food was brought out painstakingly slowly. I didn't even up eating much of the food before I had to leave. I was also expecting actual sushi on the menu, but perhaps I didn't do enough diligence.
Nancy C.}Atlanta, GA}0}28}2}-1}4}2/4/2014}Delicious sashimi but had to sit in the bar on a Tuesday night where service was "iffy". The arugula capers ahi tuna salad is divine-still a bit frustrated with servers.
Damon P.}Westford, MA}57}7}2}-1}5}2/4/2014}Amazing service, food, and sake selection. I was in heaven and couldn't believe my good fortune in finding/trying this place!
Ajay R.}Brooklyn, NY}590}611}386}18}3}2/2/2014}Eating here makes you feel like you've discovered a secret place.  It's tucked away in the basement of the building and you have to go down some ugly looking stairways to get there, but once you do, it opens into this beautiful underground space.It's izakaya style.  All the dishes were immaculately prepared and plated.  The highlights for me were the seaweed salad and the gindara.  They were excellent.  Some of the other dishes I didn't care for, like the Ebi Stick and the Maguro Yamakake... they were kind of plain.It might be harsh to give this just 3 stars, because there was a lot of good about this place... the atmosphere, the service, etc.  I love that the meal was well paced and we were able to dine and chat for a couple hrs without feeling rushed or waiting too long for food... but in the end, dishes matter.  I suppose if I went back I'd try other things.  Perhaps I just ordered wrong.
Joshua E.}Verona, NJ}46}26}6}-1}5}1/29/2014}Pleasant dining experience.  Cool place due to entrance. Food was great and executed at a high standard.  Beef tongue. Pork belly. Eel. Miso soup with mushroom. Buckwheat beer all exceptional.  Fish is high quality.  Service was b+ and waiter was present. Will eat there any day any time.  Fun food. Fresh food and exciting in many ways.
Bob P.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}17}15}0}-1}5}1/29/2014}What a find!  And it was a little hard to find because of construction detours, but so worth it!  Ai served me and did a wonderful job orienting me to the menu and best selections.  I felt so very much at home.  If only more restaurants had servers like Ai.  This is the most unique (and delicious) Japanese food I have ever had (and I have had a lot!).
Jenny S.}Pasadena, CA}2064}2481}6739}18}3}1/28/2014}you won't find Sakagura at street level BUT go into the building with address 211, then go downstairs to the basement to find this hidden restaurant! (almost like many of the restaurants hidden in Japan itself)we made an RSVP and even though our 3rd person was late, they were nice enough to seat us! (beware there's no cellphone reception down there for communication!)to be honest, the food was nothing to write home about but AT LEAST it's all small plates so it's easy to share! (although we ended up ordering way too much food for the 3 of us)---pork belly: so many people rave about this but it was DRY and way over cooked!---cod: a bit over cooked as well---uni soba: nice taste of the sea, although the noodles almost seemed like top ramen noodles---salmon sashimi & salmon roe over rice: fresh salmon!---fried chicken, tuna tartare, agedashi tofu, steamed egg: all just okay, nothing unique---black sesame creme brulee: tasty end to the meal but MAN were we stuffed.. those small plates add up quick in your stomach!---you also get COMPLIMENTARY hot tea after the meal!heard they have an extensive sake list, but that's just not my jam & i probably wont be back!
Dave H.}Houston, TX}46}32}94}-1}5}1/28/2014}This place is off the hook! The uni soba (limited to 8 orders per day) and SAKAGURA tasting course were dreamy! The freshness of uni was out of this world. Don't miss out on the desserts as well: kuro goma black sesame creme brulee and Japanese pear with icecream were the best!!!
Jeffrey M.}Woodside, NY}60}38}40}-1}5}1/28/2014}This is possibly my favorite Japanese restaurant.  All the dishes are put together with extreme care. Plating is beautiful and the food is full of flavor.  Our server suggests 5 to 6 dishes between 2 people.  It seems small at first but after we finished we were fully satiated My wife had a very strong statement for dessert.  She said that if she had to choose a last meal the black sesame creme brulee would be a part of it.  Part of the charm of this place is its location.  It is set in the basement of an old business building.  Unless you know its there it is very hard to miss.
Andrea B.}New York, NY}0}84}50}-1}5}1/24/2014}Besides the excellent service and atmosphere and the endless choice of sake, the food at Sakagura is always excellent and good quality. Small, delicious, elaborate tapas that are the an explosion of taste and delicacy.Definitely one of my favorite Japanese restaurants.
Derrick P.}Des Plaines, IL}38}35}0}-1}4}1/24/2014}Being from Chicago, I had no idea what a unique experience I was in for just FINDING this place.  The other reviews are spot on.  In fact, I almost got lucky finding the entrance, and if I hadn't carefully read many reviews on here I would have certainly never found it. I happened by an entrance door for, for deliveries to A DIFFERENT Japanese restaurant on the main floor of the same building.  I saw a tiny paper sign that said "Sakagura Entrance" out of the corner of my eye.  After entering, I was immediately in a long hallway filled with trash bags and garbage.  Not joking. I traversed down that hallway then another, then turn a corner near elevators and I see a security guard down at the end of that hallway.  As I approach him and begin to ask,  he points to a door way adjacent to him.  One more decent down a set of stairs, into the dark, and at the bottom I went through a set of double doors and was transported to the entrance of a Japanese garden. I was seated relatively quickly, and was seated at the bar.  This allowed me to talk to the bartender about the sake and to ask for meal recommendations.  He saved me from making some bad choices on my own.  He recommend a very smooth (but expensive) chilled Sake.  If you don't like sake, I believe your only other drink choices are 2 Japanese beers on tap.  The Hot Dishes are priced by the piece, but don't be fooled:  you only need to order about 2 different ones to get a decent meal.  The Miso soup was good. I also had deep fried mash potato balls (no, that's not a condition) called Jaga Dango, which were very good.  The Buta Kuni, Sakagura's specialty, was an incredibly delicious piece of pork belly in a savory broth.  I would have paid double for the same portion without blinking.  I then had the delicious Saikoro steak, diced steak with a ginger sauce.  I finished with the bartender's recommendation for the Miso Yakionigiri which was 4 fried rice balls.  I didn't care for them, but it was more a matter of personal preference because they were prepared perfectly. The entire staff was extremely friendly and polite. Thanks to Yelp and a sense of adventure, I was treated to an awesome dining experience that felt exclusive and authentically Japanese.  Be brave and try to find this place, if you dare!
Lisa B.}Greenwich, CT}648}473}244}18}3}1/23/2014}I have to give FULL DISCLOSURE on this review. This first visit to Sakagura was a bit of a fail on our part.  We decided to go on a whim without doing the full investigation into the story behind this cool spot.  I DID NOT KNOW it considers itself to be one of the best sake bars in the U.S.  We were just not in the mood after the night before to have anything but hot tea. FAIL, FAIL, FAIL.As everyone says...you feel as though you're entering into the lair of a Japanese mob boss.  You have to enter from 44th street through a service door that's next to a DIFFERENT Japanese restaurant.  You go through another door or two and down some stairs and next thing you know, you're in the cool, cave like space of Sakagura.So....with that, I will set forth to review the our meal.Further failure was to be had when we expected sushi, but were in for a much more Japanese experience.  We made an executive decision not to empty our pockets at Yasuda, figuring for one dollar sign less and lots of stars, we would get pretty good sushi here.Upon opening the menu, I felt as though I had opened a macrobiotic cookbook.  With ingredients like umeboshi plums, fermented soybeans and taro potato, I knew I was in for a healthy dinner and a real Japanese meal.Miso soup with mushrooms...warm, heavy and plentiful mushrooms.Maguro Natto :Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Fermented Soy Beans.  Fermented soybeans are an acquired taste.  They look absolutely disgusting. When you take a bunch of them, imagine humans trapped in an Aliens nest.  Seriously...it looks gross. They have a "these have been buried in the earth with dirty socks" kind of taste.  But, after a few bites, they taste better.  They're quite good for you too.  I as you can imagine was the only one who ate them.Fluke Carpaccio :Thinly SlicedFluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf.  This was quite good.  The fluke tasted fresh and the plum paste in combination with the roe and shiso really topped off the flavor.Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku :Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso.  The eggplant was cooked perfectly with the skin somewhat crisp on the outside and the inside soft.  For me, the dish was too sweet.  Jidori Shioyaki :Grilled Organic Free Range Chicken Served with Sea Salt and "Yuzu" Citrus Pepper.  The skin-on chicken by itself was tender, four pieces or so with a small side of the Yuzu Citrus Pepper.  Topped with the Yuzu, this was one of my favorite dishes.  If you've had red snapper, you've probably had Yuzu...it's spicy and pungent and lends a perfect taste to chicken.  I only wish there was more Yuzu.Saikoro Steak :Diced Steak Sauteed with Olive Oil Flavored with Grated Onion and Soy Sauce.  This sounded really exciting and was the most disappointing of the dishes.  The steak was tender, but the sauce was watery and kind of tasteless.Gindara Yuan Yaki :Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce.  This dish was also a highlight. The cod was tender and flaky and the sweet soy sauce was used perfectly. It was not slathered all over the fish.  It was more infused.  So the reason for three stars?  While it's a cool place and the service was professional.  The food was not overwhelmingly great or consistently memorable.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  I really want to go back and do it right.  I'm going to try some of the things that other Yelpers have enjoyed and get my sake on.The service was very professional.  Don't be afraid to ask for help and suggestions if you're not familiar with this type of menu. It's important because otherwise you could venture into something that might be a bridge too far.Make sure you check out the bathroom electronics.  They actually have a doojiggy that will make sounds while you do your number two, so as to hide your embarrassing sounds.  They actually have these in public restrooms all over Tokyo. The Japanese are very modest people.
Fay F.}San Francisco, CA}79}42}69}-1}4}1/22/2014}Sit at the bar and be amazed by the wine collection! I am light alcohol drinker but I really enjoy the sake and plum wine every time I come here. Small dishes are also delicious. We tried the three miso grilled eggplant last time and it was just perfect. Highly recommended for small group gathering and chat on a late night in mid-town NYC.
Poki P.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}1/21/2014}I always have a wonderful experience at this lovely izakaya.I love their food. You can order almost anything, even randomly and still end up with success..I have tried almost all their dishes, and I loved all of them. Also, the server recommends us good choice of sake whenever we go there and ask.they are very kind and helpful! I always end up giving extra tip because I really feel good walking out of that place :)highly recommended!! I just hope they have less confusing way of finding the enterance though...
Xi L.}New York, NY}176}479}176}-1}4}1/16/2014}Man this is a hard place to find. First i walked into a Japanese restaurant right next to Sakagura and was told my reservation did not exist. Sakagura is a hallway walk down , down some creepy stairs and there you enter.This place is cozy yet large. Lots of tables, and lots of them next to others. Reservations are honored, and I had no wait to get my table I reserved. Service was also fast and friendly.Onto the dishes. Keep in mind they are tapas sized so order at least 5 dishes for a party of 2. Started off with beef ribs which were fantastic and melts in your mouth. The miso sauce base went well with it. Cod dish was also great, perfectly salted and cooked. The pork belly was also nicely cooked, parts of it had a little bit too much fat but overall just great. Eggplant 3 ways was pretty good too, the one with oyster sauce was not the best but the other 2 were pretty nice. The dish I did not like was the minced pork dumpling. It was overcooked and bland, and the sauce, which looked like vinegar was not vinegar, it was just bland as well...Had a chocolate soufflé for dessert and it was excellent. Overall a pretty nice place that you don't need to spend too much to have a good meal with variety. Also cellphone reception is pretty horrible down there.
Kenny Y.}Hicksville, NY}110}194}144}18}4}1/16/2014}This is one of my co-worker's favorite lunch spot therefore I was introduced by her.  You can't even tell there is a restaurant unless someone has pointed it out to you. However, I have been here several times for lunch.  The food is decent and it can get expensive depending on what you order.  I usually order the sasmhi platter that runs $20.  The deserts are amazing.  I love the cold soba noodles that is part of my platter.   Tip: Call for a reservation.
Risca P.}Elmhurst, NY}183}116}92}-1}4}1/16/2014}Wow, what a blessing to find Sakagura! I didn't know about this place until my friend took me here. It had an interesting way of entry but I was definitely impressed by the decor that reminded me of those old school anime movies I used to watch with my boyfriend. The host was friendly and attentive. Upon entering the space behind the curtain, I was excited to have my first dining experience at Sakagura. We were seated in the back, though I would have much preferred to sit in the middle where all the action was. Since Yelp gives this place a 3 $$$, I was expecting relatively high prices but I didn't really see anything super expensive on there. I found this a bit strange. Did I miss something?I had the Saikoro steak and he got Jidori Shioyaki. It was complemented with a nice hit green tea. My friend, who doesn't know how to use chopsticks didn't bother to ask for a fork. This is where it got interesting. He had one stick in one hand and another stick in the other hand. He scooped his chicken and rice in a way that made me wish I was invisible. I'm no chopcstick expert myself, but at least I used one hand to hold the sticks. Then, he did something the Japanese thought to be unforgivable. He stuck his 2 sticks in his bowl of rice so they are standing up and the waitress came and flipped out. She said, "No! That's not good! Never do this!" She took the sticks and laid them down on his place. I was just cracking up trying to save myself from embarrassment. Yea, Sakagura knows how they roll and I dig it. My friend was either too cheap to get desserts or maybe he felt ashamed that he wanted to leave as soon as possible. Sadly, I didn't get to try their desserts. I will be coming back, perhaps with someone who knows how to use chopsticks. And it doesn't matter what country you're from. You're in NYC, you better know how to act like the diversity has enriched you. By the way, awesome restroom. It looks like a barrel from the outside. Ahhhh!!!
Rachel W.}New Brunswick, NJ}56}19}9}-1}4}1/14/2014}If you order one thing from here please get the buta kakuni (stewed pork belly). The pork belly just melts in your mouth, and the broth it comes in is sweet and savory and makes you feel so warm inside. What I would do to just have a big bowl of that perfect broth and succulent pork all to myself, especially on a cold day! Get multiple orders of this, you will not regret it! The kamo roast (chilled roasted ducked wrapped around scallions) was another favorite. We also got to cook our own waygu beef on a hot stone, which was really unique and fun, although the beef itself was not anything extraordinary. For dessert, the black sesame creme brulee and the sake panna cotta were light and very delicious - a perfect end to the meal. Honestly, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything here is very simple but done extremely well, and so the flavors really get to shine and speak for themselves.The restaurant itself is not too hard to find, since there are signs both outside and inside the otherwise nondescript office building to guide you. The atmosphere felt very authentic and relaxed. You can also tell that they are serious about their sake - the selection was overwhelming, but the servers are very helpful in aiding your selections.Between the sake and the 6-8 dishes necessary to properly satiate a party of two, a meal here is certainly a bit pricey, however it is definitely an experience worth having.
Diana C.}Queens, NY}249}383}268}-1}4}1/12/2014}Even months after I dined at Sakagura, I find myself salivating over these dishes and I can't wait for an opportunity to go back.First off, it was easy for me to make reservations via opentable - automatic plus.Second of all - please note all dishes are ridiculously small.  I came with a group of 6-8 people and we each just got 1 bite of every dish.  I would rather do the dinner with a smaller group so I can eat more!Third of all - yes walk through the elevators to the back and go down the stairs. It seems wrong but it's right. You'll be instantly transported to an underground Japanese scene.Dishes of note:Buta Kakuni - this may be one of the best pork bellies I have ever eaten in my life.  It gets a bit pricey though - each order is 1 slice for $6. Completely worth it.Onsen Tamago - (Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup $9.00) - wish this was bigger. But the sea urchin paired with the texture of the egg was a great combo. Roasted salmon ochazuke rice soup - you start off thinking this dish is bit bland, but by the 3rd bite you realize it is a very comforting dish! I highly recommend it. Don't expect too much flavor, but know it just makes your tummy feel warm and cozy. Gyutan yawaraka ni - beef tongue - I don't usually eat beef but I decided to be adventurous that day and boy did it pay off! It was so tender and flavorful.Nihachi soba - this wasn't any amazing soba but I recommend getting this to just to feel full. Again, portions are very small.Jaga dango - (donuts) skip this. I didn't see what was so special about them.
Kristan C.}Manhattan, NY}2}12}37}-1}4}1/9/2014}Found this great, little, hidden spot after finding my way through a parking deck, hallways, and staircases. The building Sakagura is located in is under construction so I anticipate that their entrance will be more easily accessible when the construction finishes.  Until that time, you will weave through a maze of hallways/stairs until you wind up in a surprisingly bright and airy underground restaurant (surprising because basement restaurants do not conjure the image of bright an airy).  The restaurant has a lot of bamboo and is really cute, rather than kitschy.  (Check out the round, wooden bathroom in the front next to the hostess stand.) It feels like you're actually in Japan and the friend I went with said it reminded him of Tokyo.  The menu is pretty varied despite being a "soba" restaurant.  I had an uni soba special that was delicious and my friend really liked his seaweed salad and pork belly soba.  The seaweed was not just the neon green sesame seaweed that you get at a lot of Japanese restaurants.  It included a variety of different colored seaweeds with different tastes and colors.  It was pretty crowded at lunch and we did not have a reservation but were able to sit within a few minutes. I would probably recommend making a reservation, just in case, if you're planning to go. (which you should!)  The service was good and our waters/teas/drinks were refilled regularly. I will definitely be back for another visit!
Nicholas M.}Saint Petersburg, FL}81}121}15}-1}4}1/9/2014}Really hard to find but I'm so glad we did. Originally walked past it a few times before we realized that it was in the basement of an office building and the stairwell seems rather sketchy. Once downstairs you are transported to old Japan. They really went all out decorating the place. It really sets a cool mood, especially after the questionable entrance. I've been here a few times and always seem to get the lunch pre fixe. It seems to be the most bang for your buck with so many delicious items like miso fish, noodles, tempura, etc, etc. One of these days I'll make it there for dinner, but right now I'm pretty satisfied with lunch.
Brandi F.}Orlando, FL}401}216}293}18}5}1/6/2014}Not only is Sakagura a great dining experience, but it is an adventure to get to as the entrance is hidden in the downstairs of a much larger building that is under construction.  We first accidentally waked into a different Japanese restaraunt that is right next door, which is apparently pretty common as the bar tender gladly pointed us in the right direction.  I had called to make reservations that Friday morning but they were booked until 9:45 pm, however we decided to risk it and go around 6:30 when they opened and we were seated right away. The decor and staff have a very authentic feel and a good portion of the menu and sake list is in Japanese.  Our waiter was very friendly and glad to give his recommendations in pairing the sake with food which were all on target.  We had grilled squid, pork and lotus root shumai (these were SO good), salmon and bonita flakes onigiri and sake ice cream and jello and green tea ice cream with a red mochi sticky bun for dessert.  The first two plates were appetizers so the serving size was smaller but the onigiri were a good size and vey filling.  We sat for about 3.5 hours eating and drinking and offered to move to seats at the bar at one point, but those seats were all full and our waiter was glad to let us relax and enjoy our long dinner at the table.  It is on the pricier side, especially because the small plates and sake add up but the setting, service and food was more then worth it!
John R.}New York, NY}63}346}0}-1}5}1/6/2014}I've been to Sakagura twice and loved it both times.  Just finding the restaurant in the basement of an office building is pretty fun, but the atmosphere is great and feels like  you're in Japan (I've been!)  The food is also great - the first time I had the lunch special, and most recently I had dinner, which included the Chikuzen Ni (assorted root vegetables and chicken), Ebi Shinjo (shrimp balls covered with almonds), Sake Oyako Don (steamed rice with salmon), and the Udon noodles with spinach.  The last of these was the most delicious!
Jeff B.}Winter Park, FL}49}54}1}-1}5}1/6/2014}Some of the best all around food and service I've had in a while.Reservations were hard for us to get offering only a 9:30pm on the day I was looking to go but I think they keep reservations light because people stay for a long time. We walked in at 6:30 waited about 20 min and got a table. We ended up staying for 3.5 hours and others around us were there longer.Don't be afraid of this place if you don't speak Japanese or don't know a lot about sake. If you do, it just makes things easier. All except for about 6 of the sakes are listed in Japanese but separated according to region and style. If you don't know the implications of that the servers are VERY helpful and knowledgeable and will steer you to something that you will enjoy.The food plates are on the smaller side but the quality and skill that goes into them really shows, even their onigiri is superb. Normally I don't like dessert but they have some more savory desserts and not just sweet things which was the perfect ending to this wonderful meal.
Minsook E.}Manhattan, NY}26}9}13}-1}5}1/5/2014}Lots of New Yorker don't know this place.It's one of the best authentic place in the city.My husband and I have been constantly visiting this place over 5 years.
Samantha K.}New York, NY}116}130}87}-1}5}1/3/2014}This place is hidden downstairs a huge building. The sign outside isn't very big. Make sure you get the address so you know where it is. I thought it was odd walking into the building having to go downstairs.Don't be fooled by the building and the staircase leading downstairs. Once you get downstairs, you'll definitely get the Japanese vibe. The decor is really nice! There are Japanese curtains, bamboo shoots, and dividers.I've been here for dinner a few times. The names of the dishes are in Japanese, which I do not know how to read or speak. So I had to copy the names and descriptions of the dishes from their website. Every single time I come here, I always take forever to go through the menu because of the language barrier and all the descriptions. I was overwhelmed by the menu and language my very first time here. The waitress had to explain practically the whole menu to me. Also being seated at the bar where the chefs make some appetizers, desserts, and prepare drinks helped. I was able to see what some foods were.Hiyayakko (Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes) - This is a good appetizer to start off your palates. It's light and refreshing.Agedashi Tofu (Tofu Coated in a Light Batter and Deep Fried Served in a Soy Sauce Infused Broth) - This is another good appetizer. It's also light and refreshing. I drank most of the broth afterwards because it was really tasty.Ika Shiokara (Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade) - This is super unique and definitely an acquired taste! I ordered this once and will never order it again!  I had major trouble eating this! This is definitely an acquired taste, which I do not have and won't ever have. What lured me to ordering this was how unique it sounded.Onsen Tamago (Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup) -  Flavor and texture were good but I wish there were more sea urchin. This is a good summer dish because the soup base is cold.Buta Kakuni (SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork) - Each person must get there own! This is duper delicious and my favorite dish here! Like I mentioned in my tip, this is not for anyone on a diet because it is fatty pork.Onigiri Rice Balls - I've tried one with spicy cod roe and one with salmon roe. They were good but I wish there were more spicy cod roe and salmon roe given to make it taste better. It's a little messy for me to eat because I don't know how to wrap the seaweed around it though.Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku (Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso - (1) Eggyolk, (2) Spinach, and (3) Sweet Red) - This was delicious and unique. I had doubts prior to ordering it because I didn't think eggplants were anything special. But the three kinds of miso enhanced the flavor beyond my beliefs.Fluke Carpaccio (Thinly SlicedFluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf) - This had good flavor and the fluke was sliced well. The toppings enhanced the flavor of the fluke really well.Black Sesame Cream Brulee - My favorite dessert here! The black sesame has a strong flavor, which I like. It's also served with black sesame ice cream and crackersHannya Ume Sake Sorbet (spicy plum sake sorbet & jelly) - This was definitely unique, which is what the description attracted me to. I didn't realize how spicy this dessert would be until I tried it. Who knew a dessert can be that spicy?!?! Or maybe it's just me.Chocolate Souffle With vanilla ice cream & raspberry sauce - Delicious! This is my second favorite dessert here! Since it's a souffle, it takes a little longer to prepare because the chefs have to put it in the oven to heat it up. You can see them preparing it when sitting at the bar area.
Cissy Z.}Manhattan, NY}188}80}116}-1}4}12/31/2013}Food is great but on the pricey side. Also, make sure you call ahead for reservations. We got there at 9pm on a Tuesday night and it was still a 45 minute wait.Was instructed to meet at Sakagura for a date, and almost turned away because the entrance was just that shady. The restaurant is in the basement, down a long corridor in a random abandoned office building that is going through remodeling. My fears were assuaged though, upon entrance into the actual restaurant. The decor was very original; the tiny huts, lit-up giant mask and dragon made me feel like I was transported into another world.Recommended dishes:-Onsen tamago (soft boiled egg with uni and salmon roe): can you go wrong with egg on egg on egg? Delicious!-Japanese eggplant in three kinds of miso: the different misos highlighted interesting flavors of the eggplant.-Buta kakuni (pork belly): tender and rich, melt in your mouth.**TIP: I hear Sakagura has an amazing lunch tasting for $30. Will report back if I can ever get away from my desk to try!
Ivy S.}Staten Island, NY}117}57}171}-1}4}12/29/2013}So first off, like everyone else had said, you will get lost if you don't read up on other yelpers tips first.  It's located in office building, through construction, in the back, down the stairs, through alley, and voila¡ it's a spacious mini-Japanese spot! You know it's legit when the hostess is straight up Japanese style and staff speaks with heavy accent. Second of all, do not go starving. Dishes are quite Asian sized (mini tapas like) so you will not get full unless you order about $40 - $50 of dishes per adult.  Plus everything does sound pretty damn good so it entices you to order half the menu.  For all the people that want sushi (rolls and all), go next door.  This is straight up authentic Japanese dishes, no Cali rolls here!I'd also recommend it for sake lovers.  Good amount of selection.Decor - traditional ; good ambience Great for datesWouldn't suggest it for kids Coat check - yes Should make reservations Worth a return trip...!
Big B.}New York, NY}248}662}16}-1}4}12/27/2013}One of the best mixture Japanese restaurant I have tried. Very authentic. Sake is very tasty.
Frank W.}Great Falls, VA}44}760}110}-1}3}12/27/2013}Truly a strange location for a restaurant. We enjoyed the food (3.5 stars) but not the service (2 stars, inattentive waitress).
Tatiana A.}Atlanta, GA}0}12}0}-1}5}12/24/2013}We went to this place on a Friday night for dinner. The food was excellent. My boyfriend, who just came back from a trip to Tokyo, thought the dishes were very authentic both in taste and presentation.We tried a few things, and they all were great, but vegetables with broth were my favorite.
Michael G.}Manhattan, NY}0}66}0}-1}1}12/22/2013}A big disappointment. Somewhat hidden (because of the construction they want you to enter on 44th during the day but 43rd at night) in a basement but still tough to get a table the expectations were high.Miso soup with  "NAMEKO" Mushroom:  It was fine.Deep Fried Shrimp Balls Covered with Sliced Almonds:  if my eyes were closed I would have guessed it was chicken due to the undefinable bland taste of the dried out inner meat.  The crisp coating of almonds was at first nice but then only added to the overall dryness. The texture also gave no indication it was actually shrimp. Grilled Organic Free Range Chicken Served with Sea Salt and "Yuzu" Citrus Pepper :Tiny pieces of fatty grilled dark meat. Grilled too fast I guess because none of the skin had time to render and it was flabby.Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp :  this sounded like a bad idea and it was. Just a bad combo.Chocolate Souffle: how do you make a bad one you ask ? It would guess they make it in advance and reheat it until it rises again which would explain the mere 6 minutes until ready, the anemic rise and, worst of all, the dry tasting interior. The service was good. The ambiance was interesting with a nice looking bar.  The food was poor.
Jade J.}Philadelphia, PA}0}14}0}-1}2}12/21/2013}I don't like this place at all. I think it is overrated. I went with my friends and we ordered the duck ramen, duck curry ramen, and tempura soba. They are all really bad. The soup was way too salty and the noodles and soba is nothing special at all. However, their dessert is pretty good though . We like the soufflé and the pear dessert (we can't remember the name)
May Y.}Hong Kong}1507}198}272}-1}4}12/16/2013}Since 2012, I have wanted to visited Sakagura. However, it seemed that we were never meant to be - first, Hurricane Sandy, then two rainstorms. Luckily, I finally met my dream restaurant Sakagura today.Similar to a mysterious man who desires to hide from his fans, Sakagura is located in the basement. Limited Internet may be frustrating at times. Nonetheless, it finally pushes me out of the comfort zone and looks into the eyes of my friends as I speak to them instead of staring at my phone. Without doubt, Sakagura is like an ideal man - it not only has an elegant decor, but also provides amazing Japanese food. The sake bottles on the shelves of the wall, the rice bags on cupboards and the bamboo design of the bathroom made me felt as if Sakagura brought me to Japan for a honeymoon. The housemade tofu was so smooth and silky that it slowly melted in my mouth. Although the tofu might not be flavorful as I expected, I was delighted by the salty sauce used on the tofu. Sakagura seems to be an all-rounded man who is able to cook both vegetarian and seafood dishes well, which is quite rare. My friend ordered shrimp tempura and the sake oyako don. He loved the light crispy batter on the shrimps, and the freshness of the salmon. No matter which dish Sakagura makes, it focuses on the original flavor of the dish, and does not let the sauce overpower the food. Yet, like all men, Sakagura is not perfect. It has a limited selection of food in its lunch menu. I unfortunately could not try tamagoyaki, and my friend could not have Buta Kakuni today.Nonetheless, all restaurants have flaws, but Sakagura's flaw is minor compared to all its amazing offers, ranging from decor to food. I have fallen in love with Sakagura, and would love to get to know it more when I come here next time.
Yaima R.}State College, PA}46}86}0}-1}5}12/15/2013}Loved everything I tried here, very authentic, just like the Japanese food at good places in Japan. My favorites were the tuna sashimi and the pork belly, melt in your mouth goodness. Also the dessert was delicious, extremely good chocolate soufflé.
Jenny G.}Manhattan, NY}5}60}0}-1}4}12/15/2013}Let's start from the beginning. It was quite an adventure to find the restaurant. Had the address, went into the 2 neighboring Japanese restaurants and asked for directions. Then stumbled upon a skinny door with no sign or any indication that there is a restaurant downstairs. Went inside cautiously. Walked down a hallway then turned and turned again. Then went down stairs. Finally found the restaurant. It is quite tricky to find. Almost like they don't want you to find them. The secretness is kind of nice too since it makes it an adventure just to get to the restaurant, which can be fun after the initial scariness/shadiness subsides. The atmosphere is nice. Feels almost like a traditional Japanese outdoor setting with wooden booth type seats and bamboo dividers. The servers were really friendly. Service was great. Food itself though, not that great. Several of the dishes we ordered used a similar sauce that was too sweet for me or saltier than I would've liked. Nothing was bland, but the taste was a bit too much, more than necessary for me. The texture was good. If they eased back on the seasoning, this place would get 5 stars. Overall, great service, nice decor, good but too sweet/salty food.
Vikki K.}San Francisco, CA}115}201}84}-1}5}12/15/2013}Our reservations were on a Friday evening at 6:30 pm but they were accommodating and allowed us to push it back to 8 since we had Grimaldi's around 5pm. We had a fairly large party of 10 and sat in the back of the restaurant. Since they are currently under construction, it was a bit hard to find since you have to enter the lobby and then head downstairs to find the entrance. We probably ordered over 20 plates of food but since the party was large, I only had the dishes at our side of the table. We had the assorted sashimi, the crab clay pot rice (this takes a while to make so be sure to order this first), tuna tartare, tamago squares with meat inside, pork belly, and wagyu beef that they cook in front of you with butter. My favorite dishes would have to be the tuna tartare and the wagyu beef. The wagyu literally melted in your mouth and smelled sooo good since it was cooked on the table. Since we had about 20 dishes and sake, it was $70 per person after taxes and tip. I will definitely be returning here the next time I visit!
Edison C.}Brookline, MA}0}6}1}-1}3}12/14/2013}Waiting so long even though the food is not bad. To be honest, as for the same price, I don't really recommend u this restaurant
George Y.}Los Angeles, CA}58}59}6}-1}5}12/14/2013}Truly outstanding. I loved my meal of seaweed salad ---- large portion of 5 different kinds, this is not your ordinary seaweed --- and sashimi. also had some fried pork belly which was outstanding. Found the place using Yelp as I needed a late night bit to eat near Grand Central. The place is indeed hard to find and don't get discouraged when you walk into a building that is under construction, through a beat-up lobby and then down three flights of stairs to the restaurant. It is worth the journey. Service was a bit stiff but the food and atmosphere were amazing
Eric C.}San Francisco, CA}8}343}1}-1}4}12/11/2013}Good place near westin grand central.  Hidden away in a basement.  Just another fantastic Japanese restaurant in midtown.
Ching C.}New York, NY}3}16}0}-1}5}12/4/2013}I tried several Japanese restaurants In New York City.  This place sticks out.  Absolutely a must visit location.  Growing up with chefs and food critics always makes me seek out outstanding foods.  This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem in New York.  It's underground location had me wondering....but once I reached the restaurant, I was awed.The service and food is awesome here.  I tried a cold Uni Soba dish that had Uni both in it.  The soba noodles were very different from the typical store bought soba noodles (made in house).  Texture is not slimy or rough, rather the texture of the soba noodles here had a slight chewy texture and was just overall yummy!!!The broth and toppings paired well together and flavors were very balanced/well paired and uniquely distinguishable.  The items on the menu at this restaurant are truly unique and the restaurant definitely spends money to create it's foods.  The ingredients used are quality products that have very distinguishable taste.  Even the rice used is a higher end product.  (Restaurants rarely spend money on rice because they throw away so much.)For dessert, I had their black sesame creme brûlée which was absolutely amazing and unique.  All melt in your mouth goodness.    The servers are really nice and will recommend items that they think are good and are very knowledgeable.  I had to ask them what they like because everything on the menu looked so good.After trying a few dishes here, I will absolutely be coming back for more.
Andy R.}Sudbury, MA}0}39}36}-1}4}12/4/2013}Awesome hidden place with great sushi. The whole experience is terrific from the time you walk in you're transported to a different world. Literally in the basement of the 211 building the restaurant is impeccably designed and has a terrific atmosphere. The food is excellent, I had the Maguro Tartar on the "cold side" and the Tori Karaage (fried chicken) on the "hot side" I didn't love the chicken but it didn't take away from the overall meal because the Tuna was out of this world good. When I go back I'll stick with fish and sushi. The Sake list is impressive and intimidating all at once. I love Sake but don't know much about all the different varieties. I told the waiter "cold and cloudy" and he was able to guide me to two different varieties that were terrific. The cost is very reasonable for all the food. Go for the food and sake but  this is also a great place to take a date or out of town friends who want to see a unique NYC resturant with a "cool factor" can't wait to go back
Laura H.}Stamford, CT}0}6}0}-1}5}12/3/2013}I want to preface this with the fact that I studied in Japan for about 6 months. I went here with my boyfriend and mother a couple weeks ago, and have returned a second time. It's partially hidden by a building entrance that was under construction, so when we entered for the first time, we were quite confused, then pleasantly surprised. I felt like I was back in Japan at that restaurant. The prices were not as $$$ as predicted (except perhaps for the high end Sake). It has a wonderful atmosphere and they give you green tea with your meal. They have reconstructed the inside of the restaurant to give you the feeling as if you are eating in an outdoor restaurant in Japan. We ended up spending 44$ for three people, and left full, which in my opinion is cheap for good food near Grand Central. It is as authentic a place as I've found, and I plan to return whenever I'm feeling particularly nostalgic. This place has a fancier feeling though, so I'd recommend looking a little nicer than usual.
Kristofer E.}Menlo Park, CA}113}205}379}18}5}12/1/2013}I have been here many times and thoroughly enjoy every time. Some dishes are hit or miss on certain days. My go to dishes are the pork belly which has a delicious broth and the fluke which is done in a yuzu sauce raw. The other dishes I had that night were not great.Dinner:-Pork Belly (excellent)-Fluke (excellent)-Egg with eel (not great)-Crab rice (ok)-Rice ball (not great)
Gregory C.}Brussels, Belgium}41}116}46}-1}4}11/30/2013}Currently a bit of an adventure trying to find the restaurant as the main entrance is being renovated, so you'll be heading through the back door on 44th to get in.Once inside and downstairs, the restaurant is quite big with a long seated bar section. The place is sufficiently popular for dinner that you may be in for a reasonably long wait, anything from an hour to two without a reservation.The food here is really good value for money. The quality of the produce is excellent and they have a series of accompanying sake that are well worth tasting.We had a bunch of fried things, including chicken, pork and shrimp balls wrapped in almonds. All were delightful but what really stole the show was the house speciality, a piece of pork belly in a wonderfully tasty broth. An absolute delight. Since you do need some vegetable, the eggplant is a must. Cooked perfectly, it comes in three two bite portions, each coated with in a different seasoning, a pleasure for anyone who likes eggplant.My partner who'd been once before also recommends the beef tongue stew. I was simply too full to try, which also meant missing out on what looked like rather lovely desserts.Lunch boxes are also available and apparently well worth it.
Melissa M.}New York, NY}39}185}31}-1}5}11/27/2013}One of the few restaurants I regularly visit, and I have yet to have a bad experience (knock on wood).  Their dishes are made with lots of attention to detail, using the finest quality, freshest ingredients.  I can't even single anything out as I've loved everything I've gotten so far here (and I've tried most of the dinner menu).  Their lunch options are a bit more limited but are quite reasonably priced (I have not made it here early enough yet to take advantage of the lightning lunch special deals ... maybe one of these days).The fact that this place is tucked away in the basement of a nondescript commercial building makes it extra fun.
Julian H.}Northern San Diego, CA}0}8}0}-1}5}11/25/2013}This is some of the absolute best Japanese food I've tried. The sashimi is extremely fresh and the Sake menu is amazing.
David L.}New York, NY}4}80}0}-1}3}11/15/2013}The sake selection is extensive, and they have a good range of prices.  The sashmi was well presented with a tasty sauce on the side.  Had a interesting fish roe dish, but I found it a bit too salty.   The best for was the Chawanmushi (egg custard).  We selected two main dishes, the washu beef, and the crab with rice.  The beef comes out on a hot grill so you can cook it.  The cut was on the lean side, which tasted like a low grade cut.  The crab was not very flavorful, which I think is a general issue with certain types of crab.  More hype than flavor, so I think that was a bad choice.   Overall, not that impressed.  Partly from bad choices, and partly let down from high expectations.   It took weeks to get the reservation, and the reviews are all positive.
Dawn L.}Brooklyn, NY}263}136}6}-1}5}11/11/2013}This place was perfect.  The food was authentic and affordable.  Tasted really good!The waitress behind the bar was really sweet.  She answered my questions and explained what I didn't know.  Nice place to go for after work or even a date.
Fiona C.}New York, NY}34}372}22}18}4}11/11/2013}Came here for date night and was blown away with the service and food. We ordered the lightly seared washu beef (delicious..and that's a lot coming from a non-meat eater like me), tuna sashimi with mountain yam (not impressed with the tuna cubes, mountain yam slimehh as expected), and the uni soba (omg soo soo good. Uni is fresh , practically dissolved on ny tongue on contact. The broth is with freshly uni flavor and milky deliciousness). The uni soba won me over..or so I thought. And the dessert just sent me to heaven. We got the pear dessert (earl grey ice cream is really good, biscuit super flaky, cream was so good) and the black sesame creme brulee (mmmmmmm soo amazingly bold in black sesame flavor, a definite winner). Service was attentive.
Dave F.}Hoboken, NJ}391}573}1259}18}3}11/10/2013}When you enter this commercial building and go down the stairs to a cavernous lair with large casks of sake all over, you do feel transported to a restaurant in Japan. Unfortunately, that's kinda where the fairy tale dinner experience ends. Service was prompt, and the sake list impressive (even more so if you have someone fluent in both Japanese and good sake with you at dinner). I was here with a group of about ten people, and we got a whole mess of stuff. Apologies in advance, but I'm just going to go with English names of dishes to make al of our lives easier. Salad with tofu - the tofu was creamy and mild, and the salad overall light. Good starter. Edamame - do I really need to go into detail here?Tuna with two types of caviar - pretty tasty, but at the same time, nothing too crazy. Pork meatballs - dry and bland. Skip this one. Grilled tile fish - this was pretty tasty. Caramelized skin with a good combination of chew and crunch, and a flavor and texture very similar to seabass. Definitely worth giving a go. Grilled eggplant with bonito - nicely cooked eggplant with super briney bonito flakes. It's ok. Stewed diced pork - this alone is worth coming for. You get. Giant chunk of pork stewed in a magical broth made by god himself. The pork falls apart an the fat is rendered into a smooth deliciousness. The broth was just plain ridiculous. I drank it from the 6 different bowls on the table. Amazing dish. Deep fried chicken - not really anything more to see here. It was deep fried chunks of dark meat chicken. Good, but nothing all that interesting. Shrimp balls rolled in almonds - little shrimp flavored spongey balls with a slice almond crust. Interesting for sure, but really just ok. Grilled chicken - again, the dish is exactly what it sounds like. Basically a teriyaki grilled chicken. Overall, it's a cool place with a cool vibe, and a great sake list, but at the end of the day, really only the stewed pork stood out to me. Most everything was good, but mostly forgettable.
Irina M.}New York, NY}8}147}0}-1}5}11/10/2013}Needed a quick lunch in the area and followed the high Yelp ratings. I really enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere. I had a lunch special consisting of cold soba with uni and found it to be very satisfying. I definitely look forward to coming back here and having a larger meal next time!
Kazemaru Y.}Honolulu, HI}74}22}118}-1}5}11/7/2013}Excellent place for good quality Japanese food in an authentic buzzy atmosphere. One of my new favorites on the map of good food. I am spoilt with great food living in Japan for 16 years + family of great chefs, yet I can guarantee this place will not disappoint (Note; I am not easy to please). For vegetarians it is additionally hard to find restaurants that knows the huge variety vegetarian really can be. This place knows the art well.The service was efficient, attentive and respectful... I love the interior design as well. Japanese and New York City combined at its best. Lunch was very busy, yet we didn't have to wait long for our food. I Definitely suggest a visit for a really good bite. Don't miss the green tea ice cream!!! It is a classic. It seems they have a great sake collection too. Can't wait to return.
Phil B.}Brooklyn, NY}1}30}0}-1}5}11/6/2013}For some reason, Midtown East is full of Japanese restaurants. I've been to a lot of them, but this is the best. It has all of the trappings of a secret place. They're located in the basement and not particularly well-marked. Their lunch special is limited to the first 30 people to order it or something like that. Once inside, chances are your phone won't work. The atmosphere is cozy, though, and the food is really excellent.
Danielle B.}Chicago, IL}2}16}2}-1}3}11/6/2013}Not sure why this place has over 4 starts. It was a let down. We ordered 10 dishes of which we really liked 2 - the tuna tartar and the chilled duck. The grilled eel sounds like it would have been a good choice. Don't bother with dessert. They have a great sake selection. Note: do not order the ginger sauce fried chicken or the fluke carpaccio (not very fresh).
Matt R.}ASTORIA, NY}78}39}5}-1}5}11/5/2013}I struggled with the idea of even reviewing this meal, simply because I don't know if I can give Sakagura any praise that it has not already received by other reviewers. I suppose only as a testament to the consistency of the quality, service, and atmosphere, but as 800 people have written before me, you don't need to read on, just go, trust, and enjoy the experience yourself.There is something thrilling and exciting about having to discover a place even when you know exactly where it is, but it's exactly that experience that Sakagura, hidden away three floors deep in the bowels of what appears to be a series of office spaces or possibly apartments currently under construction, gives you. An experience that starts well before the meal. The almost awkward "should I even be here" feeling.Thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer, I was able to get an 8:45 reservation on a Friday night only a few hours before, after OpenTable said there was nothing available within 3 hours of my requested time, by calling and speaking to the host.Once you pass through the piles of plywood, roped off pipes and construction lifts, a man at the front desk of the building's lobby will guide you to a staircase. Descend down the narrow stairs into the basement, and at each level of depth you get a little further out of Manhattan, and into Japan. First flight a poster for the restaurant, next flight some bamboo screens, and by the time you walk through the door, you are transported to a small dockside Japanese village, filled with little huts with booths in them, oriental shrubs, and a low lit, warm, and ever so inviting atmosphere. We took our table for two in the bar section, and knowing this place is famous for their extensive sake menu, and even after living in Japan for nearly 2 years, knowing I know nothing about sake, I followed the lead of many other Yelpers and asked our waiter for a recommendation. We went thru the menu, found a description that sounded right for our taste, and decided to order. I was a little hesitant, as the bottle we chose was listed at $75 - but my hesitation was quickly washed away with a security in knowing I was about to experience, according to the opinion of the masses, one of the best meals available in New York. Besides, everything else on the menu is small plates, most ranging between $7-12, rarely anything over $20. Hopefully in the end the price would work itself out.The Sake arrived in a beautiful bottle adorned with flowers and in a bamboo tub of ice. Our waiter poured it and on first taste, it was hands down the best Sake I have ever had. My date for the evening, with the exception of one or two required "must try's" said she trusted me and allowed me to order.The first dish that arrived was the Gomaae, spinach in a sesame sauce topped with peanuts. A simple and elegant combination that I would have never thought to put together, but from this experience, will most likely revisit in my home cooking. This was followed immediately by the red miso soup. Usually partaking in a clear miso, the color alone added a sort of new dimension to the familiar warm, salty taste. The Yuba shumai, three little pillows of pork and shrimp dumplings in a citrus sauce and the Gindara yuan yaki, grilled cod in a sweet soy sauce arrived next, both a delight. These dishes were followed by the Hirame ponzu, a surprisingly robust and refreshing citric fluke sashami, and the highly reviewed Surumeika yaki, the bbq grilled squid dish, both which were delicious. At this point in the evening, my date fell victim to the old dropped chopstick, and when I said "excuse me" to a passing waiter, instantly 3 additional waiters stopped at our table. Quite the response.When the squid was finished the nightly special arrived, a thinly sliced beef tataki brushed with a citrus sauce and topped with ponzu. This, was followed by an order each of the Buta kakuni, hands down the single best pork belly dish I have ever experienced. The sweetest, juiciest, bursting with flavor, square cut of pig I have ever put in my mouth. This is the kind of dish that you have seen Anthony Bourdain time and time again, declare as the best thing on the face of the Earth. If you are going to do one thing when you are at Sakagura, get the pork belly. The pork belly was suppose to be the last course, however, over the course of the last hour, of which I should mention, the dishes were impeccably timed, never more than two plates on the table at once, I had noticed a regular occurrence. A fantastic smelling, and frequently ordered deep fried chicken dish, which I just had to try. So we ordered the Tori Karaage and were not disappointed.For dessert, Goma Brulee, a black sesame ice cream, and a fantastic close to the meal.Now the moment of truth, the check. Expecting well over $250 you can imagine my surprise when it rang in at $184- $75 of which was sake. A fantastic experience, but don't take my word. Go on the adventure yourself
Mea H.}San Francisco, CA}86}197}28}-1}4}10/31/2013}So this is one of those literally underground, hard-to-find, same-address-as-another-place restaurants that New York is so obnoxiously famous for. As my uncle said, "It HAS to be good to stay in business with a location like this." He's lived in New York for 30 years, but I guess this kind of thing still stands out to him.Anyway, hilarious location aside, this place IS good. Really, really good. I had a fairly simple dish: cold udon noodles in broth with mixed mushrooms. Still delicious. The noodles were perfectly chewy, the mushrooms indeed diverse, and the broth savory and pleasant when mixed with the sweet glaze from the mushrooms. My uncle had the Japanese eggplant in three kinds of miso (egg yolk, spinach, and red bean), plus the fluke carpaccio. I only tasted the eggplant with the spinach, and it was pretty tasty, but I would try the other two in a second. The fluke was fresh, light, and beautifully presented with a mint leaf, paper-thin lemon slices, and salmon roe. My uncle added hot pepper to it, but I wouldn't have altered it.We had a sake cocktail which was just okay. They only have two, one with peach and one with citrus-mint. I should have gone with my gut and had the citrus-mint, but I had the peach one which was simply too sweet. DESSERT THOUGH, was fabulous. The black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream was excellent. It reminded me of another favorite dessert, halvah, which I know is rather an unnecessary comparison. But, I love halvah, so it was great. My uncle had the seasonal pumpkin creme brulee which was really, really pumpkiny, if you're into that. Overall, this was the kind of dining experience I wanted. I love simple and delicious flavors, creative ingredients, and nice presentation. I'd try the hell out of the other cocktail and come with more people so I could try more stuff!
Kay K.}Leonia, NJ}87}34}46}-1}4}10/27/2013}Weekend dinner make sure to make reservations..there was nothing on opentable but friend made phone call and was able to get table for 4 at prime dinner time. So try calling if opentable says nada.I am terrible at remembering foreign dish names so I can't name a single thing I ate, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order.If you are into starchy carby comfort food, try the fried mashed potatoes. You dip in salt and oh my!! It is the ULTIMATe in chewy awesomness. Our waiter said they have the largest sake menu in the states. Unfortunately I am not much into anything alcoholic, just an fyi. The bill definitely adds up before you know it so be prepared to pay up if you are hungry.
Briget P.}East Bay, CA}1101}993}157}18}4}10/23/2013}Underground, authentic Japanese restaurant - I'm a fan! Their sashimi is very fresh, desserts are unique, and the overall quality of their dishes are impressive. Service is great too. I would recommend getting their lunch platter to share with a friend - plenty of variety eats with that option.
Angela L.}Montclair, NJ}51}88}79}-1}5}10/22/2013}I owe this wonderful place a review loong time. It's been one of my favorite lunch place for a while, not to mention in their dinner menu the Onsen Tamago ALWAYS blows my mind.A bit background I learned: Sakagura means factory/winary of rice alcohols while sake can be made from other food like potato as well....so its basement location makes sense to the name.Decor:  It's in the basement, the narrow stairs leads to the warm welcoming entrance where you may feel like being in Japan. very natural bamboo and wood furnitures, and the bar is full of different colorful bottles of sake. Yet they don't offer seperated table space like Abruiya does. Drinks:  Sakagura has a looong alcohol drinks list, including some are not sold publicly in United States. Different drinks are served with different glass/bottle carrying fresh flowers, adding more pleasure to enjoy.   Personally I only have plum wines because they are super sweet compared to sake, yet still quite strong as sake.  If you don't know what sake to try, the waiter/waitress will be very patient to offer you sample tastes. Food: Since it's a 'sake' place, the dishes are more like a 'companion' for sake instead of entrees. So their sizes could be even smaller than average Japanese restaurant.  The quality is superb though.  None of the courses I ordered is disappointing,  My all time favorite is Onsen Tamago in the dinner menu. But don't try it if you like egg thoroughly cooked. Grilled black cod is recommended too.Their lunch menu is truly value for money. The $30 tasting menu is totally worth the money, same quality probably half priced if not less. Last but not least, everything on the dessert menu is DELICIOUS...yes, I've tried them all...if I have to choose one to recommend, probably the chocolate sorbet with sea salt, and black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream.
Josh Q.}San Francisco, CA}33}414}0}-1}4}10/17/2013}The basement of a run-down office building is generally not conducive to a cozy restaurant setting, but this is exactly where Sakagura makes its living.  Given its unspectacular location, you won't see much touristy foot traffic here - anyone who comes here has either been here before or had it recommended from friends.  There is good reason - every dish is finely made with high attention to detail - nothing is too sweet or salty, too soft or hard, too hot or cold.  I eat out quite a bit, and there were even a few plates here that I have never seen elsewhere.  +1 in my book for originality!
Graham K.}Idaho Springs, CO}24}292}67}18}5}10/16/2013}Wow. A great find thanks to Yelp. We had a lot of different items - the Washu Gyu Tataki was the favorite at the table - it had an ouitstanding and unique flavor that will bring me back here for more. I also really loved the Maguro Tartare - i think i could eat that every day for the rest of my life. The Goma Brulee for desert was also outstanding. Really great service - no wine or scotch but the very patient waitress lead us through the sake choices and what we might like based on our taste. It worked out really well, but next time i'll probably just have a beer. Highly recommended.
Yo J.}Rego Park, Queens, NY}165}56}23}-1}5}10/14/2013}Hands down best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to besides morimoto and Sagami. Sashimi is unbelievably fresh light and at its top quality!! It can be pricey but it's worth it portions are really small which I like. I suggest that you order the more authentic dishes don't order the fried chicken and the fried chicken balls not worth it stick to the duck and sashimi!!  It's so good :) even the fluke carpaccio was great as well! Service is a 5/5! Our servers were humble attentive and had great suggestions ! Their dessert menu you can't go wrong with  I almost tried all of them and they are made at its best and not just plain sugary. The quality of their seafood is like a five star restaurant! :) love this place and will definitely come back :)
Jessica W.}Boston, MA}193}126}7}-1}4}10/1/2013}Very authentic Japanese small dishes! I loved the ambiance. There is a quieter area and a more roudy area. The bar is also very cute! Would bring people here for an authentic Japanese small dish experience!
Stephanie H.}Manhattan, NY}1}19}0}-1}4}9/29/2013}I've enjoyed all my meals here. It's the quintessential Japanese delicate home cooked cuisine that's not your typical tonkatsu and tempura fare. You'll find beautiful dishes like the salmon in broth and rice, delicious eggplant dish with 3 types of miso, soup with uni and the most amazing part is that their desserts are just as good! Must try for sweets are the sesame crepe brûlée and the chocolate soufflé, I would go back just for dessert. Great, reliable and always fresh, this place is a great Japanese neighborhood joint.
Vittoria M.}Porta Romana, Milan, Italy}3}13}6}-1}5}9/28/2013}The decor is great, it makes you feel like you are actually in Japan! The menu is different from the Japanese restaurants I had been to before, so we had a bit of a hard time ordering, you should ask or look around at what looks good!The duck is amazing! There is an incredible choice of sakes
Sylvia C.}Quincy, MA}181}388}1481}18}4}9/24/2013}One would never find this restaurant easily - they're located in the basement of an office building.  Almost decided not to try the restaurant because they didn't offer sushi. Given the # of positive reviews - we made a last minute reservation for 9:30pm(only available seating is at the bar).There was a wait when we arrived for our dinner reservations.  The restaurant décor -  pretty chic and modern with japanese decorations.  The host brought us to our seats at the bar.  The bar was lined up with bottles and bottles of saki - all different sizes and names.  I was scanning the bar for wines/vodka but no such luck (confirmed when I looked inside the drink menu).  Opted for tea instead.  The bartender/server greeted us immediately and offered us hot towels to clean our hands.  There were tons of items to choose from in the menu - all within reasonable price ranges ($6-$15).  As other reviewers had suggested - ordering several dishes to share - like small plates/tapas.  We ordered the following:1. Sake infused fried chicken2. Almond coated fried shrimp balls3. Tuna tartare topped with 2 kinds of fish roes4. Grilled squid5. Salmon and fish roe rice balls6. Beef tongue Dessert:Black sesame creme bruleeAll the dishes including dessert were fantastic in its own way...all uniquely seasoned giving our palettes a whirlwind.  Given the ambiance, service and quality of food - this place is highly recommended.
Diana C.}ASTORIA, NY}7}12}0}-1}4}9/20/2013}I've only came here for lunch during the weekdays and it gets crowded. Be prepared to wait for 5-10 mins anytime during lunch hour on weekdays (unless you're lucky). I like it that it's hidden in an office building, down the stairs and at the basement. It makes it almost exclusive - until you see the large crowd eating. The ambiance and decor resembles much like a Japanese izakaya which brings memories of Japan back to me. There is also bar seating. So, for lone diners, you can come here. Service - Since lunch is always busy, there is definitely a wait for your food to arrive. It's not a place if you want to get a hurried lunch. Their service is good, nothing lacking but also nothing overwhelming. Our waiter had forgotten our appetizer the last time - but it was forgiven as it was loud in the restaurant and he misheard us. They bring hot towels at the beginning and at the end of the meal. Food - I've always ordered their half donburi (rice bowl) and hot/cold soba. Always yummy. Always hits the spot.
Nikki A.}New York, NY}268}473}28}18}4}9/17/2013}In the past I've found myself rounding down stars, but lately I seem to be rounding up.I came here for dinner last night with a friend. As previously noted, this restaurant is located in the basement of a building. Just follow the signs down.What we got:GOMAAE :  Lightly Boiled Spinach Flavored with a Grated Sesame Sauce $5.00KAMO ROAST :  Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce  $10.00 BUTA KAKUNI :  SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork  $6.00 (Per piece, got one)GINDARA YUAN YAKI :  Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce  $10.00 SAKE OYAKO DON :  Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Steeped in Soy Sauce Served Atop a bowl ofRice [Served with Miso Soup]  $16.00The gomaee was tasty, albeit nothing special. The duck was yummy--it actually didn't really taste like duck, more beefy, but I enjoyed its flavor and  basil sauce a lot. The pork broth was really delish, the pork itself was good, but fatty. The cod was flaky and buttery, just how I like it and the salmon was fresh and amazing.Service was slightly pushy, but attentive. I was very content after the meal, but still couldn't say no to some 16 Handles. :)The bathrooms are pretty cool. I would come back again, but I'm in no rush.
Sophie L.}Durham, NC}16}12}7}-1}5}9/3/2013}This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan! Try their Uni (sea urchin roe) soba & fried cod!
Concious S.}Manhattan, NY}0}10}0}-1}3}8/31/2013}The person took reservation was a little rude on the phone.  The service was okay when we got there.  The food is average.  maybe I have too high of expectation for the place.
Anthony T.}Bellevue, WA}0}3}0}-1}3}8/27/2013}After reading many reviews, my family and I were very excited to try out this place. Unfortunately, the food did not meet our expectations. We have tried many other Izakayas in the past and we all thought our past experiences were a lot better. Immediately after glancing the menu we all noticed that this Izakaya attempts to deliver authentic Japanese food. My family and I coming from Japan were very excited to try out the food because we were looking for Izakayas that provided the traditional taste. However, the food was mostly tasteless or bland. We all also agreed that the service was very slow. At a Izakaya, we all thought that the food should be coming at a constant pace which is very normal in Japan. This is so you and family or friends can enjoy drinking at the same time with the foods pace. They all spoke Japanese to us with proper service but we wondered since most staff members are Japanese, how might their service be when serving American customers?We understood what they were trying to deliver but thought they could work on more than a few things to make things better.Just to put it out there, for people that have a keen sense of tongue for Japanese food, I would not recommend this place for the listed prices.
Cherise K.}Manhattan, NY}1}28}0}-1}5}8/26/2013}Do I really need to add to the hundreds upon hundreds of insanely positive reviews for this bomb establishment? Yes, yes I do... because that's what true love does... And Sakagura, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1. It's in a basement. For all you 'secret' restaurant/bar lovers out there, this hits a point on your checklist. The ambiance is cozy and delightful. The bathrooms are also modeled after sake barrels -- take that for originality! 2. The service is a-one. The staff does its best to make sure your dining experience is relaxed and enjoyable. None of the waiters are harried or uptight, rather they will take the time to guide you through the menu and make sure that all your needs are met. 3. The food... is...out...of...this....world. I've been here for lunch and dinner and am constantly amazed at the vast assortment of deliciously prepared food.  For lunch their lunch tasting menu is a fantastic way to explore a variety of items on the menu for just $30 (and it's plenty of food to share with another person). For dinner, a few of the small plates I adore are: hiyayakko, the homemade chilled tofu is velvety and unlike any tofu I've ever had. (No more store bought for me!) The egg custard (chawanmushi) had a vinegary kick from the ponzu sauce that worked beautifully. The main dish of salmon sashimi (sake oyako don) with salmon roe is sublime -- the freshest of the fresh. Also the tuna sashimi with mountain yam (maguro yamakake) is delectable. Although it's not 'authentic', their chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream should not be missed! 4. The price is right. Two small plates + a main dish (sufficient for a meal) comes to between $30-$35. The $30 lunch tasting menu, which can easily be shared by two, is also quite affordable. For heaven's sake, need I say more?
Ben L.}Queens, NY}943}947}2632}18}4}8/24/2013}Easily one of the most fun restaurant experiences and one of the best ambiances. I like the fact that most of the staff is Japanese, I feel it adds to the experience. I really feel that this is a transporting type of restaurant since it feels very Tokyo. I also love the insider factor when it seems like you are in the know when you have to go to a basement of an office building to get in. First thing you see when you get downstairs are the containers of sake and then the inside setup is mostly wood and bamboo. Sake is a big part of the menu and the experience which explains why it is displayed on the wall by the bar. The style of food is Japanese izakaya kinda like Japanese tapas. The food:Agedashi Tofu- This is a dish for it's subtle flavors. It's lightly fried soft tofu on top of a soy broth. The batter is barely there, but it adds a slight element of texture with a very soft crunch. The tofu is very neutral in flavor but picks up flavor from the soy broth. It's a nice homey dish.Homemade Nihachi Soba- these are cold buck wheat noodles with a soy dipping sauce with wasabi and green onion. This dish is not ment to blow you away with robust flavors, it's a dish for it's subtle nuances. It's a dish about the subtle sweetness from the soy and the right chew with the noodle accented with a little kick from the wasabi and a herbal note from the green onion. It's also OK to slurp lolButa Kakuni- slow braised pork belly in soy with mustard. The pork is a fork tender, unctuous piece of meat, it's on the fatty side so this is not something you eat by yourself. The hot mustard helps cut the fat since you will need it. I thought the texture of the meat was a little on the dry side though.Black Sesame Creme Brulee-  visually, it's a very cool looking dessert. The taste was nice, but it felt like it was missing something. The tuile on top was OK, but the ice cream and creme brulee were nice.
Angie L.}Manhattan, NY}3}14}50}-1}5}8/23/2013}I came here for the birthday dinner with my friends and we were able to sample a large number of plates. Just be aware if you make reservations for a big group, they require that you order a minimum of $50 per person. Some of the dishes that I recommend are Ebi Shinjo (fried shrimp ball covered with almonds), Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly, one piece is quite bit and can shared among 2-3 people), Gyutan Yawaraka (Beef tongue...this is really good! Better than the pork belly. Best to eat with rice and use that sauce the beef tongue was cooked it!), Daikon Salad (very light dish. It's very simple but it's actually tasty), Black Sesame Creme Brulee (I dont think I have seen this in other restaurants) and Black Sesame ice cream. The sushi here are also very fresh and good.One of my friend had the cold soba which I thought was only okay. I guess I like to eat my noodles hot. The Ongiri rice balls aren't that special either. The food came at a really slow rate. Sometimes it felt like I was waiting forever for the next course. It might be because they wanted us to order more sake since they make more money on that. The restaurant is location in the basement of an office building, so just be aware of that when you are looking for it.
Danny S.}Brooklyn, NY}74}54}11}-1}5}8/23/2013}One of the best japanese restaurants in town!Even better because it's so hidden (you need to go inside an office building then go down to the basement)The food is amazing (and pretty) and the service is great.The only down side is the food takes quite a bit and often times there's a wait to get a table because they're so popular.
Jeong L.}Rockville, MD}223}172}878}18}4}8/17/2013}Sakagura is one of those restaurants that we always would want to visit when we take a trip to NYC.  It is pricey (depending on how many small dishes you order, it can easily go up to $80-$100 per head), but the menu is extensive and you can order something unique and special that you can't get anywhere else.  Despite how much I like this place, I am giving it a 4 star because there are some bizarre items on the menu that one should never order in my opinion.  One example would be onsen tamago.  Basically, it's almost raw egg yolk chilling inside some broth (Onsen means spa in Japanese) with a piece of uni.  Especially because the broth was cold, the egg obviously wouldn't cook any more, and I guess you were supposed to drink the whole thing.  I know that some Japanese people love eating hot rice mixed with raw egg and soy sauce, but I am not a fan of raw egg, so I will pass on that.  It seems that some yelpers love this dish, so if you are adventurous, then definitely give it a try.  It's just not my thing.** Also, as a note, they had a special promotion on sake imported from FUKUSHIMA.  What.....  ?   My eyes widened when the waitress told us that with an innocent smile on her face.  I swear, I didn't know they still produced goods in Fukushima after the nuclear plant incident.  I mean, are you serious that the US government would allow these Fukushima products to be imported into the US market?  Hmmmm.  I am quite shocked that a high-end restaurant like Sakagura would order Fukushima goods.  Are they oblivious or are they doing this on purpose to show support for Fukushima?Here are some items that I would recommend:-Inaniwa udon:  The texture of the noodle is impecable.  I suggest you order the cold version and eat it like soba noodle.  (dipping sauce comes out separately)-cow tongue:  yup.  I know.  Not many people eat cow tongue, but it's a delicacy.  It tastes almost like... very well made galbijjim (Korean style short rib casserole).  It's very delicate and tender.  Don't think about the tongue when you eat it. -ebi shinjo- fried fish balls.  - black sesame creme brulee.  This is better than the one I had at Cha-An in East village.  Considering Cha-An is one of the highest rated dessert places in NY (700+ reviews, 4.5), it's impressive.  In sum, Sakagura is a place that's definitely worth giving it a try.   Also, because it's a very popular place, you need to make a reservation ahead of time.
Fiona P.}New York, NY}130}52}67}-1}3}8/16/2013}the restroom is super high tec lolThe food is not exceptionally impressive but definitely a good place to hang out with buddies drinking and ordering small dishes. My favorite is the Yellowtail appetizer and the beef steak appetizer.
Vic-Crys W.}New York, NY}11}74}58}-1}5}8/14/2013}Pros - very creative dishes and excellent price. Our group favorite were the pork belly, cow tongue, onsen tamago, and soy sauce ice cream. The pork belly was amazing and melted in your mouth. The cow tongue was a thick cut which we've never had before and it was perfectly marbled. The onsen tamago was three types of egg with Uni - sooo deliciousCons - food comes a bit slow, so expect a long dinner. We ordered about 9 dishes and ate for close to 4 hours.Comparable to soto, but Sakagura have more perfectly cooked courses.
Brian C.}Montville, NJ}84}16}9}-1}4}8/13/2013}The decor is really cool. I was pleasantly surprised considering I walked through a shady basement hallway to find this place. It feels like you're in Japan for a brief moment.Now onto the food! - The buta kakuni (pork belly) is really tender and the broth is very rich. Equal ratio of fat to meat. Highly recommended.- Onsen tamago has a soft boiled egg with uni and salmon roe in a base (broth?) that I would say is similar to a soba sauce taste-wise. I liked it but it really depends if you like fish/roe- Chawanmushi is an egg custard with a thickened Ponzu sauce. Served warm it's very rich and flavorful and the fun lies in digging around trying to find the shrimp and chicken (according to my friend)- Maguro tartar - it's a light dish of chopped tuna with roe in yuzu and caviar, no surprises here- Kamo roast - duck wrapped in scallion served cold; I wonder what it would have been like served hot; I did like the basil sauce though- Saikoro steak - the steak was tender and juicy and the onion sauce provides a nice balance of sweetness to the saltiness of the beef- Fluke carpaccio - very think pieces of fluke sashimi, very fresh, highly recommended as well- Chocolate souffle - not exactly Japanese but still excellent, loved the raspberry sauce (I'm just a big fan of raspberries in general)The service was pretty good as the servers checked in on my friends and me quite often to refill water and bring out the dishes. I was confused as to why all the dishes didn't come out at once. They were served in a random order. Perhaps it had to do with preparation or something.Either way, I recommend the place if you are a fan of Japanese food or just want to try something new. It's considered pretty authentic by most people.P.S. They have an extensive sake menu. We didn't want drinks so we didn't end up trying any but if you like sake you can always come here!
Jing W.}New York, NY}4}23}0}-1}3}8/11/2013}Food: should stick with raw fish. I ordered a $26 snow crab rice daily special, it was HORRIBLE. Bland, not much crab meat at all and the rice was soggy. The pork belly that everyone mentioned in the reviews was very very MEDIOCRE. The texture was a little dry. If you love pork belly try hakata tonton. Service: waitress was very nice but does not speak good English, she couldn't understand some simple questions after I repeated over and over again.Overall this is definitely not a 4.5 restaurant. I shouldn't trust yelp rating anymore....
Jeff S.}Barrington, IL}184}68}3}-1}2}8/7/2013}Our dinner reservation was made for 9pm on sunday night.  Upon arrival, we were asked to wait for a table for over 15 min.  The waiter dropped a menu and left us for at least another half hour.   I then ordered drinks for the table including a Kubota Manju sake ($18/glass).  The waiter suggested another sake that was equally as good and priced similarly.  When we got the bill, we were a bit shocked to see that they charged $50/2 very small pours of sake.  Wouldnt take his suggestions again.All in all, the food is good, and the service is slow.  But dont count on them giving you money saving suggestions when it comes to alcohol.
Amber K.}Manhattan, NY}87}121}8}-1}4}7/29/2013}Kind of like Japanese tapas. The duck is phenomenal! I thought it would be weird because it's chilled, but it's excellent. The pork belly and shredded beef were also really good, but all very sweet meats that got kind of repetitive since we ate them back to back. We were served the puffy sweet potatoes second when it should have been last since it's more dessert-y, like funnel cake. But all was really good.
John H.}Savannah, GA}23}191}32}18}4}7/27/2013}I loved the food.  Fresh sushi.One demerit for the hostess who seated people ahead of our party.  I should have said something when we were seated at the bar while people who arrived after us were seated at a table when we had reservations.  Considering the amount of money we spent, I would have hoped for more consideration.
Allison K.}Stamford, CT}38}88}2}-1}5}7/23/2013}This is one of the coolest places I've been to in NYC as of yet. Underneath an office building lies this beautiful restaurant. Japanese tapas, a huge sake menu. Everything was delicious. Highly recommend the coffee jello for dessert. I know, it sounds insane. But it's amazing.
Mark W.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}5}7/19/2013}Whether for business or pleasure - always a great place. We've tried most of the menu at some stage and loved almost every course. Well worth a visit.
Naijia H.}Manhattan, NY}20}90}0}-1}3}7/16/2013}Overpriced, pretentious and wholly unimpressive.  The sake list was extensive but of course the waiter's recommendation on a "moderate" sake was $400. Then when we selected something at 160, he told us it was "one of his favorite as well".The food was good - some of the best fish I've had in the city and very fresh tofu. The pork however, wasn't nearly as tender as I would have liked.  We got a selection of hot and cold appetizers but really there are better Izakayas in the city for a much more reasonable price and easier to get a table at, with better service.
Jeff B.}Detroit, MI}18}22}1}-1}4}7/15/2013}Just as others have mentioned, this place isn't blatantly obvious to locate, which makes it all the more alluring to find.As far as authentic Japanese food is concerned, this place is right on point.  The decor, while some may say "it's like stepping into Tokyo" is simply an Americanized rendition, but far from authentic.  Sure there's a Toto complete with automated/heated seat and trickle, but these are generally found in Japanese hotels, not restaurants.  However, they did have the infamous hot towel, which I personally find refreshing.  If your not familiar (and i could tell many at the restaurant were not) the hot towel is often given before a flight, train ride, or even a nice meal.  You use it to cleanse your face and hands.  Its generally mildly scented and it is very refreshing.On to the food, which again is authentic as you could get on American soil. I had the egg, tofu, beef and vegetables, pork belly,  and I washed it down with some standard sake, and a Sapporo draft.  The servings are similar to tapas, or Ala' cart.  Each item comes out as it is prepared, not all at once.  This gives you the opportunity to cleanse your pallet between dishes.The egg was prepared as a traditional Japanese omelette.  Layers of egg whipped with sake and rice vinegar carefully folded and prepared with hints of bacon or fish depending on the piece.  I preferred the bacon, as my pallet is more American than Japanese, but the fish was not to be missed either.  The tofu was tender, flavorful and fulfilling. It was like eating Japanese comfort food, as if i was eating mac and cheese, but far less heavy.  The beef and vegetables were a nice dish, nothing spectacular here but defiantly a good mix of gentle flavors and smells.  The star of the show (and last to arrive) was the pork belly.  Now, pork belly isn't for everyone.  Some may like it crispy, while others may enjoy it soft.  This was served thick cut with a hint of both.  It was melt in your mouth goodness.  Imagine eating the best thick cut bacon, but not having to chew on it like a brick of fat, but it falling apart like a rib that was just cooked for 8 hours.  I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys something special!The next time I'm in NYC I will make sure to stop in here and try some other dishes, there is defiantly something for every pallet here.
A W.}San Jose, CA}44}208}1078}-1}4}7/15/2013}The restaurant is located at a basement and could be small. Came here twice. First time was too crowded, so I left. The second time I had a reservation and it was empty when I got there. My companion and I both ordered lunch specials. I had oyako don and hot soba and miso soup. The oyako don was the best don buri I have ever had! The chicken pieces were a little too small and they were mixed with eggs and covered the rice. It looked beautiful and it tasted wonderful. The soba however, was a so-so and plain. Service was decent and the decor was nice.
Bianca W.}Maplewood, NJ}0}49}0}-1}3}7/13/2013}Let me preface my review by saying that the food was awesome. I think we may have gotten them at a bad time?We had to wait ages for a table - even though we could see plenty of empty ones.We had to wait ages for our food - even though we could see other tables getting theirs.There were only two toilets for what is a reasonably large restaurant.I haven't given up on trying this again at a non-peak time.
Koray Y.}Brooklyn, NY}0}9}0}-1}5}7/9/2013}This is one of the hidden gems of Manhattan.  Most intriguing Japanese food (no sushi here) and absolutely the best sake money can buy.  (Some of the sake bottles,   money may not be able to buy)  If you do not go with crazy expensive sake, this is a very reasonably priced place relative to the quality.  Very highly recommended, one of my most favorite places in Manhattan.
Lizi C.}Colorado Springs, CO}33}486}83}18}3}7/8/2013}In general I was very disappointed with my overall dining experience at Sakagura.  We didn't have reservations so we showed up around 6 pm on July 4th.  They told us there were no tables but we would be able to sit at the bar. The wait was about 10-15 minutes which sounded great for us.  Thus we waited and waited.  One couple in front of us, nobody was walking out.  I was starting to feel hungry and cranky and contemplate walking out, but then I'm stuck because we already invested about 25 minutes.  Finally, the hostess says our seats our ready. We walk through the curtains and there are 10 empty bar seats all this time.  Seriously?  Once seated at the bar, service was fine and the food came out quick.  We ordered hand made soba, udon, roasted pork with daikon, some sort of imported dried fish from Japan and the miso cod. The cod was delicious and the pork was delicious.  The soba was really unremarkable.  It didn't taste like buckwheat either.   The udon was also just really unremarkable.  Both dishes are horribly overpriced.  The dried fish from Japan tasted like salty jelly made of fish. (perhaps this was good by some standards that I'm am completely unaware of, but I did not care for it at all)No drinks and dinner came to about $85.  Not worth it. The ambiance is interesting. They've done a lot with the place considering it is in the basement and looks like it should be more of a laundry room than a Japanese restaurant.
Ann K.}Columbia, MD}60}341}660}18}4}7/3/2013}What a wonderful meal! Don't take anyone here on the first or second date. Why? Because your date will think you are abducting her/him. The entrance is so unpretentious, like going into the neon lit office building, then going down to the basement to a storage room. Once you open the restaurant door that is when the magic begins. Strongly recommended if you want to play a prank on your wife for anniversary or surprise birthday.Don't expect a sushi bar menu. It is not. It serves Japanese small dishes with sophisticated list of sake. In case you wonder what to order, here is the list of dishes my foodie friend ordered for us:1. ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup  $9.00 2. FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf  $10.003. SURUMEIKA YAKI :  Grilled Japanese Squid Brushed with Garlic Soy Sauce  $8.004. Pork Belly5. GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI :  Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms  $13.006. CHAWANMUSHI :  Steamed Egg Custard Served with Chicken, Shrimp and Gingko Nuts Topped with  a thickened Ponzu Sauce  $9.00 You must order sake. Make sure it is Junmai Daijinjo or better. The sake that we ordered is about $65 per bottle. That will do. There is no need to hit $200 per bottle for now. The sake evolves as I eat. It stands up best pork belly and beef tongue dishes. After you finish the meal, take a little walk to Upstairs at Kimberly Hotel around 50th street. I promise it will be a wonderful date.
Kumiko M.}Ottawa, Canada}22}52}0}-1}5}7/2/2013}AMAZING....just amazing. I went to NYC for the weekend with my mom and it turned out to be a delicious trip! Sakagura was a great find. It's in the basement of an office building with no store front so you have to know what you're looking for. My mom is Japanese and very picky when we go for Japanese food and she was impressed. The dishes are really interesting and oh so tasty. Just to name a couple dishes....hiyayakko(tofu), ika (squid), yakionigiri (grilled rice ball), natto maguro (tuna sashimi with fermented soy bean). The coolest dish was the ishiyaki beef. The beef is cut very thin and is cooked in front of you on a scorching hot stone! How cool is that? I don't drink sake but they've got a lot of selection. Be ready to spend a lil money....although they seem to have lunch specials which are pretty reasonable.
P H.}Grand Prairie, TX}2104}1595}4321}-1}5}6/27/2013}Decor: 5/5-Located through the double glass door next to Soba Totto, walking through Sakagura felt like I was walking through a mini-underground city. So neat!-I love the Neorest technology and how each WC was in a "hut"Service: 5/5-Server was Tsubasa, overall she was very friendly -The food arrived fairly promptly and Tsubasa informed us of when the next dishes were next-Multiple CC's accepted-Food was split between four, total came to $21.52 including tip. Not bad!Food: 4.7/5-Buta Kakuni ($5) is fatty pork but I appreciated the cuts where there were equal portions of fat and meat. The meat was tender and easy to tear apart. -Onsen Tamago ($9) is another version of egg on egg on egg (Thanks Tiffany S!). Soft boiled egg with uni and salmon roe in a base that tastes like soba dipping sauce. -Maguro Natto ($8) is the fermented soybeans on top of salmon which were soft and tender. I tried my hardest to have an open mind but I can't get into Natto. -Maguro Tartar ($16) came as a tower of tuna topped with orange and black roe. Good soft texture and flavor. -Gyutan Yawaraka Ni ($13) was not expected. I'm use to thinly sliced gyutan but these were like beef stew cubes. -Sanma Onigiri ($10) was unique. The rice balls appeared like bamboo leaf sticky rice and came with shiitake mushroom. All that wrapped with a whole baked pike mackerel. Salty and a mouthful. -Roasted Salmon Ochazuke Rice Soup ($7) is served hot. The roasted salmon was cooked and seasoned just right. Each spoonful felt comforting.
Alexandra R.}Manhattan, NY}47}74}9}-1}4}6/27/2013}Okay! You really feel like you are in Japan, and are served by some very lovely, super careful waiters who treat their service as an art. They make good suggestions and even helped me find a sake that I actually enjoyed-- they have over 200 different varieties. The two times I've been though, I don't think I've ordered well :( I was with people who wanted different things than I did and we didn't end up with a good mix of dishes. It's sort of like Japanese tapas, so you need to all be in the mood to try various things. You can't very well go with a person who says they don't want fish or meat... It makes your options limited at Sakagura. Hence, the star reduction. I want to love the food, but because nothing I've tasted has really wowed me as of yet, I cannot give them an all out 5 star rating. I will be back, with adventurous eaters, and will give them another try-- even if it's just to try the sake.
Christina Z.}New York, NY}901}355}342}18}5}6/25/2013}Make a reservation!Seriously, this place is really good for japanese food. I'm not sure about the sake selection because I don't drink, but it did appear quite extensive.We ordered so many things it is hard to remember, but what really stood out to me is the sakagura special, "buta kakuni" - the meat was so tender, stewed to perfection. I also love love love the huge layer of fat on top (my favorite part). This definitely brought me back to how we made it at home. The other dishes were not as memorable.Dessert - got the black sesame creme brulee -- if you like sesame, order it. If not, don't.
Sally G.}Manhattan, NY}24}63}1}-1}4}6/12/2013}The perfect secluded hideout restaurant! Great environment, the waiters and waitresses were very nice, and the sushi was lovely. There was one special dish where they give you a tiny hot rock so you can roast your own steak cubes on it. Great place!
Kay M.}San Francisco, CA}0}24}1}-1}5}6/11/2013}Amazing- just be sure to plan ahead and get a reservation. You're not going to be able to just walk in after work. Great small plates for sharing, huge sake list. They have this amazing soba special with uni that is to die for (if you like urchin). The roast edamame still on the branches makes a really cool presentation but is a bit too salty (if that's even possible). Really fresh seafood and they know how to treat their red meat.
Helen D.}San Francisco, CA}29}175}56}-1}4}6/10/2013}4.5 stars! I really loved this place and will, without a doubt, be returning.Everyone says great things so I'm going to use this Yelp Review as a reminder for what I can't miss next time. So, future self, please get:- Fluke Carpaccio with Miso (so fresh)- Washu Beef (one of the specials - hopefully it's still there)- Beef Tongue (seriously tender)- Jaga Dango (donut outside, potato-paste inside - mashed potatoes, the consistency of red bean mocha)- Sake Oyake Don (salmon was great, roe was great - rice was just rice)- Chocolate Souffle with raspberry sauce (gooey and delicious)It's ok to skip:- Miso Yaki Onigiri (wasn't really crispy rice - this is better at Yakitori Totto (NYC) and Gochi (Mountain View))- Buckwheat noodle with soy dipping sauce (my friend loved this, but perhaps I just don't care for the cold noodles)- Pork Belly (super fatty, very tasty - just not as good as the beef tongue)Looking forward to my next visit!!
Lelia T.}Brooklyn, NY}92}107}191}-1}4}6/10/2013}Beautiful place with great food. Sakagura is hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for, but that's what yelp is for. I came here as a birthday celebration on a Thursday. When I went, it wasn't crowded, but it was early. Dinner service started at 6 pm and I got there at 6:15 so that's probably why. I assume this place gets very crowded because when my friend went the day after (on a Friday), he didn't have a reservation and he was actually turned away. So make your reservations and remember to be on time! Sakagura is located in the basement so it's unlikely you'll have phone service. This can be an advantage to some people because you won't have to play the phone stacking game. Decorations were beautifulllll. Romantic, clean, and made me feel like I was in Japan. I think it's actually nicer than a bunch of places in Japan.Our waiter was superb. He was friendly and prompt. When I asked for sake recommendations, he was knowledgeable about it and didn't try to push us to order more. I'm not a big fan of sake, but this one was pretty pleasant. I forgot what it was called, but he said it was the most popular sake. Food came quickly, but it wasn't rushed. The servers waited til we were finished before bringing the next courses and it was paced well. They fold your napkins when you're away from the table and refill your cups often. Regarding food, we ordered around ten dishes. The recommended portions for two people were 7-9 dishes, but of course I'm a fatass and wanted ten lolol. Also these had japanese names, which I completely forgot so I'm just gonna describe them. 1. Chilled tofu appetizer: mmmm very fresh and smooth. The block of tofu was fairly big and it was covered in bonito flakes. This was a great appetizer because it doesn't fill you up but gets you in the mood for more food. My boyfriend wasn't as big of  fan as I was, but he had nothing against it. 2. Seaweed salad: delicious as well. This dish came with four kinds of seaweeds neatly lined around the bowl. The dressing that came with it blended with the seaweed so well and it was set on the side so you could decide how much you wanted. 3. Tuna tartar: this was topped with tobiko and surrounded by cucumbers. Smooth and tasted like other tuna tartars that I've had before. My boyfriend was a fan of this one. 4. Fluke carpaccio: fresh pieces of fluke sashimi. This was too fresh and fishy for my boyfriend, but I was okay with it. Good, but not phenomenal. 5. Pork belly: we got two servings of this and I'm so glad we did because I would not have shared this dish. THIS WAS SO GOODDD. It came as a giant block with some kind of soup base. The soup was soo delicious that I ended up drinking most of it. I even ate my onigiri with it cause it was awesome. GET THIS. Also it's a lil fatty, but whatever, you deserve a break. This was our favorite dish. 6. Sake don: salmon over rice. Fresh pieces of salmon, but the rice was a lil hard and too plentiful for the amount of salmon. 7. Onigiri: this order comes with two rice balls so the toppings we chose were salmon and bonito flakes. This was basically just a side of white rice with minimal toppings. Unlike the onigiri i was thinking of, the toppings were not inside the rice ball, but just laid on top. 8. Soba: soba was okay. Small servings and the dipping sauce wasn't too unique. I would skip this unless you need more carbs (always the case with me)9. Black sesame creme brulee: yummy. I've had better, but it was smooth and tasteful  so that's what's important. I enjoyed Sakagura, but I think my expectations were too high and the food didn't wow me enough, except the pork belly. But one out of 9 dishes to love is a little less than what I expected,so hence the four stars. It's also pretty pricey as well. If you decide to drink, it will go over $100 easily. The dishes were $8-9 on average.Overall, It was a good experience and I'm definitely glad I went. You guys should try it at least once.
S L.}San Francisco, CA}119}164}0}-1}5}6/10/2013}Came here on a Sunday night with another friend. The place is small so it is extremely hard to get a reservation. I made this reservation probably 3 weeks in advance.The place is underground so it is a bit hard to find, but the food is absolutely yummy.We had their Washu Beef Tataki, their deep fried marinated chicken and their Sake Oyakodon. Everything was spectacular. For dessert, we had the pear dessert and it was unbelievable. It isn't too sweet, which I like, but it might not be for everyone.Their dishes are like tapas style, so definitely order to share with friends.
Max M.}Washington, DC}3}63}3}-1}5}6/7/2013}Went here on New Year's Eve 2012. Everything was really exceptional. They were booked for the night, but my girlfriend and I showed up just hoping to get seated at the bar for a quick dinner the moment they opened. They were able to accommodate us, which was nice. We started with the sashimi platter, which featured salmon, tuna, blue fin tuna, sea urchin, and maybe one other fish. We also got some steak you can cook on a hot stone on your own table, pork belly, duck, and a few other things. The sashimi was excellent. The pork belly comes in this sweet broth and was unbelievable and melts in your mouth. The chilled roasted duck is cooked perfectly and has a great flavor. The squid is pretty simple and was just okay. The steak is expensive for a small portion of thinly sliced meat that you sear yourself on a hot stone, which I wasn't too impressed by. All of that and two glasses of sake, including tax and tip came out to just under $200, but it was a real feast, and we definitely could have ordered two fewer courses. I think I'm forgetting a couple other courses, but I mentioned the most memorable and best ones.There were still a number of great sounding items on the menu we just didn't have room to try. We ordered everything at once and the bartender cut us off from ordering more food since he thought we already had ordered more than enough. We ended up being lucky he did that since we couldn't finish a couple of courses.
Steph M.}Manhattan, NY}295}118}0}-1}5}6/1/2013}One of my top japanese tapas restaurants in new york. I also love zenkichi - if you like sakagura, then you'll loove zenkichi. Some yummy stuff I remember from Sakagura:1. pork belly - melted in my mouth2. miso cod3. tuna tartare with caviarNext time i want to order...onsen tamagoblack sesame creme bruleechilled roasted duck
Audrey T.}Manhattan, NY}32}228}13}-1}3}5/29/2013}Sakagura is sort of a popular business lunch locale due its location in Midtown East. It may be difficult to find since it's accessible through an unmarked basement door. It is quite large though, and while they typically say a table won't be ready for another 15 minutes, they may usher you in after only 5 minutes.Prices are not cheap at all, but $20 for a bento box is reasonable. I ordered the sashimi bento which was pretty enjoyable. The sashimi were delicious, albeit quite small in portion. The bento comes with a variety of sides as well as a big plate of noodles of your choice. Note that you will have to ask for the waitress to pour your soy sauce immediately, since they will take it away from you.I also LOVE that the bento box comes with your choice of ice cream - so many lovely flavours! Since I'm usually in want of asian ice cream flavours, I seized the opportunity and tried their black sesame gelato. Yummers.
Christine C.}Manhattan, NY}22}82}0}-1}5}5/28/2013}The blind date was a disappointment, but on the flip side the guy introduced me to this very authentic sushi place which is going in the little black book as an A+ find. Non-descript basement location made it near impossible to find. Pass the curtains to the main dining area and enter a little Japan atmosphere. The service wasn't worth raving about, but the sushi was super duper fresh which was a very nice surprise. I wish I had more time to explore the menu, but the date was awkward and was better to end it early than let it drag on unnecessarily.  I will be back to explore it more in depth.*mountain potato/yam had the texture of boogers - ewww.... haha
Fat Panda X.}New York, NY}451}100}2}-1}3}5/27/2013}There aren't enough Japanese places in Manhattan to satisfy the current "sushi craze"with that said, i have to give it to these guys, they know what they are doing. the ingreidents taste fresh; without that strange fishy mercury smell. it's always busy, a sign of any great eatery. A+ on food, B- on service.
e c.}Manhattan, NY}19}63}26}-1}5}5/25/2013}Oh wow. Found Sakagura on Yelp after searching for Chawanmushi and made a last minute reservation - totally exceeded my expectations. The receptionist was accommodating and courteous when I kept changing my reservation, so that was a good start, but the food would bring me back anyway. I've been here maybe 4 times in the last few months and keep bringing new people here every time. Great for traditional fair away from sushi, and with the soft jazz and amber lighting and old Tokyo decor, it feels like I'm walking into a Cowboy Bebop episode every time I'm here.
Greta G.}New York, NY}16}35}5}-1}5}5/22/2013}I have been here three times now and each time the meal was excellent.  A little pricy, but absolutely delicious.  Some of my personal favorite dishes (just thinking about those is making my mouth water right now): - beef tongue.- fluke carpaccio- eel (uzaku)- cod in sweet soy sauceEach dish is fairly small and they are presented on the menu from lightest to heaviest.  One of the times I dined there, the waiter took out each dish individually, in the order on the menu, only after we finished the last one.  I kind of preferred that because it made the meal leisurely and gave us time to enjoy our sake (did I mention the enormous sake selection?).  But the other two times the dishes came somewhat randomly and simultaneously.  Not too big a deal.This is a place to take clients (who are adventurous in terms of food).  It would also make an excellent date night.  Highly, highly recommended.
Julie B.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}8}13}0}-1}5}5/22/2013}I love this place and go there anytime I'm in the mood for Japanese food other than sushi. The service is great and the food even greater. Everything here comes in small portions so you can try several dishes at once. I usually go there with friends and we all share what we're ordered. I would especially recommend the pork belly but everything I tried was delicious. They also have a great variety of sake for you to try. If you can, ask to be seated in one of the booth in the front room as the back room is a lot less impressive.
Randie L.}Houston, TX}163}87}196}-1}5}5/19/2013}This place was hard to find but made the experience more intriguing.  Even their restrooms were fun.  The food is spectacular, perfect harmony of skill, art, and taste.  I enjoyed the list of sake to choose from.  When I went, the place was packed.  The staff there worked as a team and made the busy night seem calm.  It is a must try and must return when you are in New York.
Stephanie Y.}New York, NY}848}1210}25}18}2}5/16/2013}I have to say, I was disappointed here on multiple levels.  It's good that this is a hideaway speakeasy esque joint in an office building and all (the decor was the best part- it's a huge space so you should be able to sit down without too much of a wait), but eh experience as I took a client here for lunch.   Maybe it was lunch and maybe it was just crazy, but both the service and food were lackluster. The service especially, for a Japanese place, sucked.  It took us almost an hour to get our food-the waiter didn't know if we'd gotten our deserts, yet etc. It was a mess.  We both ordered the lunch platter set- $20 each.  I got the sashimi set, my client the tempura set (other options are veggie and grilled fish, which in hindsight, I should have gotten). Even though they said my sashimi was just 3 pieces, man those pieces were little!  Not thick chunk at all..   It was a salmon, fluke, and tuna.   There were a lot of fresh side dishes though: marinated eggplant (this was good), hijaki salad, potato, and tofu (this was good). We both ordered hot soba- don't know why because I always get cold.  It was whatever.  The whole set was whatever AND they forgot about the bowl of rice (not that I needed the extra carbs but still). Anyway, my partner's set looked a bit better- it was identical except for the tempura, which was looked tasty and standard.  It was a shrimp, fish, and various veggie pieces. I must say, for the ok food and bad service, at least the portions were big.   Our waiter (who was mostly nowhere to be found) thought we had gotten the desert that comes with our platter-- ice cream/sorbet topped with a wafer cone.I got green tea, and the client got vanilla- was pretty standard.The slow ass service is what really got me, especially since I was on a client's time, I wasn't cool with that and wouldn't return.  The whole place just seemed so flustered.
Siutan L.}New York, NY}12}15}266}-1}4}5/14/2013}Interesting fancy japanese food! A little pricey but worth the money, I heard it's hard to make a reservation and there's a time limit for your stay. But at the end, me and my friends all left with a smile on our faces!! Very nice experience. Everything on the menu are good!!! Espeucially the deserts! Yum!!
Krista J.}Brooklyn, NY}707}1157}34}18}4}5/11/2013}This restaurant is quite hard to find...it is actually located through the lobby of a normal business building, down an unassuming staircase into the building's basement, and down a dark hallway...and then you find yourself in Japan. The sake bar is huge...I could see this as a fun place for some after work drinks.There are a number of tables, all marked off for a bit of privacy, which is very nice. The service is excellent, though not very fast. Plan on at least an hour and a half for lunch (without dessert). As a note, there is no sushi served at lunchtime, which is a bit of a bummer.
Alan K.}Monterey Park, CA}494}679}10}18}4}5/10/2013}Sakagura was actually the first dinner restaurant I went to on my first trip to New York. With so many reviews I expected to have a really delicious meal, but I wasn't too thrilled overall due to service.FOOD QUALITY:There's no doubt that the dishes they put out here are very good. Hirame Ponzu was probably my favorite dish of the night. You can't go wrong with sushi, daikon radish, and citrus vinaigrette. It's a very light dish with the fluke being the spotlight; surprisingly the daikon radish absorbs a lot of the citrus vinaigrette and really has a nice acidic flavor with just a small hint of sourness. The daikon radish adds in a subtle accent, but provides for a small crunch to contrast the softness of the fish. Put it all together in a bite, and you experience an array of flavors from the elements above.I tried other dishes, while I did not find them to be favorites or just as great I still thought they were well executed dishes of the same standard. SERVICE:Service was a little lacking here, in my opinion. Our waitress wasn't that very helpful nor was she took some time in getting our orders in, refilling waters, and getting our bill. She was hospital when she was around, but she seemed friendlier towards other tables who were more like regulars. ENVIRONMENT:I like the ambiance in here; it's darker and slightly quieter (depending on who's sitting next to you) with a modest amount of privacy. Overall, for an izakaya it's pretty good. It can get pretty pricey here, but I'd probably come back at least once so long as I have spare money to burn here.
Shani M.}New York, NY}115}106}0}-1}3}5/9/2013}This place is beautiful and the location is really cool - absolutely out of the way (in the basement of an office building) and you would NEVER know it was here unless you were specifically coming here.  Step behind the curtains and you're in a different world entirely!The food was good, however, we felt a bit lost ordering and with the menu in general.  When asking our waiter for assistance we really didn't feel like we got very far and I don't feel like I got the full experience of dining here.  We felt like we were inconveniencing our waiter by asking questions and ended up confused about what we ordered.  He was impatient and short with answers.  I do feel that if I knew more about Japanese culture, I would have had a better experience.  But if you're well versed on that topic, I'm sure you'd be in heaven here!  I'd be willing to give it another try if I came with somone who was already familiar with the menu.
Carolina M.}Montreal, Canada}207}119}141}-1}5}5/8/2013}amazing spot! food is yummy! love the bathrooms and ultra tech toilets like in a Japan!
Christine T.}San Francisco, CA}846}803}1042}-1}5}5/7/2013}This place was amazing!!! A true gem in midtown. It's hidden inside an office building in the basement. I loved the ambiance and that it was very authentic. Pricey but worth trying. We ordered so much food, and the sake selection is amazing.1. sashimi plate - very fresh!2. tuna tartare with caviar - a dying must3. pork belly - doesn't look like much but it was soooo good and flavorful4. cod - delicious5. uni soba - must get this!! 6. fried tofu - very good tofu and sauceforgot what else we ordered but I'm sure everything here is amazing.Had the best black sesame creme brulee ever! I've had one elsewhere but this by far takes the win. I would come back just for this dessert.
Sal P.}Baltimore, MD}14}167}24}-1}5}5/7/2013}I have to admit - I was skeptical.  Even with nearly a thousand loud Yelpers a-yelping...I thought, maybe this is all hype?  Well............I whole-heartedly agree with the rave reviews here!Authentic Japan ambiance (as someone who used to live there :} ) and excellent food.  We kind of went nuts since everything sounded amazing --1. Sashimi plate - YES.  Super fresh and beautiful.  Excellent cuts, much larger than what I'm used to in American Japanese restaurant offerings.2. Grilled Octopus - WOW - fantastic flavor, perfect texture.3. Duck appetizer...Even the onigiri (rice balls), the miso soup (very rich), and the beef tongue (not my favorite texture, but WOW did they do a great job with it) were impressive!Overall, I'd say this is worth the splurge!  Lovely!
Melli B.}Pembroke Pines, FL}129}287}459}-1}3}5/4/2013}I must say, I was simply looking for Sushi when I yelped this place up near my hotel. It was within walking distance and had great reviews so me and my Russian friend decided to give it a try. I noticed Soba on the menu and since it was quite cold that night, I decided to get the soba instead since there wasn't any (what I know as) traditional sushi on the menu. I also ordered a tuna tartare. Well the tartare was okay. Pretty fresh but a very small portion. The presentation was gorgeous...so much so that it took me a minute to actually pull it apart with my chopsticks! The tuna was very fresh. The Soba noodles took a lot longer to come out and in fact, I think the gentleman forgot to put the order in because everyone around me who had arrived after us, had already gotten their soba. I asked him and he said, it will be right out, but then I noticed a bit of panic in his face as he rushed back to the kitchen. He returned with all the fixings that are used for seasoning the soba at the table and then about ten minutes later, after my dining mate was already completely done with her meal, my soba arrived. Aside from it being so late to the table, it was worth waiting for. The broth was delicious. I love to add a few drops of sesame oil to my soba and that took it over the top. The soba was very tasty and worth the wait.
Andrea H.}New York, NY}1}5}1}-1}5}4/30/2013}Authentic Japanese food. AMAZING! BEST japanese food I have tasted in NYC!The fatty tuna sashimi was...melt in your mouth GOOD!Black Cod in soy sauce...YuM!Eggplant miso, the yellow miso was the best!Grilled Squid...Ummm....Everything I ordered, DeLiciOUS!A huge sake selection!
Justin Y.}Washington, DC}750}310}66}18}5}4/29/2013}First of all, don't get confused with the restaurant next door. I'm not sure if it's good or not, but it's not the same thing and I think it confuses a lot of people.My friends and I came to Sakagura at around 5:30 even though it opens at 6 because we didn't have a reservation and we heard that it gets crowded very quickly. We were the second group in line and was able to get a table (they did tell us very kindly that there was a reservation at the table for 8:15 so we'd have to vacate before then). We also ended up adding one more person (going from party of 4 to 5) and they graciously moved us to a larger table.Wow, the decor is fantastic! You need to go down to this basement in an office building, but once you enter the restaurant, you are transported to Japan. The ambiance is amazing - essentially it feels like feudal Japan but super classy. They have a free coat check and the host/hostesses were very polite. The waiter also helped us pick out an excellent half bottle of sake that was halfway between sweet and dry. It was the best sake that I had ever had. Now onto the food. I ordered the Beef Tongue and the Pork Karaage. The beef tongue was moist and soft, almost like the texture of braised short ribs with a tinge of the liver-like jelly firmness. It was the softest cooked tongue I have ever tried and it worked well with the spinach, potatoes, turnip, and sauce. There were a lot of pieces in it (though it did cost $13) so I didn't feel cheated. The Pork Karaage was a bit beyond average, though not something I would rave about. I liked the curry flavoring in the pieces, but it kind of just felt like deep fried pork (which it essentially was). My friends ordered the shumai (looked good but didn't try it), the ebi sticks (same thing with this one), natto over tuna (the natto tasted... well... fermented, as it should be. I don't think I'm used to the taste yet), the duck with scallion (this one tasted great, flavorful but not overly powerful. There was no gamey taste), and the salmon sushi over rice (OMG amazing, you can see the pearly nature of the fat marbling the salmon pieces. The rice was also cooked to perfection). There were a couple of other dishes too but I don't really remember them.The prices here are steep because for relatively small dishes, they are expensive. But for the price, you get quality. The freshness of the foods is obvious just from looking at the plates. It's tapas style so order multiple dishes and share among family and friends. It's a definite must-eat if you like Japanese food and willing to dish out Grant and Benjamin.
Rob R.}New York, NY}7}58}2}-1}2}4/17/2013}Have been keen to try this place for some time. Finally did so and left with mixed feelings.It started of on a bad foot with the unnecessarily rude two FOH women. We had a reservation for five people and one was running a little late (and we got there maybe 10 minutes before the reservation time). We could see our empty table and they just refused to seat us. I know the (I find unnecessary) policy of waiting until all guests have arrived but common sense and politeness should prevail. After we had been standing in the way of all other arrivals for a good 15 minutes I walked over to the front desk to try make them see the the sense that even if the 5th person didn't turn up, would it be so bad if only four of us ate? Before I could utter my second word one of the FOH women who had started to listen to me put her hand up and rudely cut me off in mid sentence to say something to the other FOH women. When I tried to restart the conversation, thinking they had finished, she curtly exclaimed,"we are talking!" I was so taken back, I was ready to give them a piece of my mind and walk out. If not for the other guests I wouldn't have hesitated. This attitude was completely unnecessary and uncalled for. When I finally got to say my part she actually agreed, said something to her colleague and took off leaving us there waiting while her colleague was not only too busy counting money to seat us but pretty well ignored other arrivals until she was good and ready.So we went in to the pretty cool decorated eating space where our waiter was very polite and professional but the food was really nothing special, probably tarnished by our rude entry. My partner who had eaten next door at Soba Toto said it was much better food and also very funky inside.Needless to say where we will be taking our visiting international friends next time they're in town.
Miss C.}New York, NY}1}30}0}-1}5}4/15/2013}The restaurant is nestled in the basement of an office building, and when i walked downstairs and turned the corner i was a little surprised to find a pretty big space. The decor is great and the place is pretty clean. Our waiter was knowledgeable and gave great recommendations regarding sake. prices are pretty reasonable also, and the food is of great quality.We ordered a lot of different items. we started with the soft boiled egg with uni and roe, delicious, gotta get it next time. We also got the uni soba, also delicious and very nice in the cold broth. We also ordered the grilled squid, which was cooked perfectly. The organic chicken option (forget the name on the menu) was fantastic with the yuzu  on the side. Rice balls with tuna and salmon was filling and i recommend ordering if you are a little nervous that the smaller dishes wont fill you up. The tuna tartar in everyones yelp photo was also delicious.
Emma M.}London, United Kingdom}2604}438}329}-1}4}4/10/2013}This was a bit like going into the matrix! We entered a very ordinary office building, went down some stars and suddenly came out into Tokyo! It was kind of hidden, full of Japanese diners (always a great sign!) and very busy. It was truly amazing food - I tried sea urchin sashimi and spiced pickles among other dishes, which were all spectacular. Oh, and it has the most amazing lavatory seats!
Susan Z.}New York, NY}75}113}126}-1}5}4/8/2013}I was in Japan a couple of weeks ago and was instantly transported back to Tokyo as soon as I stepped into Sakagura. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice enough to let us sample four different types of sake before we settled on a bottle of Sasaichi Junmai--clean, dry, and crisp. Here's what we had: Buta kakuni Pork belly - let me just start by explaining that I order pork belly at every place that offers it so I've had my fair share of pork belly but this is by far the best pork belly EVER. It's so decedent, juicy, and the fat is perfectly caramelized. This is a must try at Sakagura. In fact, order two. Kamo Roast slices of chilled roasted duck wrapped around scallion accented with basil sauce - this dish tied as best dish with the pork belly. The duck is perfectly cooked and the scallion on top provides a fresh contrast that cut through the strong flavor of the duck beautifully. The dollop of basil on top is the perfect finishing touch and adds a modern spin to it. Absolutely delicious! (it actually reminds me of my childhood with my mom's peking duck.)Onsen Tamago soft boiled egg topped with sea urchin and salmon roe in cold soup - amazing. The egg yolk is runny and works great with the roe and sea urchin. The soup was light and pulled all the different flavors together. Very interesting dish if you are feelng adventurous and want to try something different. Ikura Oroshi grated daikon radish topped with fresh salmon roe - Although it was probably the best roe I've ever had, I wouldn't recommend this dish mainly because I think there are better things on the menu to try. The roe was beautiful and was not overly salty like typical roe. However, the daikon wasn't very exciting since it wasn't seasoned with anything at all and I felt like I was wasting the roe if I contaminated it by eating it with the daikon since it muted the flavor. Satoimo Iridashi taro potato, eggplant and shiitake mushrooms fried in a light batter served broth - the mushroom and the dancing bonito flakes on top were my favorite parts. The taro was a bit chalky but otherwise, still a tasty dish on the heavier side. Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku grilled japanese eggplants served with three kinds of miso (eggyolk, spinach, and sweet red) - I loved the eggyolk and spinach but I thought the sweet red was a bit too sweet. Steak - thinly sliced, slightly seared, served cold - pretty tasty but very similar to the duck and I liked the duck a lot better. So in conclusion, must tries are the duck and pork belly although everything on the menu is amazing so you really can't go wrong. Can't wait to come back!
Kenny K.}Manhattan, NY}18}21}5}-1}4}4/5/2013}This place is a little ambiguous.I need to preface this by saying I went for dinner.It seems like they're going for a dining atmosphere, with reservations and lines and all that, yet they serve small plates (maybe half their menu) like an izakaya (bar), although they have a full rice dish/noodle meal section as well. But they also sort of let you linger with the sake, etc, like an izakaya, and have a huge sake selection. And their food is pretty salty for a Japanese place (that is trying to do legit dining food) which seems more fit for an izakaya, since drinking induces cravings for salty and fatty foods.Aside from that the food: I ordered a number of smallish plates.One was the karaage, fried chicken. I didn't expect much at all, because I've never had good karaage anywhere in the city. Usually, places fry them before hand, then fry them again when they receive an order, so it's really dry. But here, not only did it come out within a few minutes of ordering, it was really juicy and succulent, just the right amount of fry time. Certainly a first on my list. The seasoning on the batter was pretty great as well. A little salty for Japanese food, but probably under seasoned fo American standards. It was alright with me because I was drinking sake and I like a little saltiness with my alcohol.Eggplant three ways: I think they were all some sort of miso. It was a little too sweet for me, like I was having sweet potatoes instead of eggplants. There was one that was studded with large salt crystals, but that one may have been the sweetest version out of the three. I have also heard that a little bit of salt added to a sweet dish only enhances the sweetness. It was ok in small bites. It was cooked well, so that it wasn't too mushy or hard. Moist and juicy enough. I just wish they had allowed the natural flavors of the eggplant come through without obstructing it too much to the seasonings.Onsen tamago. Simple, pretty good. This one was actually not too salty, seasoned just right I think. It's a tiny little appetizer sort of deal, difficult to split with another person. Also, if you are not so adventurous of an eater, this may not be for you. My date did not touch it at all and kept saying how gross it looked as I ate it. I really like it actually: the whole thing is in a cold dashi broth, a barely cooked egg, some uni, some lightening herby greens including a small shiso leef, salmon roe, and one piece of something else that I think was a vegetable or maybe a mushroom of some sort. I loved the combination and together it was excellent: the salmon roe adds a kick of saltiness while the other parts are fairly mild; the egg runs all over the place (i mean, the WHITES are jiggling) and you get the fresh cut from the shiso, and what can go wrong with fresh chunks of uni? But yes, it looks gross. If you're a foodie, worth a try.Black cod: way too salty. You definitely need a bowl to rice to eat that, but stil it is a bit ridiculous how salty it is. I couldn't eat more than one bite because it was insanely obtrusive on my palate, but I think it might have been decently cooked. But it's less difficult to dry out a black cod than other fish because it's such a fatty fish. Even with rice, it would be pretty salty. Probably the saltiest black cod I've ever had in my life. And believe me, I've had a LOT.Hamachi sashimi with ponzu dressing, topped with chopped chives (I think it was) and accompanied by seasoned ground radish (the kind you usually get with soba, except seasoned with some soy sauced based vinegary stuff here): not bad. simple, the fish was decently fresh. not too sure about what the radish stuff is doing there. the seasoning-especially the vinegar-is a bit too strong to accompany the raw fish, although it is placed on the side so that you could adjust the portions to your own liking. Still, I think it was better without it.Soba: really simple, straight up soba, with the dipping sauce, scallions and wasabi. Really good, actually. I've had soba in pretty famous places in Japan, and this comes really close to it, if not as good. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's just soba done right. The dipping sauce is perfect too, not too salty, actually at all. Just one thing: I like radish in my sauce, but they didn't serve theirs with the ground radish. Still really good without it.I recommend everything I wrote about except for the black cod. Oh, and the service was good too. I sat at the bar, so I don't know how different it is on the floor, but I usually didn't have to wait around to ask for more water, sake, a menu, anything like that.I also got to watch them make chocolate soufflees while sitting at the bar. I was too full to try one, but next time I will definitely. They looked really good.
Christina K.}Long Island City, NY}7}17}3}-1}5}4/4/2013}One of my go-to japanese restaurants! The decor takes you back to Japan and the food matches the ambiance as well. We always end up ordering the crab rice (takes about 40 mins to cook so order it first), the uni soba (drooool), and tori kaarage (fried chicken) and we usually mix it up wtih a fish and seasonal veggie... For dessert - the black sesame creme brulee is a must have. When going with two people - we only need about 4 or 5 dishes and we are STUFFED... Service is always top-notch and attentive. I would recommend making reservations as I have seen walk-in people be turned away. Even though they may say on opentable.com it is full - try calling. I almost always get a table that way rather than opentable. Additionally, there is a time limit on your table - usually about 2.5 hrs which is PLENTY of time.
Erica T.}New York, NY}125}54}21}-1}5}4/2/2013}I love this place! One of my favorite japanese restaurants! I took my aunt here for my first time. We ordered two seaweed salads, they were so good. It's not the typical seaweed salad.. they have probably 4-5 different types of seaweed. I also really enjoyed the tuna tartare. I took my girlfriend here and we had the UZAKU for the first time, that was so amazing, it made her want to come back. The onigiris here are alright, they're a little carb overload for a regular onigiri. Too much rice and not enough topping, BUT I did really love the spicy cod roe one. They have a huge selection of sake. Although I'm not a sake fan, sitting by the bar, the bartender still tried to make me a delicious sparkling cocktail (cocktails are not on their menu). Awesome! Highly recommended. MUST MAKE RESERVATIONS. It gets super busy.
Ellen L.}Saddle River, NJ}1}35}0}-1}4}3/31/2013}The food is very authentic. They had quite an impressive selection of sakis. I particularly like the sea urchin cold noodles. It was very pricy, but week worth it.
Frank C.}Campbell, CA}131}96}75}-1}5}3/30/2013}As I walked through an office building's lobby, past the security guard, down a flight of stars, and beyond a curtain to reveal Sakagura, I wondered what it must have been like years ago when someone look at the empty basement and said "Yeah... a high end... reasonably priced... Japanese restaurant in here. Yeah... I see it."I tried the deep fried pork (wonderful, they must cook in great oil), thinly sliced beef with radishes (awesome flavor combo,) the Buta Kakuni stewed diced pork (insanely great flavors.) Plus I had unfiltered cold sake. Cost of everything, including tip, $54. For New York that is a good price.They are open until 12:30 am on Friday and Saturday.I can't wait to bring someone special with me to this place.
Michy E.}Fresh Meadows, NY}9}20}149}-1}4}3/30/2013}Sakagura had been bookmarked on my list of places to try and I was finally able to do so a few weeks ago. I went for lunch one afternoon and it was packed. The restaurant itself is a bit hard to find,as it is located in the basement of a building. When walking on 43rd street, you will first pass by a very similar restaurant located on the ground floor. I actually almost went in there as the menu was similar to that of Sakagura. I decided not to go in when I saw that the name of the restaurant was different. I walked a few feet forward when I was greeted with a Sakagura sign which was placed by the entrance of an office building. I made my way down the stairs where there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated. I gave my name to the hostess and was quickly brought to a seat by the bar. I glanced over the menu several times and finally decided on the lunch tasting menu for $30. The sashimi and appetizers were brought out first and everything was delicious. The appetizers consisted of some asparagus marinated in a soy sesame vinegar sauce and some homemade tofu(drool). The sashimi pieces were very fresh and I was able to enjoy five different types of it. yumNext they brought out a bowl of cold homemade soba along with some pickles. I never really liked pickles and this was no exception. The soba was okay but not mind blowing like I had originally thought it would be. As I was enjoying my soba, there was a stand with three plates placed in front of me. My mind is definitely bigger than my stomach. There was no way I could finish all of this. On the top plate, there was tempura which consisted of a shrimp, a piece of sweet potato and a small piece of fish. The second plate was a marinated piece of grilled fish (super yummy), and on the final plate, there was a piece of steak with a Japanese steak sauce. Everything was cooked to perfection.I wasn't even able to finish half the things on my plate when the waitress asked me what I would like for dessert.  I chose the black sesame creme brulee and was only able to savor two bites before I could not eat anymore.  Overall, it was a great experience.  It has a nice ambience and the food is delicious.
Sun K.}Los Angeles, CA}4}50}19}-1}4}3/29/2013}I like this place...similar to aburiya kinnosuke..but smaller seating. Its packed so make reservations....nice decor, great food and ambiance..
Elle L.}Century City, Los Angeles, CA}456}400}898}18}4}3/25/2013}On street level, you'll walk past the door a few times and never know its actually inside a office building entrance. Walk past the other japanese soba place with the red doors and look for glass doors that look like the entrance of an office building. Right before the elevators there's a industrial door that looks like it goes into a broom closet. Take the never ending stairs down to the very bottom. Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.The spaces are tight, loud and everything that resembles Tokyo.We came with a party of 12 which is a bad idea. Everything is small shared plates, each plate only enough for 2 people. At 12 people, it gets very pricey. Everything we had was amazing. Except for the mountain vegtables, that was passable. Huge huge selection of sake, I mean the menu itself is like an encyclopedia.We left very drunk and still very hungry. Would visit again, with a smaller group.oh, and bathrooms are awesome and have bidets. Go bidets.
Rainbowz R.}Milford, CT}0}33}0}-1}5}3/24/2013}Don't be discouraged by the basement walkway that you have to traverse in order to reach this gem. We ordered the beef tongue, scampi sashimi, pork belly, and their special order of alaskan crab rice. I don't even like beef tongues, but this one was quite magical! The sashimi cleansed our palates, with the roe perfectly adding a little kick. The pork belly melted in our mouths. Serious question though, are you supposed to eat the fatty portion? Do let us know, but it was fantastic either way. The crab rice was very fragrant, but not particularly outstanding. Ended up choosing for dessert the sesame creme brulee. There are no adequate words to describe it other than holy %$#.
Abe D.}Manhattan, NY}3}6}1}-1}5}3/20/2013}Truly amazing. The Pork Belly was a good dish. I was most impressed with the salmon roe, uni, and poached egg dish.
Elisa C.}New York, NY}69}58}29}-1}4}3/19/2013}Outstanding dinner spot. WORTH NOTING: lunch might as well be a different restaurant, different menu, service, crowd, etc. bummer.
Brittany B.}Manhattan, NY}13}18}0}-1}5}3/19/2013}This was an all around great experience. First tip, make a reservation. We made it there around 7 PM on a Monday and we were told we'd only have the table until 8:45. Sure enough, around 8 parties of people piled into the basement to chow down on what was pretty great food. And though we had a time limit on our table, which seemed like a sour start, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful through out.This place made me a Saki fan. There's an extensive list, I know nothing of Saki, but the staff does and their selection was spot on. The tuna sashimi was pretty memorable. I'll be dreaming of the white fish for a while too. Go with a party, order two to three dishes each and get at all that good stuff!Additional perks - you're in a basement so besides being all cool underground like you've found the hot spot people venture to in music videos or whatever, there's no cell service. Just enjoy the food you're eating, the Saki you're drinking and the company you're with, uninterrupted by jingles. Also, the toilets are great.
Sally C.}San Francisco, CA}1051}406}232}18}4}3/19/2013}I came back to Sakagura last night for the first time in years. It was a delicious treat. For those of you who haven't been here before, it's literally in the basement of a building. You'll walk past the doorman and go down the stairway on your left. One if the first things we noticed was how many people there were in the restaurant despite the fact it was snowing. Then we realized how many these people were Japanese! I think that is a testament to how authentic this restaurant is. Everything you get here will be pretty small portions. You probably will want to order multiple dishes (2-4 per person depending on size and your particular party). We ate the following: Chilled roasted duck (4 stars) Really well prepared! Was fresh, thinly sliced, really yummyBraised pork belly (5 stars!!!!!) Just as soft and tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned as I remember. Would give it more stars if I could. Mashed potato coated in sweet donut batter (4 stars) More like mochi than mashed potatoes, interesting concept but strangely blandBlack cod (3 stars)  I didn't like particularly like the way the cod was prepared, but it was good Wasyu beef (3 stars) This was a special and I was not really impressed. Even though it was brought out on a hot stone to cook in front of our eyes, the meat was not as tender as I thought. Perhaps we overlooked though, so might have been user error. Uni soba (3.5 stars) Also on the specials menu. The uni was really good and they had a great infused brothEarl Grey ice cream and Green Tea ice cream (4 stars) 5 for earl grey, but green tea was standardBlack sesame creme brûlée (4 stars) Black sesame ice cream was spectacular but the brûlée a tad too sweet for me (though it didn't stop me from chowing down anyway)Overall I would rate it a 4. The bathrooms are super cool. We saw a cockroach in the stairwell as we walked out...oh the joys of NYC.
Dawn T.}Manhattan, NY}0}13}0}-1}5}3/15/2013}Wow - they have so many reviews and they deserve it! This is my go-to for great Japanese food in NYC. Stellar food presentations, great service, amazing saki selection!
M. Y.}Manhattan, NY}0}39}0}-1}5}3/14/2013}nice delicate japanese tapas. perfect noise level- quiet. good selection of sake. great experience.
Maressa T.}Manhattan, NY}52}55}0}-1}5}3/14/2013}Make a reservation. This place is always packed. And  the service is always perfection.Make sure you order...pork bellyonsen tamagoblack sesame creme bruleeThank me later! :)
Ellen C.}Manhattan, NY}30}103}5}-1}5}3/10/2013}This is on my top 10 favorite Japanese restaurants. The food is so flavorful, unique, well presented and fresh. I love the salmon sashimi but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, I promise!
Hermany N.}New York, NY}173}61}0}-1}5}3/9/2013}Nice place!!! We waited for about 10 minutes for a table at 11PM on a Saturday night, and it's totally fine. We didn't order any food but just some sake. They have about two hundred types to choose from, divided by how polished it is. If you go in a group I'd recommend try the semi-dry one, warm instead of cold. They can make it half bottle or 250ml. A little bit expensive, but come on, here everything's not cheap, and the location is great, friendly service!
Denise D.}Manhattan, NY}196}3}0}-1}4}3/9/2013}Fantastic izakaya.  Extensive sake menu, great ambience.  Excellent grilled squid, miso rice balls, and authentic Japanese service.
Cat C.}New York, NY}46}156}1355}18}4}3/9/2013}I've been to Sakagura a few time and it's one of the places that I take out of town guests to.Food quality is good, good flavor and reasonable prices for New York.Pork belly- must get, meatis very tender and very flavorfulSashimi- Very fresh and good qualityUni noodle soup- not much an uni fan, but this was delicious and the taste just grows on youCod- great flavor and cooked perfectly, meat was still tenderMAGURO NATTO - refreshing dishDessert- Sesame option, yummy and make sure you save room for it!
Fearless P.}Manhattan, NY}1}62}13}-1}5}3/6/2013}Hidden gem.  Love this place. food is amazing, sake selection is unbelievable.  Well decorated.
Mandy L.}New York, NY}115}623}1591}-1}4}3/5/2013}Not much hasn't been said about this spot, which is one of my favorite izakayas.  I recently made two new discoveries.  My friends and I ordered the grilled oysters which was a special for the night.  Usually don't like cooked oysters but this was really good and the presentation was beautiful.  I also found a new obsession--Yuzu Omoi Sake which is refreshing, fragrant, and slightly sweet.
Jen O.}Kingston, MA}0}7}3}-1}4}3/5/2013}Huge fan! So fresh, sat at the sushi bar. This will absolutely be a regular visit for me.Tasmanian Sea Trout, Chile Smoked Crab, the freshest Eel have ever had.
Nhu T.}New York, NY}77}70}162}-1}3}2/28/2013}Hmmm I'm sad that I didn't enjoy this as much, and my party of 4 agrees. Everything was subpar and the sake they recommended wasn't great. Note: I'm not a sake drinker. Usually staff at other places make the right recommendations for me, after hearing my likes and dislikes, but sadly i didn't enjoy it as much. My friends didn't enjoy their sake recommendations either. KARAAGE: okay, not as crispy and tender as other placesSAIKORO STEAK: the only great dish here that made me go yummm. EBI SHINJO: sounds great on paper, but didn't taste great. pretty plain taste. CHAWANMUSHI: pretty decent, but not the best FLUKE CARPACCIO: should have gotten sashimi insteadMAGURO TARTAR: i like my tartar a certain way (simple and with avocado and some sauce that would blend the flavor well), so i'm pretty picky. my friends liked it, but it was too much for me. I didn't even take a picture because it looked too much for me lol.TORI TSUKUNE: not as good as aburiya kinnosuke. JAGA DANGO: never tried something like this for me, but it was goodsome steak dish you grill on a rock: fun and good but proportions are sooo small. Dessert: very meh. we had two desserts to share. Ice cream and some cake.. not sure what we got though. but very forgettable. I even forgot we had dessert (till I uploaded my pictures and had to re edit this post) and that does not simply happen...The ambiance is pretty nice and there is always a crowd/packed. So there's that mood where you just want to drink. The toilets were fun too (heh) and I had a hard time finding it lol. But it's near the front in this hut looking shelter (looks cooler than it sounds). Since Sakagura has such high reviews, i would want to come again and try different dishes and sake. But as of now it's a 3.5 star restaurant for me.
Julie L.}New York, NY}63}94}112}-1}4}2/28/2013}So delicious! Super random location but fantastic decor and ambiance once you make it downstairs into the restaurant, which makes it into a great date spot.Love that you can try tons of different tapas style dishes. This place is suitable for the adventurous types. We really liked the IKA SHIOKARA, SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU and UZAKU. The portions are small so you can have a taste of lots of different flavors.
Grover B.}Paris, France}2}86}0}-1}2}2/23/2013}Service was excellent; could not ask for anything more. However the food was mediocre at best. This place serves small portions of food like a Spanish tapas bar. No problem here. But the quality of the food was nothing special. The pork belly (their signature dish) was mainly fat.  And while some may find the basement quaint is more dungeon like than cava.
Katie W.}Manhattan, NY}200}525}334}-1}4}2/21/2013}Sakagura is a little hard to find - it's in the basement of an office building and you don't get very good service down there, so if you are meeting someone who may be lost I would wait upstairs.  I came here for dinner with one of my professor's from college who was in town.  The restaurant is really authentic, from the food and decor to the electronic toilets in the bathrooms!  They gave us a big table, so it is good for groups and business dinners.  We didn't really know what to order but everything came out great!  I recommend reading other reviews before you go to get food suggestions!
Irene H.}New York, NY}208}1132}276}18}4}2/20/2013}For lunch only:This is my favorite place to go if I have time on Friday for a proper lunch. Reservations are highly recommended if there is more than 1 eating. If it's not available on OpenTable - try calling. They hold tables for 10 minutes max.If you need to be connected 24/7, know that not every spot has wireless coverage. I'm obsessed with the jewel oke bento because I love the combination of sashimi, some rice, tempura, eel, yams, etc. The quality is worth the $20. They also had a ridiculous sounding uni entree, but it sounded too rich that day to whet my appetite. There is something for everyone on the menu. I had to take a star off for the service though. If you sit at the bar (which is mostly for walkins and solo diners), it can take FOREVER to flag down someone to get you your check. I also had to wait 30+ minutes for my lunch once...
Eric Y.}New York, NY}413}160}75}-1}4}2/20/2013}Sakagura.... I gotta tell you .  I've kind of avoided this spot because it feels like a run-of-the-mill japanese sushi joint.   it is located on the basement floor of a ordinary building, a couple of friends convinced me we had to try it out. So we did.Our waitress spoke really poor English.  She had a hard time understanding what we were saying so we had to point and she wrote down the order.  Unfortunately, our order was mixed up.  We didn't make a fuss just moved on.  We ordered cocktails which were way tooooo sweet. yuck!   The matche green tea was decent but it was scathing hot so be careful.  I really like the Asian style bathrooms kinda unique.   Prices were standard NYC flair.  Our dishes were really good even though our waitress mixed some of them up.  One of the dishes we did eat was the pork belly miso beef stew. Which was tender and extremely fatty (felt my arteries literally clog may need a cardiac catheterization afterwards, lol!).I'm not sure that this is my go to spot but I was impressed with the variety of items and the quality of the food. One of the few times you leave a Japanese restaurant  feeling satisfied... and don't need to eat again in an hour.
S. Y.}Manhattan, NY}14}27}1}-1}5}2/19/2013}I was very impressed by the quality of food at Sakagura. Everything was perfectly seasoned, impeccably served, and really delicious. The coffee jello dessert and the other desserts are a must try, simply amazing! I love trying Japanese dishes and straying from the usual sushi roll or sashimi plate, and Sakagura offers the perfect variety of small plates to indulge in. To me the portion sizes were generous/adequate and prices were fair. Can't wait to go back already!
L C.}Brooklyn, NY}0}16}4}-1}5}2/18/2013}Sakagura is a hidden gem.  It's a unique dining experience.  I felt that I was transported to a wonderful basement restaurant in Japan.  The waitstaff is friendly but not overly intrusive.  The menu is full of wonderful dishes.  I really loved the duck, the eggplant, the pork belly, and the beef tongue.  Dessert is a must. One of the most relaxing and beautiful dining experiences to be had!!!!
Christopher L.}ASTORIA, NY}17}5}0}-1}5}2/17/2013}Sakagura has undoubtedly been my favorite restaurant ever since my buddy took me here for my birthday four years ago. There is an unmistakable allure to this place, from its status as a hidden gem, to its decor and its ambiance, and finally to the fact that you really can't go wrong with any of their food. It is one of those rare places where every experience of mine has been flawless.When I go here for dinner, I usually find that eight of their surprisingly filling tapas-style dishes are enough to serve two people. I always get the same four dishes* and then another four that are relatively new to me. Dessert to top things off is a must. For the non-drinkers, dinner without sake will run two people about $100 in total; those who do drink will probably pay anywhere from $120-150.Since my first visit, I've gone no fewer than ten times, with friends, and lady friends, for first dates (and last). I will conclude by saying this: if you're looking for a place where you can show off your expertise with chopsticks to a date, Sakagura is it; order the fluke carpaccio, which comes with plenty of itty bitty salmon roe.*Here follows the 4-dish core of each of my Sakagura experiences:1. KAMO ROAST: Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce;2. FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf;3. BUTA KAKUNI: Sakagura's Special Stewed Diced Pork4. SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU: Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso (Eggyolk, Spinach, and Sweet Red)
Alice C.}Los Angeles, CA}237}226}0}-1}3}2/16/2013}Sakagura was ... pretty good.  The Mister and I ordered the radish salad, the tofu salad, the rich stewed pork, one chawanmushi and shared a sashimi platter.  We wanted some "different dishes" and didn't want to be weighed down with anything deep fried (as much as we love tempura).  Both salads were exceedingly fresh and had unique flavors.  For example, the tofu salad had bits of preserved vegetable and the tofu salad had roe in the mayo dressing.  The sashimi was surprisingly excellent; my favorite was the uni, which had a rich, sweet flavor.  We asked the waitress to select some sake for us.  I don't remember what we had (doh! forgot to write the name down), but it was really lovely, not too sweet, super smooth and beautifully presented.  Service was decent.  I didn't notice the decor much, besides that it was a huge cavernous space, which I actually don't like so much.  The restaurant is subterranean, and you have to go through an office building to get to it.  Why only three stars you ask?  Though I don't usually make note of stuff like this, some of the customers were really, really obnoxious.  You know the type?  The "I lived in Japan for a month so now I think I know everything about Japanese culture" type?  Yeah, there were a lot of those people.  Overall, we had an enjoyable time.
Amy G.}San Francisco, CA}360}286}14}18}5}2/8/2013}This is a really awesome, truly unique, one of a kind place. Came here with a friend for dinner--frend ordered two small plates and I ordered a salmon sashmi in a bowl of rice, which came with miso soup. Dishes were very fresh and excellently prepared, albeit on the smaller portions side. I personally wouldn't call the food "stellar," but it's definitely delicately prepared. Based on food alone this place would probably get a 3.5, but it's really the ambiance and decor that gives it the 5 it deserves.The ambiance here is honestly unrivaled. The place is super hard to find on the outside because you need to walk through a residential-looking building. Then you walk down two flights of really sketchy (but wide) stairs and when you enter it's like WHOA you're on a different planet. It's really voodoo and cultish in a way, but the atmosphere is super relaxing and unique.
Poop D.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}1}2/8/2013}I am embarrassed that I bought into the hipster-hype of this place.Japanese tapas? Are you people just ignorant?Most of these items are available at every other Japanese restaurant in the world.You've never noticed because you've never looked at the menu past the sushi/sashimi offerings.Feel like you are in Japan? Puh-leeze. This is a hipster's idea of what Japan is like.New York is full of Japanese restaurants that have the real feel of Japan....and it ain't this place, sister.Over, over, overpriced glasses of sake. The only item worth ingesting is black-sesame ice cream on black-sesame creme brulee. Period.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
Taryn C.}New York, NY}271}714}28}18}4}2/4/2013}This. Place. Is.  Awesome!!I wasn't sure what to expect.  it's very rare, IMO, to find a purely **Japanese** restaurant, that doesn't solely cater to the sushi crowd.  They have lots of small plates, and lemme tell you...it was ALL GOOD.  First, my friend invited about 7 of his closest buds (myself included) for a night of sake and Japanese food.  He took us into this basement shady looking place, that basically I thought we'd need a password or secret handshake to get in.  WE didn't.  But you should have a reservation for sure for larger parties.  We had some of the best sake I've ever had in my life.  I'm not giant fan of Sake, and some of it can be an off-flavor or bitter.  We had a dryer one and a sweeter one to split. They were both so good that we could not decide between the two.  Then the small plates.  Oh Em GEEEE. We had some deep fried tofu, which I'm used to some of the sweeter tofu (with a peanut sauce or sweet and sour sauce to dip), but this had a more savory mushroom sauce.  It was very good.  Their pork belly is considered one of the best things on the menu. I'm not a HUGE fan of pork belly unless it's bacon. But this was good.  I probably wouldn't order it again, but it was good.  I took a look at the deep fried mashed potatoes (you read that right).  They were deep fried in DONUT BATTER.  Uh, what the heck?  You wouldn't think they go together but they are like two birds and a feather.  Not a state fair item? Should be.  The shrimp balls w/ almond crust was a little overpowering with the almonds. Good, but would have liked more of a shrimpy flavor.We all had complimentary tea at the end of the meal.  No one got dessert...because we were all too full!! You won't break the bank coming here.Man. I live on the Upper West Side.  Getting to 3rd Ave in midtown is not easy.  But I'll definitely bring my passport and go through customs to get here again.  It was fab.
Horace B.}New York, NY}0}8}0}-1}4}1/30/2013}it's really hard to know exactly how to define the star ratings here. i have seen 3-star ratings that are 'this is a dump' and 'nice place'.sakagura is a very nice place, but perhaps not the absolute best (?). it's an above average restaurant with a superb sake list. if you are willing to take a 'walk' out of the box, the menu is actually quite interesting. there are some items that i'm not sure all the dishes are 'authentic' japanese, but they are wonderfully prepared and quite delicious.about price: expect to walk out with a much lighter wallet if you want to go thru some sake. and of course, why are you coming here if you're not drinking the sake? that being said, if you can cut down a little, it can be a relatively frugal evening at a very nice japanese restaurant.i have gotten out of there for $45 per person, but only 1 carafe per 2 people. not such a bad proposition for tasting a couple different sakes.some of my favorites: almond-sliver encrusted shrimp balls (shrimp? never saw a one, but it's tasty!), flash broiled oyster in the shell (special for the week) was really amazingly tasty. other things: jaja dango (it's a doughnut!), tori tsukune (chicken meatball - meh), edamame (dull).one comment about sashimi. this is *isakaya*, not a sushi bar. not sure why anyone really wants sashimi at an isakaya, but they do. even in japan. so: order it if you must, but *don't* expect much. they have too big of a menu to be overly picky about their fish.
Yon L.}New York, NY}343}121}15}-1}4}1/28/2013}Definitely a must try if only for the Black Sesame creme brule.Really fun location in the basement of an office building (where is my date taking me?!)Service was wonderful and the small plates were a wonderful way to try several delicious "tapas."Notably, the Pork Belly and the Beef tongue were SO savory and perfectly textured. I could eat those all day. The Fluke was also amazing (topped with Salmon Roe). Simple yet full of flavor. The Tuna tartar, spinach (sesame flavored!) and onigiri were nothing to write home about but only because everything else was so much better, not because they weren't good. Definitely a sweet date spot, but the restaurant is spacious so I can envision a comfortable larger party as well. AND with the small but surprisingly filling dishes, there's room for dessert. DEFINITELY get the black sesame creme brule. You will not be disappointed!
Mar C.}Manhattan, NY}66}152}10}-1}4}1/28/2013}I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. In short, it is expensive, well made Japanese food served tapas style so that your mouth can have multiple relationships at the same time. I love when the ambiance of a restaurant matches the food that they serve. Cannot describe how many times a beautifully decorated restaurant with snobby waitresses and teetering crowd are eating and -pretending- to enjoy mediocre food that is plated "pretty". Sakagura is located in the basement of a commercial building with a doorman who points to the door automatically as you walk in. I guess he can recognize a hungry person when he sees one. And as you progress downstairs, you are greeted by a friendly hostess and traditional Japanese decor. Recommend reservations! My date and I had a reservation, but the couple behind us did not and was quoted an hour plus wait. Most memorable dishes:Daikon salad - While I love daikon, this is a dish I recommend you skip. Basically it's raw daikon with mayo. I could not really taste the spicy cod fish roe part of the mayo. Buta Kakuni - Stewed pork was tender, juicy, and melted in the mouth. Order.Agedashi Tofu - Flavorful tofu, with a great soy sauce infused broth that tasted like a serving of sukiyaki on a cold winter night. Ebi Shinjo - Interesting to eat almonds covered fried shrimp balls, unfortunately this combination did not work well. Almonds kept on falling off, so you were left with a very greasy shrimp ball. Chinatown dim sum does it so much better.Onsen Tamago - Great combination of runny yolk with sea urchin and roe. Definitely enjoyed certain elements of my dinner. Not every dish was a winner, but there were enough good ones that lead me to want to come here again. Presentation and service were excellent. Just avoid those almond shrimp balls.
Jesse And Christy S.}New York, NY}41}248}20}-1}3}1/26/2013}The best way I can describe this is Japanese Tapas. I couldn't read the menu (because its hardly in English) but the food was alright. The service was pretty good but I'm pretty sure our table was the only group of white people in the restaurant. So its very authentic...I'll give them that. Its in kind of a weird spot in this random midtown basement but they've certainly decorated it nicely. Overall I had just an OK experience but I dont think I'll be coming back.
Robin L.}Washington, DC}5}22}11}-1}5}1/24/2013}The daily special is the thing to get. Otherwise, the handmade soba is pretty good hot or cold. For desert, get the black sesame crème brulée is the best. It comes with black sesame ice cream too.
Amelia C.}New York, NY}270}236}305}18}3}1/18/2013}Came here for a family dinner, and got to try a bunch of dishes. Was not really impressed with the flavors and quality of the dishes, with the exception of the black sesame creme brulee which was out of this world!The kamo roast (sliced duck with scallion and basil sauce) was not particularly tasty, but should've been, given it came in such small portions... I also didn't find the sea urchin over soba noodles to be a particularly fresh dish (did not compare at all to Yasuda's sea urchin). My sister did enjoy the sake oyako don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice), and that was a good size and filling from what she said.Overall, not very impressed for the hype this place has. Seating is also a bit cramped; it's a huge place but they really do try to fit in as many tables as possible. My grandma kept on knocking over this temporary bamboo screen that the waiters had put up in order to create a weak semblance of privacy for two tables that were too close to each other.
Paul D.}Silver Spring, MD}13}132}0}-1}5}1/17/2013}This is a mysterious Japanese restaurant that will transport you to Japan.  It's hard to find, but I was introduced to this place by someone "in the know."  When I want the serious sushi stuff, I go across the street to Yasuda.  But when I want to go to Japan, I come here.  There are so many items on the menu, you sort of have to sample them all.  It's like Japanese tapas.  Everything I've had here was amazing, and hard to describe.  They also have a tremendous selection of sake.  And service here is first-rate.The only time I was disturbed here was when a group of white people came and sat next to us and made a ton of noise.  Just remember that when you come here, be ready to be transported to Japan, and enjoy the place!
Jaxon K.}Englewood, CO}1}48}0}-1}4}1/16/2013}This must be a New York thing.  Tried to find this place while on business in NY.  Ended up at Soba Totto (because it's the exact same address!).  But no one will tell you that, because that's not cool.  Sakagura is like the speakeasy of restaurants. You have to be in the know, you know, daddy-o?  But you can also do like us and stand out front where you think it should be, and yell at each other for 10 minutes that the other person is wrong.  That works up an appetite. So I give it 4 stars for just causing us so much pain to find.  Because I am convinced it doesn't exist. But the food was great - in my mind.  Happy hunting!
Tiffany M.}Pasadena, CA}123}52}4}-1}5}1/11/2013}One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city. I've been 3-4 times already and every time I visit, I leave happy. It is suitable for all occasions. I've been with friends (group of 6), boyfriend's birthday, and a business dinner. They have an extensive sake restaurant and fancy heating toilets. Would definitely recommend to friends and would be back again soon.Have to Get: Kakuni, Tuna TartarDownside: None!
John B.}Palm Springs, CA}0}18}0}-1}3}1/5/2013}It was good but not amazing. There are many better Japanese restaurants in NYC. I was visiting and was not impressed the experience could have been better with a good server but ours was pretty lousy.
Ali S.}Washington, DC}255}306}40}-1}5}1/1/2013}I only had dessert here, but it was outstanding.Black Sesame Creme Brulee was really interesting.  It was delicious, but it was not as good as the Sea Salt Chocolate Sorbet.  That was INCREDIBLE.  I've never had anything like it.  You must try it!
Zeus M.}Sacramento, CA}3}89}2}-1}5}12/31/2012}This is among the best Japanese food savored by this well-travelled lover of  anything Nipponsei.  It stands out among the best of restaurants in L.A., Hawaii, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Napa, S.F., and the Pacific Northwest.  I can't wait to go back!
M L.}New York, NY}7}82}8}-1}3}12/29/2012}i can't believe this place got 4.5 stars on yelp. this place was JUST OKAY. i've been to yasuda across the street, and aburiya kinnosuke only a short distance away and both BLEW MY MIND, so i had huge expectations coming into this dinner.i'm going to sum up my review in a sentence before diving into the details: if i had to pay the same price for this meal and had to choose between this place and aburiya kinnosuke, i would go back to AK in a heartbeat. i will probably never come back here again....it was underwhelming. why? first of all, this place was a pain in the ass to get a table at. the first time i tried to have dinner here, the hostesses told us there was going to be an hour+ wait on a friday night around 7pm. understandable, but crappy.when i finally made a reservation to return, it was painful to talk to anyone over the phone (their reception is terrible) and i had to settle for an earlier dinner time. i was happy once i arrived at the restaurant that we were seated at the bar since we got to interact with the bartenders and check out what else was happening in this place. what we ordered:-salmon sashimi don with salmon roe with miso soupthe salmon roe was excellent. the salmon sashimi was just average, even a little dry. i was happy with this dish because of the quality of the salmon roe. it was tasty. -beef short ribthis was good but the short rib was cut into tiny chunks so after you stuck a chopstick in the dish once, it was reduced to hundreds of strands swimming in gravy. could have been better.-cold, fresh tofu with gingertofu was excellent. -onigiri with pickled plumthis was good. be prepared for a helluva sour pickled plum! they also include pickled cucumber on the side of this dish that is pickled with oba leaf. if oba leaf is not your favorite thing in the world (it is not my favorite thing in the world), then you will likely not enjoy these. -tuna sashimi with 'grated' mountain yamthis dish caused the most unexpected reaction. you would assume from the name that 'grated' implies something that is like, shaved/thin and resting on top of the fish. not at all. the mountain yam or whatever it is is basically turned into a slimy paste and the fish is buried underneath it. i would not have ordered this dish if i had known it was going to be served this way. the tuna was high quality, but i would definitely pass on this, unless you're into slime piles.-dessert: pear millefeuilleaverage. i should have gone with the creme brulee everyone else was yelping about. pass. pros:-it really doesn't feel like you're deep underground in the stank basement of a a nondescript  70s office building, once you're in the restaurant (is this actually a pro? i'm not sure)-bartenders have excellent knowledge of all of the sakes served here and are very helpful if you are new to sakes - they will let you sample lots of yummy stuff and make some recommendations. we ordered a sake called KEN and it was excellent.-as other yelpers mentioned, cool japanese toilets :)-good atmosphere - the restaurant is not overly crowded, the noise level is pleasant and they play some good jazz in the backgroundcons:-this place is expensive for what it is. seriously. even though the sake was good, most of the glasses started at $11 and the stuff that was actually good (like the "Ken" was $25 a glass). -portions are really small-while the bartenders are knowledgeable and wonderful in terms of helping you choose sake, there is a SERIOUS disconnect at this restaurant in terms of bar service. we were served dish after dish with new bowls and utensils placed in front of us, without the last setting cleared. by the time we were finished eating, there were about 10-12 random empty dishes sitting in front of us. this was really strange and cluttered, especially since we were sitting at the bar.-dessert was just average. earl grey ice cream on the dessert had a strange aftertasteoh, did i mention that i was still hungry when i left this place?BAD SIGN!!!!!Tip for anyone willing to head into Brooklyn for excellent japanese food:try Hibino in Cobble Hill!!!!!Hibino's homemade tofu is amazing and made fresh daily. The beef short rib is my favorite and will not disintegrate before your eyes (and before it enters your mouth).It's worth the trip!!!!
Lars F.}Setagaya, Japan}45}513}611}18}4}12/28/2012}I went here for lunch today for a "bounenkai" with my co-workers and ordered the $30 tasting set. Wow! First a plate of sashimi, then cold soba followed by tempura, fish, and steak. Finished the meal with the goma creme brulee. The food was very good and for that price we all were surprised. It looked light, but we were full.
Rachel G.}Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}12/20/2012}This is the best Japanese restaurant I've been to in NY.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  The menu is a fantastic combination of traditional Japanese and modern, inventive dishes.  I love this place.
Bertrand R.}Vancouver, Canada}34}216}8}-1}3}12/20/2012}Clean food and "good" flavours but nothing amazing. I would go for a regular office lunch but this isn't somewhere I would seek out.I am really surprised by how busy it was actually.
Jess K.}Manhattan, NY}283}268}2}-1}4}12/17/2012}This restaurant is definitely for those in the know - fortunately I was with someone who was... how else would I have located this basement restaurant in a random office building' in Midtown? Walking down the stairs and hallways normally dedicated to HVAC and conduits, the only evidence of a Japanese restaurant were a few silk screens and a discreet sign next to the entrance. Though walking through the entrance, our surroundings were completely transformed. The inside was trimmed with bamboo and adorned with demure, authentic Japanese fabrics and decorations. Our waitress was very helpful and navigated us through the extensive sake list. She chose a sake that was both fruity and dry, it was delicious... I only wish I could remember the name... I would order it again.We started with the tofu salad, the tofu was soft and flavorful and played well with the lettuce and miso dressing. We also got the fluke sashimi with olive oil, eat bite was perfection and the taste combinations were delightful. I would definitely order both again. The ebi sticks are a must, I really different way to serve summer rolls.The tamago with eel was okay, not our favorite, it was a cold dish, so the texture was a little off. Also the shredded beef, while cooked perfectly, was not unique or memorable. We also had the eggplant with bonita flakes, very good.Dessert is a must - our waitress recommended the black sesame creme brulee, not something I would normally order, but it was amazing. We saw the chef making the dessert at the bar and the focus and artful way he was firing the brulee, I knew it would be amazing, it was, the flavor of the black sesame was unique and not too sweet.Would definitely go back... next time will make reservations, it was getting packed and we left at 10!
laura s.}Washington, DC}28}43}0}-1}5}12/16/2012}A real gem. I didn't know what to expect as I enter what appeared to be an office building and went down some steps. I walked in and was struck by the inviting and cozy restaurant. The list of sake was outstanding, as was the waiter who recommended different ones to try.For food we had the following which was excellentHirame Ponzu (this was so refreshing, I could of had 3 dishes of it)Ebi SticksMaguro Natto (my husband liked, it wasn't my type of dish, I realize fermented soy beans aren't my thing)Gyu Miso Nikomi (completely melts in your mouth)If you like authentic Japanese dishes and an impressive sake list, you won't be disappointed!
Norases V.}Stanford, CA}466}104}779}18}5}12/13/2012}Sakagura has never disappointed me. They have small dishes so you can try a lot of things. Their specials are also always really good. My crab rice claypot was the best! My favorites are their sea urchin, duck, salmon don, and black sesame creme brulee!
James H.}Buffalo, NY}1}31}0}-1}5}12/11/2012}4.5 starsLunch special - one of the best values in nyc (especially on thursday). All the dishes are yummy. Buta kakuni, fluke carpaccio, cod, karaage, etc.
Yoon U.}New York, NY}13}64}1}-1}4}12/9/2012}Great izakaya place, at an affordable price.  It is a little hard to find, since it's located at the basement of an office building.  Once you walk in, you'd be surprised to find a large and nicely decorated Japanese restaurant. You don't get cell reception when you are in the restaurant, so def make a list of what you want to eat from the yelp reviews before you get to the restaurant!  We went right when it opened at 6 pm, so we were able to get seated at the bar right away. This is what we ordered:IKA SHIOKARA :  Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver MarinadeBUTA KAKUNI :  Stewed Diced Pork  TORI TSUKUNE :  Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce GYU MISO NIKOMI :  Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon RadishGINDARA YUAN YAKI :  Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce Also had the fried chicken, and the black sesame creme brulee and the pear millefeuille with earl gray ice cream.  All of the dishes were solid, but my favorite was the gyu miso nikomi.  The meat was perfectly cooked and it was a good balance between sweet and savory.  I  used my spoon and ate every bite of that sauce.  The raw squid was definitely interesting and unique.  It has a very buttery taste, and while it's good, I'm glad it comes in a tiny portion.  The buta kakuni is such a guilty pleasure.  It has a thick layer of fat which is what makes it taste so good.  Just don't think about it and eat it.  It comes in a single portion, but I ended up sharing it with a friend, and we both thought it was the perfect portion size because it is very rich and fatty.  And for the dessert.  the black sesame creme brulee is great, and a must try.          I was surprised that there were a lot of empty tables at the restaurant, but had a long line of people waiting to be seated, probably those without reservations.
Pamela D.}Rochester, NY}0}4}0}-1}4}12/4/2012}A jewel that is hidden in the basement of an office building!  Sparkling sake!  Pork belly.  Every nuance addressed for the most discriminating palate.  And ladies...there is always a line for the ladies room.  Let me just say, it is an experience...full service!
James K.}El Cerrito, CA}232}475}163}18}5}12/2/2012}I came to Sakagura once a long while ago, and I'm glad I came back recently. I didn't remember much of my first visit but just that I had loved the food. My friend and I wanted sake and we were nearby Sakagura. We ordered several plates to share between three people and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.Ponzu hirame - fresh and direct, just exactly what I was craving. Tamago yaki - not just egg but had other things too, which added flavors and textures and I enjoyed it. Chawanmushi - this was one of my favorite of the night. The egg was cooked just right and I loved the sauce.Pork belly - the skin part melted in my mouth, so scrumptious.Salmon and roe - over rice. Yummy and fresh.Kani gohan - crab meat with rice. The rice was sticky and flavorful, another favorite of the night for me.I had such a delicious meal here, and I have many more items I'd like to try one day.
Robert L.}New York, NY}217}209}153}-1}5}11/30/2012}Sakagura is one of my all time favorite izakayas, ever!The restaurant itself is a little hidden.  It's in the building that's immediately west from the Central Parking System car park.  During normal operating hours, there will be a nice little sign set up outside to give you a little clue as to where you might find this little gem.  Once in the basement, the room opens up into a beautifully decorated restaurant with Japanese decor, including pillars with cherry blossoms sprouting out of them.Now the sake list they have here is amazing.  I'm not too knowledgeable about sakes in general and always ask for a recommendation for specials or seasonal offerings.  But what I really want to write about, is the food.  Oh the food...Ika shiokara, shiromi nanban, tofu salad, hirame ponzu, buta kakuni, gindara yuan yaki,  sake oyako don.. just to name a few of the things I really love.  The tofu salad's a must.  The tofu is chilled and and put on top of some vegetables with a miso dressing.  Its perfect for sharing, fresh, and delicious.  Next for the raw offerings.  The ika shiokara is great.  It's cured squid in a squid liver marinade which definitely is not for everyone but I can't get enough.  The hirame ponzu is fluke sashimi served with grated daikon with ponzu sauce (citrus soy sauce).  Lastly the shiromi nanban is not exactly raw but fried pieces of fish w/ perfectly julienned vegetables in a vinegar-y sauce.Now for the more substantial parts of the meal.  The buta kakuni.  Done so well here.  It's large pieces of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce based liquid.  If you like pork belly, don't share this one, just get your own.  The gindara yuan yaki is yet another amazing dish.  It is fillets of cod cooked perfectly in a sweet soy sauce.  The fish is so delicate and soft.  I could eat this one everyday.  Finally, I really do like the sake oyako don.  It's rice topped with salmon eggs and salmon sashimi with a soy sauce.  To be honest, it is not all that special but it is done so well and comes with miso soup, a perfect way to finish the meal.You can't go wrong at Sakagura.  Try it all, go wild, leave happy!
Jade Y.}PRINCE, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}11/28/2012}My personal sweet spot... Order the pork dumplings, chicken meatballs and donut battered mashed potatoes. Excellent selections of sake and incredible black sesame creme brulee. You will not regret venturing into the basement of an office building for this one. Make a reservation!
John L.}New York, NY}182}122}0}-1}5}11/23/2012}One of the best meals I've had in NYC. Everything was awesome but no big sake bottles... sadness.
David P.}Manhattan, NY}67}431}292}-1}4}11/22/2012}Ika shiokara: SALTY squid greatness! I cannot believe that after all these years, the way to enjoy very salty food was to pair it with a nice bottle of sake.Assortment of fresh sashimi: uni, otoro, salmon, hamachi and a 5th I forgot.Onsen tamago: deliciousness...really tough to beat soup with uni, soft boiled egg, and salmon roe. Please order it.Buta kakuni: nice chunk of stewed pork belly. good firm texture in a slightly oversalted broth. Again, another salty dish that is good with sake.Black sesame creme brulee: yum.Pear millefeuille: yum, but not as yum as the creme brulee.No rolls available. Sorry gringos.
Madhu R.}Washington, DC}89}625}23}-1}5}11/19/2012}Fantastic place! It's in the basement of a place that looks like an office building, so don't get scared off.  Went there in a group of 8, and they had a table reserved as promised.  We ordered a lot of small plates, and everything was inventive and delicious.  Staff was super friendly and helpful in recommendations.  The fluke was my favorite.  Fresh ingredients, nice atmosphere, and the bill didn't break the bank.  With tax and tip, it was $40 each for the 2 people who didn't drink beer/sake and $60 per person for the other.  Not bad for a fun night out.
Livia C.}New York, NY}13}39}4}-1}3}11/18/2012}Food was good. They need to be less snobby towards people who don't have reservations. seriously.
Lisa S.}Boston, MA}31}37}9}-1}3}11/13/2012}I ordered a tempura dish and it was delicious. Affordable and quality food. The restaurant was also filled with Japanese guests (I speak Japanese so I could tell), which is a huge indicator that this restaurant is authentic and delicious.
Tina Y.}New York, NY}0}196}0}-1}4}11/13/2012}We finally got a chance to have lunch in Sakagura last Monday (11/5), and now I can see why it is such a popular place on Yelp! This place was a bit hard to find in the first place, but the good food and good service made up for the slight inconvenience.We made a reservation for 12 pm, and we were seated at a table with a good view of the dining room. Their lunch menu was very extensive, and a bit disorienting for a first-timer like me. I settled with the daily lunch soba set ($11.50): hot soba with tuna and avocado over rice. The food was delicious, and the portion was quite generous. Immediately, I forgot about Ise, Haru, and other places that I usually went for Japanese lunch specials. I wish I could come here more often! I also have to note that their rice was cooked nicely -- it was so appetizing that I finished the whole big bowl.My husband ordered the Jewel Oke Bento ($20). which was an assortment sashimi, rice balls, and other appetizers. It was a beautiful set, and delicious as well.The restaurant was filled up pretty soon. It was bright, vibrant, and warm. Everyone looked very happy and satisfied.
Vinci Z.}Manhattan, NY}181}91}96}-1}5}11/13/2012}What an under-ground treasure... my favorite restaurants on the entire planet Earth. Would still be my favorite even if its $10-30 more expensive per person.Unlike Morimoto or Nobu, this place serves authentic Japanese food. If you have a better taste for fusion food, please go visit the other 2 I mentioned.The dishes that I always order:Fluke CarpaccioTamagoyakiIkura Oroshi  Gyu Miso NikomiGyutan Yawaraka NiThey used to serve a rice bowl with Kimchi and raw Tuna (forgot the name), it was amazing!! Too bad its no longer available. I also like the soba here, tastes really fresh and smooth. The $50+ tasting dish with 5 different types of fishes is another killer, they come in 3 pieces of each. I would recommend it for at least a party of 3 people.
Shamik T.}Washington, DC}22}157}0}-1}4}11/7/2012}Very cool place. Excellent service, and the food was good too. It's hidden deep underground -- no cell service (which can be a great thing). I went by myself and sat at the bar. It gave me a lot of time to think and observe, and I was better for the experience, without having to glance at my phone every few minutes.Excellent saki selection. Agedashi tofu was fantastic. Perfect size. I had the Akira noodle dish (hot). Very simple, very good. The two together however, was too much, in my opinion. The noodles fill you up quickly. And so cheap! I'm a fan. Can't wait to come back, this time, not alone.
Ryan F.}Manhattan, NY}1583}714}8020}18}5}11/7/2012}Deep beneath the crust of the Earth lies Sakagura...an underground oasis of Japanese awesomeness - just be ready to answer three riddles and cross a rope bridge to get here!  (But seriously, pay close attention to the street address or you'll wind up in either (a) the sushi place next door, or (b) nowhere/an office building)After almost coming here with a fellow Yelp-Elite, I found myself with another hungry foodie also ready to partake in the tasty small plates offered at Sakagura!  We split six selections between two of us:Ika Shiokara - A small plate of sliced raw squid in a salty squid liver marinade.  Although small, this is still good to split, as I would have probably found it too overwhelming in both salt and bitterness to down the entire thing myself.Hiyayakko - My friend chose this and ate most of it, but I managed to have a couple of bites.  She really liked it, but I was indifferent (I'm not a big tofu fan to begin with so don't listen to me!)  I did enjoy the crunch from the grated ginger and scallion flakes though.Sake Oyako Don - This was a bit larger than the first two, and one of my favorites.  Fresh strips of salmon and salmon roe (eggs) with soy sauce was served over a half-sphere of sushi rice.  The salmon was delicious and soft, and had nice stripes/marbling of the fat layers.  The miso soup that comes with this was unnecessary, but definitely welcomed.  Buta Kakuni - We ordered two of these, and, as others have described, this stewed pork is melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Along with the salmon, this was also a standout dish.  I highly recommend getting this, especially since it's small enough to "squeeze in" with other choices.Kama Roast - Slices of chilled duck wrapped scallion with basil sauce.  This was good, but not as good as the others.  It's also $10, but a decent portion for the price. Onsen Tamago - Sea urchin and soft boiled egg in cold soup - This was delicious, but definitely an acquired taste (sea urchin is very soft).  Even though this is a soup, it's still very "splittable" - chunks are small enough without doing too much cutting/piercing.With their exhaustive menu, I'll definitely be coming back again, but I'm thrilled we managed to conquer some great land and sea-based offerings on the menu.  Service was friendly and expedient to boot, and they also have a legendary saki menu, although we stuck to beers.
Cheryl H.}Manhattan, NY}0}4}0}-1}5}11/6/2012}It has become my new favorite Japanese restaurant in New York!The food was amazing! We had Onsen Tamago, which was a cold soup with soft boiled egg, sea urchin and salmon roe,  super yummy! Buta Kakumi is stewed diced pork belly, tasted very rich in flavor and texture. Gyu Miso Nikomi was my favorite! It was a stew beef ribs with grated radish. It was sweet, salty, and the flavor existed in my mouth for literally Two days! I also tried the spicy plum wine sorbet and jello shot, it was quite special too! We'll definitely go back again. Actually, we'd love to go again today!
A N.}New York, NY}114}22}0}-1}2}11/2/2012}This place is 2 of 5 stars for the following reasons:- Food was good, not amazing = -1 star - Supposed to open at 11:30am as the website, signs, and even security guard at the building said.  They didn't open til 12pm.  Kept people waiting.  In NY,  you should know better than waste someone's busy, precious time =  -1 star- For a Japanese place that considers themselves premium, instead of nice chopsticks, they use cheap throwaway wooden ones that gave me a splinter and cut my lip.  Hard to enjoy my meal when my lip was killing me = - 1 star
Josh B.}Stamford, CT}5}3}0}-1}3}11/1/2012}The reviews below (and likely above) are all accurate.  The food is really great.  BUT, this is Manhattan and it is not difficult to find fresh fish!  I only gave 3 stars because of the price.  To put it into perspective - a Sashimi platter with 12 pieces of fish is $51.  That's $18-25 anywhere else in the city for the same quality.  The sake selection is unrivaled and I will return for that; but there is no reason to spend so much on food.
Anna Y.}New York, NY}3}25}0}-1}4}10/20/2012}What you order here can really make or break your meal experience.What people don't really know is how amazing the sushi here is. They serve toro in the sashimi platter and it's all very good and fresh. The uni is amazing as well.I really love the buta kakani (pork belly) dish here. They have a dish with uni, poached egg and salmon roe in soup. It was a delight!Great place!
Tiger Lily ..}San Francisco, CA}30}340}3}-1}5}10/19/2012}amazing amazing food.we tried everything and it was all so so good.we had the sake, boiled spinach, egg custard, ribs, squid, seared beef, black cod, chopped tuna in yams, fried doughnut, pork belly...it was all soooo amazing. i love classic japanese flavors of ponzu and daikon...this is a new favorite place. in love.GET THE UNI SOBA!!! and fresh UNI...killer.
Stephanie Q.}Boston, MA}491}1502}1294}18}5}10/17/2012Updatedreview}This is a review for dinner. *tip: make reservations! It was pretty packed, even for a sunday night*tip: go to the toilet. They have the japanese toilets, so the seats were heated, and you can do all sorts of things like wash your ass. I wouldn't recommend washing your ass though because the next person waiting in line would have to wait forever.The dishes aren't that big, you might need quite a few to feel fulll.Now let's talk about food:-Homemade "nihachi" soba: We waited forever for this dish. Maybe the guy who was making it was tired or lazy. It was delicious though. They do not have sobayu at dinner time, only during lunch time.-Seaweed salad: can't go wrong with this. The seaweed (kaiso) tasted great with the sour vinaigrette dressing-Hirame ponzu: think slices of fish that were slightly sour. Amazing.-Fluke carpacio: not as good as the hirame ponzu. This dish came with salmon roe though, that was good.-Chikuzen Ni: one of my favorite dishes. Tender chicken cooked with vegetables- lotus, gobo, carrots etc.-Surumeika Yaki: I've never had squid cooked to such tender perfection. The tentacles looked scary though, so I did not eat those tentacles. They also have a daily special menu with a good selection of dishes.
seven s.}Oakland, CA}13}80}19}-1}5}10/14/2012}Whoa.  The best Japanese food in LIFE!  Awesome selection of sake, and every dish is amazing beyond belief.  Try everything.  Make reservations well in advance!
Will C.}San Francisco, CA}81}253}92}-1}4}10/14/2012Updatedreview}After a previous review of this restaurant was plagiarized, I've decided to make this review less plagiarizable (by a heterosexual female reviewer at least) and have compared dishes at Sakagura to actresses. I apologize if I offend anyone. Buta Kakuni - Mmm...you're like Minka Kelly? To keep this review PG-13, let's just say that my lips and tongue action stimulating your soft underside made for some explosive chemistry! My taste buds were going wild by 1-2 combo of looks and taste. Your smooth skin.... Your gentle tan line... Your brief, but memorable acting spot in (500) Days of Summer that saved everyone from Zooey Deschanel's awful acting. But, I digress. You're hot. And tasty. And totally worth coming to Sakagura for.Tori Tsukune- You're like Kate Upton. You have big jugs. But, that's sort of it. There's no depth to your massive, big jugs. Just like these meatballs, they're neither terribly novel nor interesting. The teriyaki sauce isn't terribly sweet, but it doesn't explode in your mouth either. Chawanmushi - The average girl, but marketed and priced like a B-list actress. I call you Aubrey Plaza. Rashida Jones (or ANN PERKINS!) is so much hotter, she's a HAA-vard grad and she was on Freaks and Geeks, but for some strange reason, you're the geek platoon's goddess. Steamed egg custard with bits of chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms is interesting, but I was expecting a heck lot more at $9. Not much value: shrimp, one chicken, one large mushroom, and bits of scallions and other random vegetables. Commoner food, but priced to compete with the other B-list dishes.Toilet- The toilet rocks. Japanese bidet function. I'll admit, I used it. And it felt really good having warm water squirting my privates and making them all clean. However, I couldn't find a warm dryer feature so I walked around with water soaking my undies-- not my proudest moment.There's only 1 men's room and 1 women's room. So be considerate when taking a deuce and don't get too involved in reading the financial section.
Allison M.}Manila, Philippines}88}216}283}-1}5}10/9/2012}This is my favourite bar in New York. Not only because they serve sho-chu, but because the food is incredible!I adore izakaya style food, and Sakagura, hidden in the basement of a high rise, does some of the best. The atmosphere of the place is immersive, with lots of wood and bamboo, with a modern touch. It's a beautiful place to relax and sample the dishes. The dishes are small, so you can order a few and not feel too full. None were very expensive, although after a few drinks, it does start to add up.My favorite was hands down the Uzaku - a delicate salad made with lovingly prepared pieces of high quality eel. So good!There was also a tuna and mountain yam dish, made with such high quality tuna that it felt as if it were melting in your mouth. Everything we tried at Sakagura was memorable and top-notch, not one bad dish!We were seated at the bar, and the bar tenders were all immensely helpful, even making my favorite shochu cocktail, although it wasn't on the menu. I know it sounds weird, but make sure you visit the restroom - the toilet has heated seats and more buttons than my TV remote.An incredible find, you won't be disappointed!
Gabriele K.}Fort Lee, NJ}11}48}0}-1}4}10/8/2012}The food was delicious and we really enjoyed the sake tasting. The small portions give you the opportunity to sample many different dishes without breaking the bank. Our two three dishes were the pork belly in broth and the grilled squid. The Sashimi was a little disappointing. At $50+ for 10 pieces we would have expected more. Anyway, we had a fabulous evening and learned a lot about sake.
Kira S.}Mountain View, CA}8}11}0}-1}4}10/4/2012}Love this place! One of   my friends in NY showed me this place and now I go there each time I'm in town. They have a really waste variety of rolls and sushi. The food is always delicious and fresh. Together with great service and nice atmosphere, this place is a little Japanese paradise in the area!
Nick C.}Houston, TX}17}17}0}-1}5}10/2/2012}I dine at a different Japanese place in Midtown east once a week for lunch, and Sakagura is as good as it gets.  I ordered a special with herring and soba, and the herring was fresh and fishy in that herring way, and the soba was as good as the specialty places around here.  The miso soup was excellent, in the top 10 miso soups I've had, and the sushi was almost as good as the top sushi places in town.  All in all a great experience.And then I went in for the izakaya.  Even better.  If there's a better izakaya in NYC, I haven't found it yet.  I could go here every week and be happy.  The dishes are varied, flavorful, and quite inexpensiveThe decor is memorable, with the underground den of sake adding flavor to the experience.  As others have commented, it's quite a trip into the underbelly of a office building to get there, but to be honest that just adds to the charm.Unfortunately, I have no sophistication when it comes to Sake, but I am told it is excellent.
LV C.}New York, NY}7}198}0}-1}4}10/1/2012}Sometimes it can be hard to get a reservation, and if you do, there can still be a wait. It doesn't matter what you order because everything on the menu is good. Which is a good thing, I suppose, since everything is tapa size- you can order a bunch of things. The desserts are also amazing, and I always find myself ordering more than one dessert. Place is a bit hard to find if you are a first timer. It's located inside a corporate building. As a matter of fact, it's in the basement.
Minsoo P.}Duluth, GA}59}32}2}-1}5}10/1/2012}Fantastic!!! Nothing like sushi places you've been. Refined and outstanding. Just look for it since its easy to miss. No cell reception in restaurant so you can enjoy without interruption.
Karntimon R.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}1}9/28/2012}Really bad service for a mediocre food. The lady with short hair and eye glasses who took reservation was very rude and unfriendly. It makes me question the polite Japanese I usually encounter. I will never go there again. If you plan to have guests or VIPs, take them to next door Soba Totto instead. Food is similar but everyone there are much more friendlier and accommodating.
Pierre S.}Manhattan, NY}28}124}5}-1}4}9/26/2012}Feels japanese. Delicious all around. Impressive sake collection that makes you realize you know nothing about nothing.
Deborah M.}Atlanta, GA}45}12}0}-1}5}9/26/2012}What a hidden jewel. A great idea, Japanese tapas!!!  The food was absolutely delicious & the staff was exceptional.  I was in New York celebrating my 44th birthday and was craving Japanese food so we searched & found this little treasure.   My mother, cousin and I dined on chicken meatballs,  chicken with root vegetables, pork tenderloins, chocolate souffle, black cod & a couple of other dishes & they were all delectable.  The next time I am in New York I will definitely dine there again.  A must try!!
Cynthia M.}Manhattan, NY}353}1225}25}-1}5}9/22/2012}Absolutely delicious Japanese food! Now I see why all the great reviews! My friend and I were able to get a reservation here for lunch and we ordered the special of the day, Uni soba and the Sashimi Don.The Uni soba was served cold and though I am usually not a fan of cold soups, this was perfection. The broth was rich and full of briny ocean flavor. The uni was not overpowering, it was just the right amount for the soup and went nicely with the soba noodles. This was truly a wonderful dish.The sashimi don was my absolute favorite though! I never usually order sashimi don, which I thought was just raw fish pieces over rice. I could not be more wrong. Each piece of sashimi had so much flavor that I almost believe that it was seasoned and marinated. The sushi rice was perfect and also flavorful with bits of seaweed strewn about. It was actually the Salmon Roe that brought this entire dish together and the flavor was super fresh and infused every bite with even more fresh seafood flavor. This dish goes down as one of my favorite Japanese dishes ever and I highly recommend it if you are here. I will definitely be back for dinner to try more dishes on their menu. I will also be back for some of that perfect sashimi don at lunch as well! Highly recommended!
wenting x.}New York, NY}95}81}9}-1}4}9/18/2012}this place is a gem hidden in the basement of an office building. seriously one of the best japanese restaurants out there.1) pork belly--to die for. it feel apart in my mouth and the meat just melted. also a huge portion for just $5!!2) the sea urchin cold ramen....omfg. this is probably one of the best dishes ive ever tasted. absolutely perfect. it was delicious and the urchin soup was to die for. its got this silky flavor...yum.3) duck app was pretty decent.  it was a tad over cooked, but flavors were great, the saltiness marinated all the way through the whole duck. 4) rice balls--very fresh salmon roe, rice had great texture and had he vinegar and salt taste in the rice (huge plus)a must try.
Sumika M.}LONG ISLAND CITY, NY}3}52}0}-1}4}9/17/2012}As far as GOOD JAPANESE IZAKAYA FOOD goes, I Think Sakagura is as good as it gets here in NYC. Woodsy, comfy atmosphere, kind staff, and great food. It is in the basement, so kind of a hidden jem of the city. As a Japanese living in NYC, I would say I go here at least once a month. It does get a little pricy, but it's like any tapas, so if you eat about 3 small plates, it will end up being about $20-25. In aJapanese Izakaya, the whole idea is for you to share your food and DRINK. so the food is designed to be some what shareable, and to go really well with alcohol :) I am personally NOT a big drinker, but I find the food excellent anyway. you go with three other friends, and you will be able to try about 12 platestogether!Authentic, good quality Japanese bar food. my personal favorites are: Onigiri (with tarako and ikura), fluke with ponzu, daikon salad, tofu salad, karaage (fried chicken), onnsen tamago, and beef tongue.a must for a Japanese food fan!
Audrey G.}Boston, MA}2}14}2}-1}5}9/15/2012}I dream about this place sometimes.Since moving to Boston, I've made a number of trips back to New York, and it's almost become a ritual to come here for lunch from Grand Central first thing -- suitcase and baggage in tow. If a friend can't meet me there, it's almost a relief because then I can soak in the sublimity without distractions. I've done dinner here a few times, and the tapas and sake very satisfying each time. The izakaya atmosphere is in full brew then. But the real draw for me is the weekday lunch: the bar is quiet with just a few Japanese businessmen --  and the lunch sets, not offered later, are exquisitely done. Donburis, soba sets, and especially the jewel bako. Everything is cooked perfectly and plated with that thoughtful Japanese delicacy on top of wide leaves. The vegetable tempura is feather light and crisp. The ume rice is spiced and patted into neat cylinders. The squid is rolled with shiso leaf into little roulades of flavor. The bit of yam is soft and sweet, etc. etc. Even the obligatory miso soup is particularly rich. The service is also impeccable. Hot tea is poured alongside water. Steaming hand towels brought out at the beginning and end of the meal, with a little bamboo basket -- are luxurious touches.
Kerrie S.}Brookfield, WI}0}77}5}-1}5}9/14/2012}This place may be hard to find, but it is worth the search!  Amazing.  Came to NYC for the weekend on mission to try a bunch of Izakayas.  This was hands down our favorite.  Everything was delicious, our two favorite:Onigiri w/ Spicy Cod RoeOnsen Tamag:  Soft Boiled Egg with Uni
Lil C.}New York, NY}0}39}0}-1}5}9/13/2012}Service and food are undoubtedly of best quality! Get u taste bud fully satiated.  Ordered Sanshoku Nasu Dengku, Snow crab legs steamed in rice( but u have to wait for 40 min), Agedashi Tofu. They even used Saratoga Sprinkle water! Waitress was so polite and made you feel so welcoming!  Everything is so nice, except for the funny bathrooms.....
Daniel B.}Toronto, Canada}366}347}27}18}5}9/12/2012}Jesus Christ this place is so good.A genuine slice of Japan hidden in the basement of a nondescript building.   Beautifully prepared food.   Perfect service.A unique and authentic experience.
Peter K.}Manhattan, NY}432}602}58}18}4}9/10/2012}This place was great. The food was amazing, although a part of me thinks that I suffered from just a tad too much hype prior to coming here.In terms of the food, we ordered the onsen tamago, the smoked duck, the buta kakuni, and the gyutan all of which were great. My favorite was the Gyutan which literally fell apart at the tips of my chopsticks. The dessert of black sesame creme brulee was also delicious. The flavor so subtle, perfect with the ice cream. The service was so attentive and just perfect. We sat at the bar. The bartender made very helpful suggestions as to which sakes to order. The plum wine was a little too sweet but he had warned us of that.The restrooms all have bidets which, without going into too much detail, were interesting to use.Will definitely be coming back here again and bringing all my out of town friends. A true NY gem.
Wahed K.}Astoria, NY}651}734}1505}18}5}9/6/2012}I was introduced to Sakagura many years ago by a friend who discovered the place completely by accident. Since then, I've been coming here at least once a year. Sakagura is one of  the pioneers that led the explosion of izakaya places in NY. The owners also own Sake Bar Decibel in EV and saying they know a thing or two about sake would be an understatement.Once you have made your way down to the basement and entered the restaurant, you will find yourself looking at the longest sake bar in NY*.  Large bottles of sake line up along the wall behind the bar and that alone should give you a hint that this place means business. The sake choices are extensive and they keep changing. They usually start around $55/60, so they are not cheap but worth the money if you are a sake lover. Last year they had some sake from the Fukushima prefecture that  wouldn't be available anymore due to the nuclear disaster and were raising funds for the victims.As far as the food goes,  the menu seems different every time I am here but thankfully there are some constants. I would recommend:Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly) - Warning: this is a very heavy dish but damn it's good!Gyutan Yawaraka Ni (stewed beef tongue) - They have changed the dish over the years but the essence of it remains the same. The tongue is always perfectly cooked.Hirame Ponzu - Fluke Sashimi served with an awesome citrusy ponzu sauceOnigiri w Spicy Cod Roe (rice balls) - Cuz you always need a rice dish and who doesn't like spicy cod roe?Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg) - I tried this for the first time last week when I came here with two friends and it was amazing. It was topped with uni and salmon roe. Highly recommended for izakaya!* I'm guessing here but I haven't seen a bar as long as Sakagura's in any of the izakaya places in NY.
Caitlin S.}Saint Louis, MO}283}283}37}-1}5}9/5/2012}Good gosh, I loved this place. Well, not the look from the street. There is just one teeny sandwich board sign out front of a generic office building. You go down the stairs to the windowless basement, but there you find a pleasant space. A long bar with tempting sake bottles. Small tables along a wall. No windows, but the food will fulfill all of your senses. The food was incredibly delicious, very reminiscent of Japan and arrived quickly at my table. Not a single complaint. I got the combo of eel donburi and soba. Yum yum yum! I so wish this place were in my backyard so I could go again and again. I do wish the staff were quicker about refiling the tea cups, but all in all they were fine. The food is incredible and should be enough to entice you to visit. Doo it!
Kevin C.}New York, NY}150}56}6}-1}5}9/5/2012}At first, I was a bit thrown off by its awkward, unassuming entrance, but don't be alarmed.  The restaurant certainly maintains its utmost reputation with a plethora of amazing entres to choose from.  Try their Pork Belly, Fluke Sashimi, and Soft Boiled Egg soup.
Justine L.}San Francisco, CA}131}131}71}-1}4}8/31/2012}The service:  Extremely friendly and helpful waitstaff. 5 stars.The food:Sake - We couldn't decide what to drink so the waitress was more than happy to give her 2 cents on the sake.  We were pleased.Fluke carpaccio - " Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe, and Shiso Leaf.  "AMAZING.  It's a shame that this was the first dish that came out because everything that came after this were completely overshadowed. 10 stars.Onsen Tamago - Soft boiled egg w/ uni in cold dashi.  5 stars.Grilled fish - This was off of their specials of the day menu.  I don't remember what kind of fish it was.  It was simply seasoned with some salt and a light dipping sauce.  Simple but delicious.  4 stars.Karage - Fried chicken.  Nothing special.  2 stars.Buta Kakuni - "Sakagura's Special" Gelatinous soft pork belly in a warm dashi broth.  The pork completely fell apart.  So good!  5 stars.Kama Roast - Duck wrapped around scallions.  It was ok.  I would not get this again.    3 stars.Gyutan Yawaraka Ni - Beef tongue stew - The menu didn't describe this dish other than stating it was beef tongue so I thought this was going to be a bbq dish.  It was actually a stew.  It was delicious and very filling and reminded me of Korean galbi jjim.  However I wouldn't get this again.  It would be great as an entree for 1 person but for me, if I am going to come to a restaurant like this, I want to try a bunch of small plates instead of eating 1 big entree.  3 stars.Onigiri wrapped w/ mackerel - So simple but so good.  5 stars.Black sesame creme brulee with ice cream - 5 stars.The cost:You get what you pay for!  I expected the bill to be $200+ but it came out to about $120.Overall:  I will come back!  Everyone should try it.
Lilly L.}Atlanta, GA}4}40}4}-1}4}8/27/2012}We had a 9:00 reservation, so by that time we were all very hungry.  We sat down and ordered 10 items or more.  I was impressed by the items ordered from their "specials" menu.  From their main menu, the agedashi tofu and the fried mash potato donuts were awesome.  We ordered hot sake, medium priced, and it was really good.  Best sake I've had, granted I haven't had much.  We had dessert special which was mango pudding, very good.  Overall seems like a really good restaurant for authentic non-sushi Japanese food.
Leslie D.}New York, NY}1583}657}1222}-1}4}8/27/2012}Sakagura: Underground, magical entrance to Japan hidden near Grand Central? It might as well be.I don't even remember how we came about this traditional Japanese restaurant very late on Saturday night... but it was highly amusing to me to discover that Sakagura is in the basement of my old language class building in Midtown. Of all the buildings in the area, I was not expecting a secret subterranean restaurant in this one filled with bamboo decor, dim lighting and Japanese people furiously cooking away. What a surprise!I came here for a continuation of sake drinking and eating with two friends. I made no decisions whatsover regarding the choice of fare which was fine with me; I left everything up to them as I didn't care either way. Everything we ate and drank was excellent, so good job boys. I remember there was a large bottle of cold sake immersed in ice bucket filled with fresh flowers. I remember there was black and red roe covering a dish of who knows what that I could not have enough of. I remember there was scrumptiously salty uni which I had never eaten in such large quantities before. I remember there was hot and juicy beef tongue stewed in a bowl of miso that just melted in your mouth on impact. Other than that, you got me; that's all I needed to remember. I am making a mental note for myself to come back here during more normal hours to take another look at their menu. If you do choose to find the entrance and descend the stairs, prepare to be transported and have no cell phone service.
Christopher C.}Denver, CO}415}1513}295}18}5}8/26/2012}Maybe it was the Old Fashions, Beer and Sake much earlier in the night, but this place was top notch. The location is just strange but when you walk down the stairs and enter...you know you are going to experience something amazing.The two things that stood out for me was the ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold SoupAnd the most spectacular dish of the night, the GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI :  Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms.I will be coming back soon to this place hopefully very soon. Thanks again to my dining partners which made the night grand.
Joann L.}Paris, France}0}18}6}-1}4}8/24/2012}Located on the B1 floor, this place was a little hard to find at first, but as soon as I stepped inside the restaurant I really felt like I had been transported to an izakaya in Japan; despite being in the basement, they did a great job decorating, and the ambiance was really nice. I went for lunch and got the lunch set, which included soba and a half-size tendon, as well as a pickled side dish and mugi tea. The food was delicious and tasted like proper Japanese cuisine, much better than some of the failed attempts by some of the other 'Japanese' restaurants I've visited in the past. The prices for the lunch menu were reasonable, considering I got a lot of good food. The service was very courteous and patiently answered questions, despite clearly being busy during the lunch-time rush. I'm not a big sake fan, so I didn't try any of the sake. I don't think I would eat dinner here or come here to drink, based on the evening prices. If you're a fan of Japanese alcohol, it might be worth it, though, as it looks like they have a huge selection. I would recommend making a reservation (for either lunch or dinner), because it is very crowded during mealtime rush hours. I didn't make a reservation for lunch, so my party had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but the bar had seats available the entire time I was there.
Kathryn A.}Greenwich, CT}5}17}0}-1}5}8/24/2012}I have taken several people here on many different occasions and the consensus each time is the same - Sakagura is sooooo good. The sake list is vast - really, something for everyone. The food is delicious. Try the maguro yamakake - tuna sashimi with grated mountain yams. Sakagura has an authentic Japanese menu that is consistently great. Love the atmosphere too.
Karen B.}Glen Cove, NY}32}128}1}-1}4}8/19/2012}Every dish we ordered was delicious and exquisitely presented.  One MUST try the black sesame creme brulee
Yili L.}Manhattan, NY}0}7}0}-1}5}8/16/2012}I keep forgetting that I haven't reviewed Sakagura on Yelp yet.  I've been going there since 2007 and it has stayed consistently at the top of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  I've tried about everything on their menu, including the natto.  While there are definitely dishes that I'm not fond of, it's only because the dish isn't to my taste and not because of any deficiency in the quality/prep/presentation.  The space is also excellent.  As their specialty, the sake selection is exhaustive and they definitely satisfy my preference for junmai-ginjo sakes.  Really, everything here is delicious.  And I always end with the black sesame creme brulee. Drooling a bit here as I'm writing this.
Jenn S.}Point Lookout, NY}514}736}1260}18}5}8/15/2012}Great underground place. I like how the menu offers selections not usually seen in japanese restaurants. The hostess always says you have 1 1/2 hours at your table for your reservation but I've definitely stayed longer and never been harassed to get up and leave.Staff is very attentive and yet unobtrusive.
Su N.}New York, NY}36}21}0}-1}5}8/15/2012}what a cute underground joint. we had a choice to sit at the table but opted for the bar instead, it was a more fun atmosphere especially with the different sake bottles in the back. our waiter was super friendly and helpful. we ordered the roasted duck, black cod, deep fried pork, Agedashi Tofu and topped it off with the black sesame creme brulee. i'm not a big sake fan but how can i not drink sake here, we shared a carafe. my friend has been to the sake tastings they hold here and said it's good. they hold it the back room and have around 10-15 sakes to try and they bring out some nibbles throughout.i would come back again to try out the other dishes!
Stacey I.}Rockville Centre, NY}0}13}0}-1}4}8/14/2012}Fun sake bar. Very nice decor. Located underground- no windows, but you won't miss that. It feels very authentic to me (I have been to Tokyo - but only for a few days- so I am not an expert but it reminds me of places in Tokyo that I had seen and been to). The food is very authentic and if you are a picky eater it is best to maybe see if you could see a menu first - or just go there to drink sake! The food is fun but adventurous for a person used to the more typical sushi restaurants (i.e. 7/8 pieces of sushi and a tuna roll for a typical dish). The same owners own Decibel downtown for the grungier version of this place. Since I moved to Nassau County it has been a while since I have been back to either- but thinking I should get there at some point again soon! :)
Azza K.}New Rochelle, NY}45}9}0}-1}5}8/5/2012}THE BEST Japanese I keep running back to for more. Am a great fan of many of their dishes, but the one that is absolutely unlike anything else is their tofu salad.  It is getting increasingly difficult to be able to find a table without reservations though in spite of years of being a client. Great pity, but the food is worth the trouble of a reservation (they take a message and get back to you).
Lucy X.}Washington, DC}56}226}302}-1}3}8/2/2012}This is a rather average Japanese restaurant in NYC. We tried the Tuna Tartar for appetizer, Pork Belly, Soba, and for dessert, the Chocolate cake. The Tuna Tartar was very pretty and fresh, I loved this one! The pork belly was outrageously fatty, I've never encountered anything like it before. Almost a little too much for me, but at least it was well prepared. The Soba wasn't your average buckwheat noodle, but cold ramen?? It was pretty bad... But thank god for the dessert, chocolate pudding cake, with a side of ice cream and raspberry sauce, ended the dinner well. They also have a HUGE selection of sake, and I enjoyed it. Try their recommended ones!
Laura S.}Manhattan, NY}1}65}1}-1}5}7/27/2012}This place was great! We passed it and had to go back looking for the entrance, but eventually found it! You must make a reservation for this place, else you have a very small chance of getting a table. The food here is excellent and authentic, yet sophisticated. Uni soba and salmon roe over rice is amazing!! I'm not a huge fan of uni, but it was soo good! The salmon was so buttery and creamy..delicious! The only think is that the portions are on the smaller side, but definitely worth it if you have the money to spend. We also got the black sesame creme boule which was great! Who would have though of black sesame (although it did look the black sesame creme by itself looked unappetizing, it tasted great)? Very creative!! I can't wait to come back and try more dishes here!
Mia W.}Cupertino, CA}19}64}12}-1}5}7/24/2012}Came here with friends and it was such a fantastic experience.  One of my friends ordered a delicious yet reasonably priced bottle of sake. then he ordered 2 more.Started with a sea urchin salmon roe soup, wow, tall about a fantastic start!!Enoki wrapped in cold duck slicesPork belly...braised perfectly in brothSeaweed salad dressing excellent Black cod was so good we had 3 ordersSnow crab legs steamed in rice, subtleBeef short ribs texture was fall off th boneSteak on hot stone smelled divine....last but not leastSea urchin soba noodles were heavenlyBlack sesame ice cream, can't go wrongFood, drinks, and service  were very very excellent. Very deserving of 5 stars.
Melissa C.}Seattle, WA}111}610}230}18}4}7/20/2012}The sake oyako don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice) is really great here and very artistically presented. I love how the salmon roe would burst in my mouth with flavor. I also enjoyed the agedashi tofu. We had some crab dish over rice, which I think might have been a special. It was delicious!What really stood out here were the desserts. The chocolate souffle was outstanding and perfectly moist. My sister really loved the black sesame creme brulee. Even if you're full, definitely order the desserts here!
Sumito A.}Manhattan, NY}299}418}1032}-1}4}7/20/2012}Get to the Chase:Pros:1) Fantastic individual morsels of food, that melt in your mouth, explode with deliciousness, or hit the spot you been craving for all week2) Authentic Japanese cuisine and does the food justice3) Quaint, classy, and fun ambience4) Very courteous staff, and always attentive to your needs5) AWESOME BATHROOM! LIKE FOSHO...it's kind of like hidden in this bamboo-esque wall, and inside is dim-lit like a romantic movie scene (so you're totally in the zone to calmly let yourself go and clean yourself up), and the toilet is like one of those japanese electric ones!!!!! hello bidet? (could'nt find that part)Cons:1) Took off one star, because I left hungry and because my wallet was empty....I got hoodwinked yo! Usually if you go with a bloody group of 12 the costs should go down and the food should be plenty....but it's the opposite. We had 6 bottles of sake though...that might've done it too...but still I literally had 1 sushi and that's it....and spent $125+tip O_O
Candice B.}San Francisco, CA}104}565}0}-1}4}7/20/2012}The last thing you want to do on vacation is to hear suits next to you talk about "expanding business" and "increasing revenue." But the food is worth the nuance that comes with lunching around this area. I got the daily special of a bowl of soba noodles bathed in uni soup with uni on top. I was completely uni-ed out by the end, but in a good way.   Everything looked good on the menu but I was really happy to have chosen this.
Jenny H.}Baltimore, MD}527}838}673}18}4}7/16/2012}I came here for lunch with a group of 6 and it was an awesome place for lunch!!  Super authentic, lots of Japanese people eating there, and all the decor and menu options seemed like the real deal.I got their duck curry udon (Kamo Curry Numban), and the duck was REALLY GOOD!!!  Super moist and flavorful with the right amount of fat.  I also ordered the sesame spinach salad (Gomaae), which was SO good- I would order 5 of these and eat them all at once, it's cold boiled spinach tossed in this light sesame dressing- delicious!!My colleagues got their vegetable udon which they didn't like as much as mine.  It's spacious and they had quick service.  Great place to check out if you're in the area!
Michelle T.}New York, NY}319}971}1072}18}5}7/16/2012}There really isn't much more that I can add to the hundreds of wonderful reviews other Yelpers have already left this great restaurant. I can, however, give some in sight to the level of demand. I had called to make a reservation for two a week beforehand for a Friday night dinner for two at 6pm. The woman on the other end of the line told me that the table was already booked for 8:30pm and we would need to give it back then. I was fine with that considering how we're both fast eaters. When we arrived, they were just opening but I noticed that every single table had a 'reserved' sign on top of it - even the bar seats. When the boyfriend and I left at around 8pm, a couple walked in and asked for a table. When they told the hostess that they did not have a reservation and asked if the wait was long, the hostess didn't even bother to answer. It's Sakagura at 8pm. Do you think the wait is long? Now onto the food - here are some of my must-haves: 1. Salmon Don - I don't usually like salmon roe but I gobbled every single last bubble up. 2. Pork Belly - get one order to share, it's not large but it's enough to get a good taste without feeling gross 3. Grilled Cod Fish - very flavorful and very unlike any other grilled cod I've ever tasted
Corn N.}Los Angeles, CA}69}106}1}-1}5}7/13/2012}Came here twice and BOTH times were amazing! First time I came here was in 2006 with 3 dear friends of mine for dinner. One of them is a native Japanese speaker, so he ordered all the food for all four of us. My favorite dish of the night was the otoro. It literally melted in my mouth. The second time I came here was last winter(November 2011). The quality of the food again was excellent. The amount of food that was ordered was overwhelming and I would have thought too much would make us explode and not enjoy it as much. Thankfully I was still able to discern the kamo roast, maguro tartar, buta kakuni, gyutan yawaraka ni, and chawanmushi all made my stomach and eyes happy. I thoroughly enjoy food that chefs put a lot of heart and soul into making pleasant for all of our senses. The service was nice and the atmosphere hasn't changed much since 2006(it's a little dark but otherwise it's nice and clean). Keep up with the great food!
Carl P.}Bronx, NY}0}1}0}-1}3}7/9/2012}I'm a very picky person when it comes to Asian food, fyi. The food wasn't bad but it could have been better. The desserts were great though and I really liked the vibe of the place. Ideal place to go for dinner and a date.
Don C.}Manhattan, NY}5}123}9}-1}5}7/8/2012}This is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. It's very intimate and the food is phenomenal--a revelation. I usually get the kaisen don set for lunch, which is an assortment of sashimi on sushi rice, with some hot or cold soba noodles, and Japanese pickles. And for dinner I always get several small dishes, including the onsen tamago, which is a cold dashi soup with uni, ikura, and a soft-boiled egg. Heaven. I have many other favorites, like the soy-braised cod and the beef tongue. Drinking sake there is a delightful experience, especially if you order the Masu, where the sake is served in a traditional lacquered box. The desserts are also great, which hasn't always been my experience in Japanese restaurants. I especially like the sea salt chocolate sorbet and the black sesame creme brulee. Lunch or dinner will set you back, but it's worth it.
David L.}New York, NY}4}102}0}-1}3}7/7/2012}Finally came here. I wrote in my notes that it was a "pricey upscale japanese stop." I think that sums it up pretty succinctly. But I think at these prices I prefer Yakitori Totto.
Ariel D.}Long Beach, CA}1}20}0}-1}4}7/6/2012}Shady basements in New York City usually lead to: 1. A weird basement store that probably sells more than clothes, if you know what I mean.2. Exactly where your imagination goes to when you read "shady basements."3. Really, really, really good food.This basement actually wasn't shady at all, but, if I have to go downstairs from ground level for my food, my Metal Gear Solid codec alert goes off. But seriously, I am glad that I usually don't take my own advice, because this place was amazing. I came here twice, once with a friend with a friend without a reservation (! don't do this, we waited for over half an hour) and once with my cousin.The food is consistently wonderful, gorgeously plated, and perfectly proportioned. I mean, don't you just hate it when they give you too much rice and not enough of whatever was supposed to be supplying the flavor? Well, that won't ever happen here. The compartments of their rice bowls (especially the sake don) are perfectly measured, every time, from the rice to the sashimi to the roe. It's like happiness in a bowl.
Kelly L.}Seattle, WA}78}206}159}-1}4}6/30/2012}I lived in New York for 4 years and never knew about this place until I moved to Seattle and saw pictures of a friend's friend. The picture that drew me in was of the onsen tamago, uni and ikura in cold dashi. With something as inventive as that (I've been to many Japanese restaurants, worked in 2 and lived in Tokyo for 2 years), I knew I had to try it during my trip visiting NY.A few of my friends who have lived in NY for more than 4 years were all excited to try it since none of them have been there either. It's a little hard to find since it's in the basement of an office building. I was getting giddy as we entered the restaurant. Felt like we were discovering this secret hidden gem.We ordered A LOT of food between the 4 of us and everything was delicious, even the simple dishes, they made to perfection and had a slight twist to it. The seaweed salad was 4 kinds of seaweed. The nasu age came with different types of pastes different from the usual miso.The uni dish that made me want to come in the first place did not disappoint! We each ordered our own! I usually don't like Uni and maybe because I haven't had good uni. It melted like butter in my mouth and did not taste fishy at all.We didn't realize how big the pork belly was. We ordered one for each person and it was definitely way more than we needed. Probably 1 order is more than enough for 2 people.We had this pulled pork dish that was really tasty as well.BTW, if you go to the bathroom, make sure you look above for the doll to figure out if it's the men or women's bathroom! I went into the wrong one without looking!
Yuhe C.}New York, NY}68}150}10}-1}5}6/30/2012Updatedreview}Came here for lunch awhile ago and the food was just as delicious as the first time around. I had the Kaisen Don/Soba set - a warm bowl of fresh rice topped with all sorts of seafood goodies complemented by cold soba and oshinko (pickles). For one, the quality of the sashimi was excellent. The ikura (salmon roe) was especially fresh. I normally don't like to eat ikura because it has such a strong salty and unpleasantly fishy taste. However, the ikura on my Kaisen Don was so light and luscious - mixed with rice, they tasted like pure, unadulterated ocean. Honestly, I've only had fresher fish in Tokyo.I was also shocked by the size of the portions. Based on my previous dinner experience, I thought the lunch portions would be petite but instead, they were huge. Everything was served extra-large, which, if you're hungry, is a very good thing.  Like the time before, this experience was excellent. Sakagura, in my book, you can do no wrong! Yuhe's Suggestions:- If you are starving and on a budget, get the Oyako Don! At $11.50, this gigantic bowl (as big as your head) of tender chicken, buttery eggs, crisp sweet onions and rice is a perfectly hearty meal.-Lunch doesn't seem to be as crowded as dinner. So, if you're dying to try Sakagura but haven't been able to get a good dinner reservation, come for lunch! They also have specials that you can only get during lunch time!
Xinyuan W.}Rochester, NY}36}99}0}-1}4}6/27/2012}loved the steak that you cook on a hot stone, really tender and top quality beef, also got salmon sashimi with salmon roe on rice, thought it was quite good. everything that I tried here was good, but portions are a little small for my taste. I guess I eat a lot.
Erica S.}Manhattan, NY}277}210}26}-1}5}6/26/2012}Amazing!Ordered a variety of dishes - tuna sashimi, chilled tofu, salmon don, doughnuts, poached egg, dumplings, grilled cod, etc.Favorites were the chilled tofu, salmon don and doughnuts! Was less of a fan of the cooked dumplings and cod. Definitely preferred the raw foods!Overall, this place is a great Japanese restaurant in Midtown -- fresh food, great service, varied menu, and reasonably priced!
J C.}Palo Alto, CA}117}150}0}-1}4}6/25/2012}My best friend took me here for the first time and it was marvelous! Love all the dishes that we tried & had a great time there!
tatiana H.}Brooklyn, NY}0}71}11}-1}1}6/24/2012}One star because there was no option for zero star or negative starts.I've been to this place a few times in the past and was not really empresses but was not bad to the point of comment either but this recent trip make me think if I have to go through that, I have to get paid to come here. Not worth it.I read some of the good reviews here and seems like written by Non- Japanese. I am Japanese. Some restaurant, like the one sushi place across the street from this one has excellent reviews but none of my Japanese like. Decor might be nice but you don't eat the wall and this place is totally lacks fundamental things like good services. *NYC sanitation rating is  B. It's been a while since this program started and the restaurants had plenty of time to change the problem and get A as you might have seen. Some take out Chinese that got C now has A. This place still has B. I don't know if NYC agency wants them to grill sashimi to give A but someone does not want to change what government thinks health risk.* Avoid if you are group, they seem to like max 4. Tables arranged that way.We went there group of 6 and when we asked them to be group of 8, the hostess, two waiters needed to gather together to discuss about possibilities. They had huge attitude when they finally moved us to the bigger table but throughout the night, I saw more than 3 tables empty. If they don't want us to be a bigger group, just say it, we even offered them to be split up to 4x4 that attitude was very unnecessary.*food are good but nothing outstanding. Super overpriced. I feel sad that Japanese restaurant w decent food tend to be overpriced and cheap place, you'd only get microwaved dumplings and edamame. SHould be happy medium. I can have this type of food half or 1/3 in Japan but we're ny. I mean, I get how sushi becomes more expensive but some of the food here is like typical Japanese home cooking type which does not have to be that expensive....such as fried tofu, hijiki in a tiny tiny bowel, thin sliced daikon salad w mayo  etc. Nothing spectacular at all. *Wat staff is horrible We have two wait staff here and there but both them had huge attitude. They might have misunderstood being arrogant and unfriendly would make them look like stoic  old school male waiters? I asked "Have you tried this sake" "yes. I tried them all " "Then? how is it?" "This is better, pointing other one without specific reasoning besides that one was much more expensive."  Another occasion, as asked them to bring one more glass, the waiter asked "Just one more? one, right ?" His tone of voice was "Are you definitely sure that you only need one more? I am not feeling like I am going to make one more trip to bring another glass, it's got to be the last one!!!" Seriously, No doubt this is the worst service that I ever had.  I wanted to give least tip but since it was already big group, they already added 20% tip, they did not deserve.I would NRVER EVER go back to this place.  I would only recommend this place if you want to impressed with the decor which I don't think its such a big deal and wanted to be treated second class citizen by their waiters, go ahead!
Wells H.}Manhattan, NY}69}41}0}-1}4}6/23/2012}The only reason that I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is the service. Mind you, there was nothing wrong with the service but it just wasn't spectacular. The food was AMAAZZZINNGGGGG. Everything was cooked to perfection. Out of the 10 or so dishes that we all ordered (6 of us, the dishes are small, like tapas style); there was literally not one dish that i did not enjoy or thought could have been improved.The place is a little expensive so i wouldn't go on the regular, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND it for special occasions or if you just ball out like that haha. It's also a true Sake bar. I'm not a connoisseur of sake but one of the people I was with is and said hes never seen such a comprehensive list and some of the really quality Sakes were cheaper at Sakagura than in the stores!
Irene S.}New York, NY}15}77}26}-1}4}6/22/2012}Sizzling hot outside today, so what could be better than a bowl of ice cold, handmade soba and a buckwheat beer in a subterranean retreat? Nothing, except for the pristine sashimi dabbed with fresh grated wasabi. Sakagura is known for its extensive sake collection and limited edition fresh soba, but all the food is appealing, and I love the cavernous room, which is decorated like a Kurosawa feudal Japan movie set.Go anytime, but the ample lunch specials (which all comes with a side of soba) are a great value at $11.50. The frequent diner point system has a sadistic twist because you don't get a stamp unless you spend $12, but a beer or dessert will put you over the limit.
Minnie M.}London, United Kingdom}146}310}31}-1}4}6/21/2012}43rd between 2nd and 3rd has become my favorite block. Sakagura, Soba Totto, Sushi Yasuda make a holy trinity of amazing Japanese restaurants, brought to you by the letter S.Sakagura is a lovely, cavernous restaurant, and it quite literally feels like a cave once you start spelunking down the series of stairs underground and losing your AT&T reception on the way.  My brother and I made last minute reservations on a Monday, and they had a 7:15 pm availability at the bar.  We arrived ravenous and left with satiated appetites, full but comfortably so, ordering:HIYAYAKKO :  Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes  $5.00 (solid, nothing extraordinary)IKA SHIOKARA :  Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade  $5.00 (warning: this was good but very salty)ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup  $9.00 (the waiter recommended we each get one, but the uni was decent enough of a serving to be shared)SEAWEED SALAD :  Assortment of Seaweed Topped with a choice of Citrus Vinaigarette OR Sesame  $8.00 (the sesame dressing is incredible)SANMA ONIGIRI :  Cooked Rice Balls with Shiitake Mushroom, Pickled Radish and Mountain Vegetables Wrapped with a Whole Baked Pike Mackerel [3pcs]  $10.00 (this was wonderful-crispy rice balls wrapped in crispy mackerel)UNI SOBA $22 (honestly loved this more than the Uni Soba at Soba Totto and Soba Ya- the broth sets it apart from the rest)SESAME CRÈME BRULEE $9 (solid, nothing extraordinary)Like most Izakaya places, Sakagura is a great place to try a little bit of everything, and I will definitely come back to work my drunken way through the extensive sake menu.
Tina Y.}WALL STREET, NY}229}268}2984}-1}5}6/20/2012}This place is awesome! You would never know there is a beautiful restaurant hidden in the basement of an office building.  This place has a wide variety of sake, so don't miss out!  Had the salmon and ikura don,  a bunch of grilled veggies and meat.  Left the place stuffed and slightly tipsy. LOL.
Jo K.}New York, NY}267}494}313}18}4}6/19/2012Updatedreview}I came here for dinner 3 more times and it's amazing how much I love this place now. I think my last review was just based on a lunch experience I had here but now it's become one of my favorite japanese places. Pork belly was divine. Tuna tartar was really good. Even the tofu salad was pretty awesome. Cod was okay but the uni soba was by far my favorite. One thing to mention was the service was a little questionable. We were confused about the sake bottle sizes and she wasn't really good at explaining anything. Then she brought us this tiny little half bottle but we were expecting a large bottle and it turned out to be 90 dollars on the check. Each person barely got a shot out of it. I guess that would be my only complaint.
Edward W.}New York, NY}357}1236}2160}18}4}6/17/2012}I came to New York on vacation, and my friend brought me to this restaurant. I cannot thank him enough for bringing me. The sake oyako don ($16) is AMAZING. The salmon sashimi is the best I've ever tasted, and the restaurant is located underground in the middle of New York City, which makes the dining experience even more awesome. The salmon roe is a lot larger than the one you normally find in sushi so it packs a little surprise every time you bite into it. The presentation is quite nice also. The portions are definitely a lot smaller, but I would recommend this place to people who enjoy high quality food and are willing to pay for it.
grace g.}Chicago, IL}0}9}0}-1}4}6/14/2012}Good as usual.Can't never go wrong if ordered the mash potato, pork belly, ohzen tamago.I also found the beef tongue was delicious but it was a little bit salty.The seasonal dish grill whole sweet fish was not that good though.
Shoko O.}Los Angeles, CA}34}47}0}-1}4}6/14/2012}This place is darn pricey, but man was it good.We had some of their appetizers, like carpaccios and salads, also tsukune. We had their seafood donburi at the end with ikura and salmon. Their ikura was DELICIOUS! Sooo good! I think it was coated in some special soy-sauce like sauce to add flavor, but whatever it was, it was great! I can't go to these places without parents who pay for the meal... but man this place rocked. The atmosphere is also very cool. Saka-gura means "in the cave/den of sakes" and they live up to the name. Huge barrel-like objects are in the den-like restaurant to recreate what a traditional, sake-brewing den looks like in Japan.Overall a good experience here!
Bentobox S.}Quogue, NY}299}119}19}-1}5}6/12/2012}Feels like Tokyo and all was great. Super cool hidden spot.
Pamela S.}Brooklyn, NY}53}177}0}-1}4}6/12/2012Updatedreview}Had to downgrade Sakagura.  Went a couple weeks ago for lunch again, and they rushed my dining companion and I like crazy even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant.  Granted, the food was great (we both got the bento, and split the green tea ice cream for dessert, I had sake my companion had beer) the service could have been better.  I understand they were probably in a hurry to have their break and get ready for their dinner service, however, with two people just sitting and chatting (like the other two tables) was it that necessary to rush us?  I'll be hesitant to go back to Sakagura for a leisurely/relaxed/unrushed lunch.  I totally dug their rice balls/rolls that came with the bento box.
Ian S.}Glen Ridge, NJ}11}19}0}-1}4}6/7/2012}Impossible to find - but worth it. The food is very good, although i prefer Soba Totto next store when it comes to straight Soba.  You usually dont need a reso for lunch if you get there at noon.
Nance H.}Manhattan, NY}285}249}3}-1}4}6/5/2012}When you enter this restaurant, it feels very calm and relaxing. This is a nice short getaway from the busy Manhattan lifestyle for lunch. Although the lunch "specials" are a bit pricey, the food is absolutely delicious, and authentic and quality Japanese food.
Dina L.}New York, NY}93}87}3}-1}5}6/4/2012}Delicious food, abundant sake and an exasperatingly hidden location in an office building that makes you gasp when you descend into a sexy cavernous space. I have tried several izakayas in the city and this one is by far the best in terms of menu variety, unusual offerings and quality of food. There were no bad dishes, just good and better ones.Some of the highlightsONSEN TAMAGO - soft boiled egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - if the ingredients  alone are not enough to make you salivate then maybe it's not for you. For fans of sea urchin, it's a briny symphonyDAIKON SALAD - surprisingly simple and deliciousGYUTAN YAWARAKA NI - Beef tongue in miso- I am not a fan of beef tongue but this was nothing like any beef tongue I had- a velvet texture of a filet mignon with much more gaminess and flavor
Brian V.}Santa Ana, CA}228}2}0}-1}4}5/30/2012}The food was great! Sea urchin soba noodles were fantastic. Everyone but out waiter was awesome and kind, even the guests were nice too. Overall a great experience and an awesome place to be in. Decorated very well.
Ivan C.}Pasadena, CA}2}15}0}-1}5}5/30/2012}Best izakaya in NYC, awesome menu great sakes
Tiffany D.}Los Angeles, CA}1517}972}1439}18}4}5/30/2012}Had a great lunch time tasting menu here on my visit to NY to see my boo. Walked in around 1:30 and had a 5 minute wait. They are staring a new early-lunch club, where you get perks for eating before noon...not a bad way to save some cash $$!The food was very good, but not mind-blowingly memorable. Our $30 tasting menu included 4 courses, which i thought was a decent deal for NY! We left very full!Course 1: Sashimi platter was very good. Fresh pieces, good quality cuts of fish. Decent offering.Course 2: Udon with seaweed on top. Great mix of flavors, couldn't stop eating it.Course 3: 3 tiers, including tempura veggies and shrimp, seared butterfish with lotus root, and teriyaki steak in a sweet sauce. The steak was delicious. Definitely the best thing I had the entire lunch. Tempura was crisp and perfectly fried, without being soggy. Butterfish was strong flavored outside, but very good.Course 4: Dessert. We opted for the chocolate souffle with the raspberry sauce and ice cream. Delish but suuuuper decadent!
Kristie C.}Palo Alto, CA}588}927}1162}18}4}5/30/2012}Food was OK, a bit too oily for me:- Eggplant w/miso (deepfried)- Grilled cod in sweet soy (also very oily)- Tuna Tartar w/caviar (wasn't very fresh, lots of tendons + fishy)-  Chawanmushi ** THIS was good, small victories**Overwhelming sake selection.Cool, tucked away little japanese place -- seems like you probably should make a reservation. Quiet but loud enough for both a date spot or just a few friends. Very authentic.Overall would come back, probably more for snacks + sake than dinner though
Fabian W.}London, United Kingdom}0}16}0}-1}5}5/28/2012}A stunningly good Japanase place. I am not an expert on Japanese food but it seems very authentic (about half of the guests were Japanese, yesterday) and the sake collection is also very nice (if you have not yet had sake with Japanese food this is the place to do it!)They do "tapas-style" dishes and my favorite dishes were a grilled squid and a delicious wrap of prawns and algues.
Irina B.}Atlanta, GA}47}197}1}18}5}5/22/2012}This was amazing. Really, not a single complaint from a table of five people with VERY different standards and opinions.We tried a lot of the items on the menu, and literally everything was outstanding. The items that got the most praise from my group were:Braised pork bellyCreme bruleeKobe beefSashimi samplerFried veggies plateEverything else was outstanding as well. I could write a lot more about each thing we ordered, but I only can use the same "delicious" and "amazing" adjectives for each item. Bottom line - check it out. You won't regret it.
Joanna T.}Manhattan, NY}68}62}0}-1}5}5/18/2012}This place is great!  My cousin brought my parents and me here when we were visiting, and we were curious as to where she was meeting us.  When you look for this restaurant, you find yourself walking into this apartment/office building thing, then into the basement.  Strange location, but it's kind of nice in that hidden gem kind of way.The food was amazing, and the sake collection was even better.  Each different type of sake you get comes out in a different bottle with different sake glasses, and it was so much fun just to see what type of beautiful glassware they would bring out next.  we got the:Gindara Yuan Yaki ($10) - very yummy if you like cod!Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku ($12) - all of the different misos were great...pretty small portions for what you're paying (especially just for eggplants)Homemade Nihachi Soba ($12) - with fresh wasabi :)Sanma Onigiri ($10) - how does anybody not like onigiri?Tori karaage ($8) - pretty much the same as other japanese restaurants' KaraageHirame Ponzu ($9)Saikoro Steak ($12) - very yummy and if you feel like eating something more substantial this feels very filling.I forget which sake we got, but I think our waitress was spot-on with the recommendations and you can't go wrong with any of them.  Our desserts:Black Sesame Creme Brulee ($9) - very interesting and delicious. creamy with a nice touch of sesameSake Manju ($6) - I couldn't really tell any difference from the "Sake Lees Bun stuffed with Red beans" to any other red bean bao that you get at dim sum, but it was delicious nonetheless.
Li L.}San Francisco, CA}222}45}5}-1}4}5/16/2012}Came here with some friends after hearing about the "hidden" nature of the venue.tried calling to get reservations but no one picked up =(. i tried amex concierge and got a table for 8:30. thank you amex!! had a bottle of junmai ginjo sake that the waiter recommended (light and floral) it was good. they have a massive selection.I can't say the food was memorable - everything was good but not great. small izakayatype plates. I would come back purely for the sake and ambiance. oh yea it was pricey.
Monica M.}Danbury, CT}75}167}0}-1}4}5/16/2012}My boyfriend loves Japanese cuisine so I wanted to take him somewhere special and Sakagura was my top choice.  I'm sure other Yelpers have pointed this out but the restaurant is hidden in the basement of an office building.  Reservations are an absolute MUST.  They have so many tapas to choose from and it can be quite overwhelming so we basically ordered everything off the specials menu.  I am by no means a sake connoisseur but our waiter was so he selected sakes based on our preference.   Unfortunately, the tapas and sake come with a hefty price tag.  The service is superb and the ambiance is quite intimate so I will be a loyal customer but only if my bank account allows it.
Jennifer B.}Post Falls, ID}4}47}0}-1}4}5/11/2012}Loved this restaurant.  A bit pricy, but fresh food and large menu.  The restaurant is in a basement with a very nice ambiance.  Good sashimi and other small plates as well.  The drinks overpriced even by NY standards.  There is noodle house next door that has a cute lounge, that I would recommended stopping by for happy hour.  Great Lychee martinis!
Tompy F.}Manhattan, NY}2}121}1}-1}4}5/8/2012}Great variety of well-prepared foods and a selection of Sake to match.
Eva G.}New York, NY}144}688}465}-1}5}5/7/2012}I've been here maybe 4-5 times, and have always assumed I had already given it a spectacular review. Usually, the more you've been to a restaurant, the less you glorify it, but Sakagura has always upheld a certain standard. Every time I walk in, either all the tables are occupied, or the tables are reserved (I'd say 75% of them are marked, even if you do a walk-in on a weekday at the opening time of 11:30am). As a restaurant, hidden it is, but a secret it is no more.The surprising thing about it is, the prices are unreasonably reasonable. Our favorite items to order:Hirame Ponzu ($9): fluke sashimi with chives and diakon in a citrus vinaigrette; so refreshing!Buta Kakuni ($5): braised pork belly, juicy and tender, enough to share between 2 people. I've never seen it this cheap.Maguro Tartar ($16): tuna steeped in yuzu, very good.Bara Chirashi Don ($11.50 on the daily soba set lunch special menu, limited to availability): what an insane deal for this filling set!Other great dishes:Tori Karaage ($8): fried chicken, best when dipped in that daikon/ponzu mix from other dishes! We actually liked the fried pork more due to the meat being more tender.Tori Tsukune ($6): these chicken meatballs in teriyaki sauce weren't amazing, but it's been a tradition of ours to order.Gindara Yuan Yaki ($10): grilled cod in sweet soy sauce, but has a savory kick to balance out.A great selection of sake too; if that's your main focus, you need to sit at the bar. They offer tasting specials too. Fancy glassware and presentation to keep stuffs cold.
Julie S.}Miami, FL}64}202}3}-1}5}5/6/2012}Wow - comparable only to Kyo Ya.  Exquisite Japanese cuisine.  Every time I dine at a restaurant like this, my resolve is confirmed as to why Japanese is my favorite food of all time.  Onsen tomago - softboiled egg in cold soup with sea urchin - outstanding, must have.  Maguro yamakake - tuna with yam - interesting, refreshing, good.  Uzaku - eel and seaweed - tender, flavorful, excellent.  Seaweed salad - 4 types of seaweed, a little different than the usual, beautiful.  Buta kakuni - pork belly - fantastic lick-your-lips fatty goodness.  Grilled eggplant with three types of miso - absolutely delicious and surprisingly one of our favorite selections.  Special of day - grilled sweet fish with sea salt - gorgeous but very little actual fish... hehe.  Dessert: black sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream - outstanding in flavor.  Everything amazing (other than odd location), must break my rule to not eat at the same place twice - will certainly come back again someday.
Naomi S.}ASTORIA, NY}0}33}0}-1}5}4/29/2012}The food at this place is effing awesome. I love Japanese fried food - karaage (fried chicken), agedashidofu (fried tofu in broth), and nasu dengaku (fried eggplant with miso sauce). All of these were cooked perfectly, just as you'd find them in Japan. I also liked that they brought out the dishes one by one instead of just dumping a whole bunch of plates on the table, as crappy izakayas are wont to do. If only they had oshinko (assorted picked vegetables) and okonomiyaki (the pancake dish), the menu would be truly complete.
Lily P.}San Francisco, CA}1248}987}3255}18}5}4/25/2012}I love this place. If you need to go somewhere via random office building and into the basement and it's always full?!?! def worth itUmi soba was great refreshing not too heavy worth splitting with someone else so you can get other food, assorted tuna over rice with roe was great, the tuna tartar with the 2 different types of egg with cucumber is that I get all the time, and also the eel (3rd page of menu first item) was very good. The pork belly which is $5 per person is a huge fatty piece of pork belly in a soupy texture. They have reg soba there which was pretty good, the eggplant with miso was amazing sauces (one of them is a caramelized piece of heaven). The beef cooked on a hot stone wasn't really worth it. The yuzu cocktails was amazing... I would go back everyday if I could.Desserts remind me of spot where its not too sweet but good mix of black sesame, green tea, sorbet, and etc items.
Madhuri I.}New York, NY}290}272}0}-1}4}4/24/2012}If there's one city in the world where a large space in the basement of what looks like a nondescript office building is too crowded to seat you, on what feels like the coldest day of the year (and really everyone should be in their pajamas under the covers), it's New York.In any case though, I thought I could waltz in without a reservation at Sakagura. A restaurant with 533 reviews. How naive.We did have a little bit of a wait to be seated, but ours was a small party of 2 and it wasn't too bad. My husband and I had already munched on an early dinner (partly due to the lack of vegetarian options here) and so ended up doing what we usually do at great restaurants with limited vegetarian options. Drinks + Dessert. My favourite parts of any meal anyway!We shared a couple of different kinds of sake between the two of us, and I found that our server's recommendation was on point. They do have an extensive list of sake so colour me suitably impressed at him knowing that like the back of his hand.The food at Sakagura, in all its limited vegetarian friendliness, is actually quite tasty. Undeterred by minor facts like we'd already eaten dinner, we went ahead and ordered a few appetizers to share anyway. Let's call it.. for the sake of research, hmm? The eggplant with three different kinds of miso(red, spinach and egg yolk) was delicate, understated and grilled perfectly. We also shared the seaweed salad with the citrus vinaigrette.The black sesame creme brulee was certainly interesting, and I might order it another day when I'm in the mood for something different, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the texture itself. Owing to the addition of sesame, the custard had taken a grainy form, though I loved the texture of the delicate caramel, which shattered upon the slightest little tap of my spoon. We also got the chocolate souffle, which was predictably tasty.We also got to live through the first date of the couple that was seated by us. Thanks for being so loud, it was quite the entertainment. We have a bet on how long it will last for you two but sadly we may never find out.
jenna h.}Manhattan, NY}0}5}0}-1}5}4/15/2012}mmmmm....lots of delicious vegetarian options, and the fish was YUMMMM....mmm......I just ate there last night, and already made plans with my husband to go back for my birthday dinner.  Seriously delicious food. The eggplants were amazing, as was the salmon and roe on rice.  Really Really liked everything I tried though.  Can't wait to go back!
Austin V.}New York, NY}46}376}125}-1}5}4/10/2012}I've avoided writing a review for long enough... I've been going to Sakagura now for over 5 years now.  Over all they are one of my top 10 restaurants of NY because of consistency, service, alcohol (sake) selection, ambiance (true izakaya hideaway) and most of all food.   I always recommend them with this preface in mine:  this is not a sushi "joint", they don't do rolls, and don't do sake bombs of any kind here.  This is solid Japanese food and drink for the connoisseur. Try something new and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Enjoy
Lyn C.}San Francisco, CA}118}1185}22}18}4}4/8/2012}Ate dinner here by recommendation of my homie Anthony Bourdain.  Called ahead and made reservations in advance.  Very nice ambiance and attentive service.  It was kinda hard to decide at first because there were no pictures or phone service to check yelp. We had to pick food the old school way!!  Thankfully everything we had was great and presented nicely.  Pork belly- We each got one, which probably filled us up the mostDuck wrapped around scallions-  Duh, I ordered duck!! This (and the pork belly) were my favAgedashi tofuMashed potato puffs- more batter than potato Tuna sashimi with bean curd-  could have done without the bean curd.  Tuna was goodTuna tartareWagyu beefShrimp balls-  well, more like shrimp cubes.  Way better than the dim sum kind.Free range chickenChocolate soufflé- I'm not a fan of chocolate but this was really goodThanks for the tip, Tony...you always come through for me!!
Sherry C.}Forest Hills, NY}13}14}1}-1}5}4/6/2012}So far my favorite Japanese restaurant in NYC! Food was better than expected. Very traditional, spot-on Japanese flavors. Everything we ordered was excellent and full of umami:ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold SoupMAGURO TARTARGINDARA YUAN YAKI :  Cod in Sweet Soy Sauce - Highly recommendedGYUTAN YAWARAKA NI :  Beef Tongue - Highly recommendedSAKE OYAKO DON: the salmon was really fatty and oily (in a good way)I also highly recommend a BEEF FILET dish that I can't find on their website now. It's pieces of high quality beef cooked on a hot stone. It was probably the most memorable dish of the night.We also had the SESAME CREAM BRULEE to finish the meal.Their Sake selections were excellent. We got two carafes of different kinds of Sake (sweet/dry) and they were both delicious. Our server was attentive and gave good food recommendations.
ReAnna W.}Philadelphia, PA}2}1}0}-1}3}4/6/2012}I was really looking forward to having dinner here with my beau while escaping one city for another, but unfortunately that wasn't so.  Our waitress rushed us into ordering after coming over to us about 5 times within 5 minutes.  Without any time to discuss what we would like to order to share a la family style, we blindly ordered uni over soba noodles w/uni broth (special for the evening), seaweed salad w/sesame dressing, maguro yamakake, jidori shioraki, buta kakuni and ended with the black sesame creme brulee.  The uni soba noodles were fantastic, but then again, uni on anything makes it 500x better, even if it were ice cream. The other dishes were well prepared but didn't make me have a "when I'm back in NYC, I have to come back here" moment.
Kristina R.}Chicago, IL}59}32}0}-1}5}4/4/2012}The best Sushi lunch I have had the pleasure of eating was here. I had the SAKAGURA Lunch Tasting Course for $30.00 and it was a steal! Every bite was a delight and the presentation and atmosphere spot on.
Allison D.}Brooklyn, NY}28}38}0}-1}5}4/3/2012}Oh snap does this place know how to grill pork.  I can still taste the buttery goodness in the back of my throat and I don't ever want it to go away.
David C.}Washington, DC}1}70}0}-1}5}4/3/2012}This place was a wonderful surprise. We were looking for sushi, and stumbled on Sakagura. No sushi, but amazing Japanese inspired small plates. And, of course, incredible sake.If you go, be sure to try the black cod - it was amazing.
Karthik D.}Buffalo, NY}22}3}0}-1}5}3/30/2012}We were randomly walking around on a Friday night looking to go to a good place for dinner in midtown. I looked this place up, and after going through some hallways we ended up in the basement that seemed like a world of its own. It was quite busy, and we were amused that there was such a popular restaurant in the basement. Firstly, the ambiance is great. Its a vibrant place with a rustic feel that ranges between traditional japanese and casual. The waiters were very nice and responsive. I'm vegetarian, and she was very helpful in finding something I would like. The sake selection is frankly overwhelming for a noob like me, and again she was very helpful in finding us something that we might (and did) enjoy. Food is tapas style, with lots of small plates. The range of flavors I got from my food were just outstanding. It was the fourth of july for my taste buds. To top it off, we had the chocolate souffle for dessert which was amazing as well. The icing on the cake was that the check was totally reasonable. I would surely go back to this place, and recommend it to my friends. All in all, a wonderful evening thanks to my discovery of Sakagura.
Tony C.}San Francisco, CA}2}3}0}-1}5}3/27/2012}Really amazing Japanese cuisine, not to mention a very comprehensive sake menu. Having spent time in Japan, I can recognize good vs great. This is great. The fluke carpaccio with salmon roe was phenomenal. Whenever I make it there again, I can't imagine not ordering it. And adding to this restaurant's allure is that you have to walk into a non-descript lobby next to an Avis car rental outlet and head down a narrow set of stairs into this Japanese oasis in mid-town. I went on a Sunday night around 8pm. It wasn't crowded, but was active. Sat at the bar and had great service. In addition to the carpaccio, I had the seaweed salad, pork belly (a self-proclaimed specialty), and  one of the daily specials - which one, I can't remember, due, I'm sure, to the 375mL bottle of unfiltered sake that complemented my meal. but I do remember that I also really enjoyed the seaweed salad served with the vinaigrette dressing. the salad includes 4 different types of seaweed, each with a distinct taste, color and texture. And it's healthy to boot!  If you like Japanese cuisine, you will love Sakagura.
Yekaterina M.}Woodside, NY}204}114}12}-1}5}3/26/2012}-- The aesthetics of the place are amazing - definitely one of the more beautiful dinners I've ever had.  -- The plum-flavored sake (the first one listed in that section), was so delicious, we blew through a nice chunk of change just drinking that.  -- The eggplant with 3-sauces was so delectable, I've never tasted eggplant that good, and I know my eggplant.  The only meh-comment is that the fried almond-crusted shrimp balls were surprisingly rubbery.  The pork belly dish was generous and well made.  -- Overall, everything is very tasty and beautifully presented.  A great spot to treat yourself to.
Alex W.}New York, NY}6}130}0}-1}4}3/24/2012}Hidden in the basement of an office building, this is the perfect "fancy" izakaya. You really can't go wrong with any dish here. A bit pricey, but if you have the money, this is a go-to.
Izzy I.}Manhattan, NY}221}68}84}-1}4}3/22/2012}We didn't eat but what a cool spot! You have to know where to find it and can get confused by the sushi place upstairs disguised as it!!!We had Saki off of their amazing sake list...Pretty crowd, Good service.Its in the basement of a building and its Japanese tapas...Not that I tried them!The Saki was deeeeeelicious! and the choice was ENORMOUS!!! I do not describe much as enormous...lolDefinitely a must try in  NYC!
Clare Q.}Manhattan, NY}30}34}104}-1}3}3/14/2012}The food was not that impressive. The only memorable dish was the braised beef tongue. All the other dishes were mediocre.
Stacey S.}New York, NY}123}76}17}-1}5}3/11/2012}I've mentioned Sakagura in at least a couple of my other reviews because really, it's the perfect benchmark, standing for a restaurant that consistently delivers. Seriously, should a restaurant provide comparable taste, service and atmosphere with Sakagura's consistency, I'd be a huge fan of it as well. I love, love, love my meals here, especially paired with one or two bottles/carafes of their recommended sake.  The menu is extensive and the dishes are designed to be shared (~ 7 to 10 selections between two people)... although I guarantee that you'll find some that you'll just really want all to yourself (e.g., the fatty and delicious stewed pork and the onsen tamago (gosh, the brilliance of the mind that put together a soft boiled egg with ikura and uni!)). The eggplant with three kinds of miso, the fluke carpaccio, the tuna tartar, and the shrimp balls with almonds are also some of my favorites. In addition, there's always a seasonal specials page that should not be skipped.Reservations are good to have... this place is no longer a secret.
Eliza C.}Jackson Heights, Queens, NY}66}72}15}-1}5}3/11/2012}If there are many regrets in your life, I guarantee  one of them will not be getting the grilled black cod with sweet soy sauce at this place.
Bonneil K.}New York, NY}9}63}17}-1}5}3/8/2012}Went in with high expectations, came out with a big smile on my face, my beautiful girlfriend by my side, and a very happy tummy. We sat by the bar, and were instantly greeted by our friendly waiter. Our sake knowledge was quite limited to say the least, but with the help of our enthusiastic waiter, we chose the perfect bottle of sake that complemented well with the fried shrimp, grilled eggplant, and the yellowtail sashimi we had ordered. Highly recommended, amazing girl, oops i mean food, a wonderful "underground" ambience, and a very memorable experience...walked out of the restaurant feeling like a million dollars, partially due to the sake, and mostly due to the great company :)
Rebecca C.}San Francisco, CA}624}732}1755}18}5}3/6/2012}love this place and would come back over and over again. this is the upscale yet comfort food place with a very unstated but calming and elegant decor. Food is authentic, I come back whenever I can when I come back to Nyc and my love affair with Sakagura continues...fantastic sake selection. BEST DISHES:Chawanmushi is the best in town, with a bit of chicken, shrimp, large edamameShishito peppers - Best shishito peppers ever. Perfected cooked. Crunchy, not mushy, perfectly salted. SOLID:miso black codGrilled red snapper collarAVOID:Seaweed salad - I didn't like all of the seaweed saladSashimi - even though sushi is pretty good here, sakagura doesn't excel in it.
Man Y.}Davis, CA}0}17}8}-1}5}3/5/2012}Love this place very much. I went to this place twice during my four days trip in NY. It's a bit hard to find the place as it located in the Basement.For lunch time. I love their soba, it's very tasty. Their sashimi is good quality as well. If you go there during lunch time, you must try their soba. There are a lot of people eating in the restaurant.  The restaurant opened at 11:30am, and we made our reservation at 11:30 am too. I discovered that the restaurant was already full at 12pm.
Bryant R.}Manhattan, NY}99}496}0}18}5}3/2/2012}The food and atmosphere here are excellent.  The menu is broad and the preparations are delectable.  You could point out items blindfolded and be satisfied with your choice.  This place goes over very well with dates and guests from out of town.
Lisa W.}New York, NY}13}33}17}-1}4}3/1/2012}There's something about hidden places that really pumps me up. No, the entrance to this place is not dissimilar to getting your car from a parking garage. But once you glide down that staircase, you enter this magical world of delectable dishes. Japanese tapas style. On our Valentine's Day excursion, we easily ordered 8 mini plates. Among the top were the fluke and pork belly. We also got rice, which paired greatly with the succulent sauce from the pork belly. Did I mention how tasty this was? I can imagine my Grandma slow-simmering this dish all afternoon to intensify the sweet and savory flavors. If only my Grandma were Japanese....and lived close by.The decor is pretty major. What? Ten foot samurai mask hanging above our heads? We are totally not in Kansas anymore.
Adam W.}New York, NY}15}152}1}-1}5}2/27/2012Updatedreview}If you're looking for an authentic Japanese food experience, this is as good as it gets. From the sake to the Japanese toilets, Sakagura nails every detail.Every single dish here is subtle and carefully prepared, exactly as the best Japanese food should be. The sake list is extensive, and the servers are quite knowledgeable about the entire selection. For a "fine dining" experience, this is about as close to Tokyo as you can get from New York.That said, you should know what you're getting when you come here. I came here before visiting Japan and couldn't appreciate the quality. Just don't expect any Americanized flavors.
Bruce B.}Las Vegas, NV}9}111}2}-1}4}2/26/2012}Excellent Japanese food. Not a sushi restaurant more like Japanese tapas. It's mainly cooked dishes and some raw fish dishes.
Vincent L.}Manhattan, NY}618}130}15}-1}5}2/24/2012}amazing food.  i've been to many japanese food restaurants in nyc and this place and blue ribbon are my favorites.  it has a great selection of sake for those who enjoy sake and the food is really something spectacular.  you know sometimes you eat at a place and it's just an experience that makes you feel good?  this is that kind of place.  the food, like many japanese food restaurants, is mostly served tapas style and great to enjoy with a small group.  i really have no complaints about the dishes here at all.  it is quite pricey though and the space is weird.  it's located in a basement of an office building.  not too sure what the story behind this is, but it's just weird.  the overall feel of the restaurant is also somewhat lame and generic.  it's dark.  the bathrooms are proudly located at the entrance and they have public bidets, which is gross, needless to say i didn't use it.  overall the ambiance is pretty stupid and can definitely use a redesign and change in space.  however i still give it five stars, a testament to how good the food is.  my mouth waters when i think about eating there.
Alice C.}Menlo Park, CA}47}75}8}-1}4}2/23/2012}Why are all the best Japanese restaurants in basements of office buildings?  We were reminded of our search for Mizutani in Tokyo (one of the best, if not THE best sushi bar in Tokyo) as we were directed down to the basement of this office building by the evening security guard.  We were not very warmly welcomed, as the maitre'd pointed out to us that we were more than 15 minutes late for our reservation, and asked us to wait a minute while she figured out where to put us as she apparently had given our table away.  I was particularly annoyed by the welcome when I was led into the dining room and saw that there were plenty of available tables to be had.  That being said, the actual dinner service was quite good, and the food was as good as advertised.  Our favorites were the beef tongue (so tender and flavorful), the tori tsukune (chicken meatballs), and the jaga dango (light, just slightly sweet, mashed potato donuts, essentially).  Yes, you can find tsukune at any izakaya or yakitori place, but these were maybe the best I've ever tried.  The jaga dango was simply like nothing I've ever tried before.The gindara yuan yaki (soy marinated cod) and jidori shioyaki (grilled organic free range chicken) were other standout dishes.  With so much talk about how small the dishes were, we definitely went overboard, and ended up with too much food.  We were actually quite surprised at the healthy portions of jidori shioyaki and beef tongue that were served.  Oh well, you can do much worse than leftover tori tsukune for breakfast the next day.
Rita L.}Manhattan, NY}1497}521}5346}18}4}2/23/2012}got a bara chirashi don set from their Thursday daily special (50 sets) with cold soba for $11.50 (w/o tip/tax). It's pretty good, but a bit pricey esp. since they didn't put a lot of sashimi but they did have a lot of rice under the thin layer of fish/eel thing.
Issy H.}New York, NY}3}24}78}-1}4}2/22/2012}Sakagura is located in the basement of an obscure office building.  We never would've discovered the place if we didn't see the sign outside.  We walked in on a whim the first time on a Saturday night, but were turned away since we didn't have reservations.  So if you want to dine here on Friday or Saturday night make sure you make reservations well in advance.We order the steamed egg, grilled tile fish and cod, chilled roast duck to start.  I would definitely recommend the steamed egg, tile fish, and roast duck. I wasn't a big fan of the cod, it was a bit too salty and thought the one at zenkichi is much better.  We also got the steamed rice cooked with snow crab meat from the menu of recommended dishes.  It came in a cute stone pot and was so delicious.  Then came the desserts. We got Chocolate souffle and the pear millefeuille.  The pear millefuille came with earl gray ice cream.  It was a great way to end the meal
Susan L.}Manhattan, NY}313}420}670}18}3}2/19/2012}The restaurant opens exactly at 6pm, even if you go earlier- it isn't open. The place is in the basement and it's actually not that visible to find since you have to go into the building. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice and there were masks on the wall. The tuna tartar had a fishy taste to it which I don't think it's suppose to be there. The homemade "Nihachi Soba" and "Inaniwa" udon noodle from Akita wasn't that great. However, the desserts were delicious. The chocolate souffle with the ice cream was a good combination since you can take a bite of the warm chocolate souffle and then a bite of cold ice cream- YUM!! As for the black sesame cream brulee, it was unique since it was my first time trying it and is definitely worth a try. The other dessert seemed like it's Gâteau aux Marrons and it only tasted alright. Also, the fruity cocktail I got was pretty good. I believe this place is more for having a drink with appetizers rather than having a real dinner.
Matt M.}Manhattan, NY}11}121}0}-1}3}2/19/2012}12 years ago this place used to be very cool. I wish I did not tell anyone about it, especially Nancy...
Yu Sheng W.}Manhattan, NY}8}2}2}-1}4}2/17/2012}Indeed a hidden gem, located in the basement of an office building, it was a near miss. Based on some reliable rumours, some friends and I decided to try out their 30-sets-a-day Higawari Hayashi Rice Don, which was very competitively priced.The set itself looked impressive for $11.50, with a bowl of hashed beef rice and cold soba noodles with dip. The rice was cooked to perfection while the beef literally melted in my mouth. Though the soba was a tad over-cooked to my preference, the soy-sauce based dip formed a satisfying combination. With the right portions of wasabi, spring onion and orange peel in the dip, the soba's natural taste is brought out well, with the peel adding a tinge of freshness.They only serve this set on Fridays this month, so go early to have it. And if you are there between 11.30am and noon, you can get a stamp on the loyalty card which entitles you to free desserts and the like. Definitely a good deal, I think!The service was a charm, albeit the waiters were clearer better at Japanese than English. Nonetheless, the hot towels before and after the meals really completes the entire experience.It was a pity that we did not try any sake since it was the middle of the day but I'll update this review once I have tried the sake too.
Holly C.}New York, NY}405}1256}5}-1}5}2/17/2012}Simply amazing.Even though there's a sign outside the building, we still had difficulty finding this restaurant. Once you're inside, you go downstairs, and it's a different world. It's big, but still has that low-key, underground feel which I loved. I'm glad we sat by the bar - the bartender made great food and drink recommendations. Aside from St. Mark's, my sake knowledge is very limited. Based on what we thought we would like, he brought us three different cold sakes. It was crisp, semi-sweet, dry sake which I really liked - and I thought I only liked hot sake!We ordered the fried shrimp, Sashoku Nasu Dengaku (grilled Japanese eggplants with three different kinds of miso - eggyolk, spinach, sweet red), and 2 orders of yellowtail sashimi. I'm really picky about my sashimi - I only like it thinly sliced - but even so, the way it was fileted & the quality was absolutely delicious. It practically melted in my mouth.It's not a cheap place to go, but the price is worth the quality and service.
Jenny C.}Jersey City, NJ}69}60}6}-1}5}2/15/2012}Oh, how I heart you, Sakagura.  Why must you always be so crowded?  I know, I know, it's because you are so yummy.  Stupid question.  The food is excellent and the sake selection is fantastic.  While I don't have a go-to sake, the servers are more than knowledgeable on the different sakes and which one would satisfy your tastes.  I don't think I've had the same sake each time I have gone.Do try:  Gyu miso nikomi (stewed beef), Kama roast (duck), Buta kakuni (pork belly), Daikon salad (refreshing!), Miso eggplant.  I for one, am a huge fan of rice....so I never pass on a Mentai onigiri (spicy cod roe rice ball).  The desserts are the perfect ending to a succulent meal.  Black sesame creme brulee and the soufle are surefire wins.
Saara H.}Manhattan, NY}80}136}0}-1}4}2/8/2012}So good! Such a hidden surprise (in the basement of regular office building) in Midtown - Sakagura will probably be a go-to, nice dinner spot when I'm craving quality protein.Everything was cooked perfectly especially the cod, duck, and beef ribs.
Vanessa X.}Chicago, IL}169}486}0}-1}5}2/7/2012}Really amazing food, no wonder it's packed on any typical night. It was a good thing we came late around 10 on a Monday night and it was nice and empty. Everything on the menu looks unusual and delicious, but I finally decided to go with the "Sake Oyako Don" which are fillets of fresh salmon sashimi and salmon roe steeped in soy sauce served atop a bowl of rice and served with miso soup. It was absolutely perfect. The salmon roe crushed into the rice was full of umami and I could not have asked for better silky salmon. The miso soup was also great, rich and nourishing. There was a side of cucumbers which I dumped into the miso soup, and some wasabi as well but I didn't use that. No need to mess with what's already perfect!I love that it's located in the basement of an office building - you would never think such a lovely oasis exists in such banal environment. Sake bottles line the walls and the blue cotton curtains and wooden furniture are wonderfully Japanese. The sake list is quite extensive, so for sake lovers, this is the place to go.Finally, we topped off our excellent meals with a chocolate soufflé. Oh my. A little spoonful of vanilla ice cream, a dip into the warm gooey chocolate soufflé and a little dab of sweet raspberry sauce on the side... I don't even remember what happened next.
Annie P.}New York, NY}11}84}31}-1}5}2/4/2012}so goood! japanese food + small plates + sake and beer = a happy stomach. I'm a big fan of japanese small plate dishes since I like to try a different array of dishes when I'm eating out and this is the best method taste a bit of everything, especially if you're up to trying new items. Their sake selection is expansive and there are pairing suggestions to dishes marked on the menu for you. Word of caution, the small plates are more filling than they looked, I definitely over ordered, especially the heavy deep fried stuffed potatoes. Great place to chill over food and drink and catch up with people.
Cathy S.}Apex, NC}20}135}310}-1}2}2/2/2012}I feel that Sakagura is more western-oriented than traditional ones. The food here is really mediocre even for an izakaya, and lacks variety. Sake is their strong suit, but how can i enjoy good sake with so-so food? Ambiance and decor also leans onto the modern, or fusion side, which i hate. But it seems NYC lacks decent izakayas so this one is probably the best you can get.
Michelle K.}Manhattan, NY}13}140}0}-1}5}2/1/2012}This is exceptionally high quality Japanese food, not your typical sushi place, but they have lots of inventive and different dishes that really please the palate. I'm not crazy about the fact that it is in a basement, but the food really can't be beat, and service and ambiance are both great!
Luz L.}Yonkers, NY}50}97}8}-1}4}1/31/2012}Reviewers below seriously exaggerate the small size of the dishes, what do they expect from tapas?? I'm six months pregnant and I left feeling very full and content without breaking the bank. Here is what our group of 4 had:JIDORI SHIOYAKI : grilled organic free range chicken with sea salt and yuzu citrus pepper. Delicious! Moist and flavorful. One of my favorite dishes.SURUMEIKA YAKI : Grilled Japanese squid. Pretty good, light, tasty and not chewy. Good portion.EBI SHINJO : Deep fried shrimp balls covered with sliced almonds. Was okay, filling, and almonds are a nice touch.GYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded beef back ribs stewed in miso topped with grated daikon radish. This was amazing. The meat is tender and so flavorful. A few nice bites for all of us.EBI STICK : Deep fried shrimp roll with "nori" seaweed andoba leaf served with a miso sauce. Pretty good! A nice crunch and the dipping sauce was yummy. Six pieces.We also had some edamame, standard fare and one of the specials a hot noodle soup that was delicious. The highlight of the night, as most have said, is the black sesame creme brulee. We split two and I could have scarfed done a whole one myself. Overall it was a really great dinner. We all left full and very satisfied. Bill was $40 a person including tip. I can't wait to go back!
Jules T.}Astoria, NY}130}255}206}-1}3}1/23/2012}Great dessert (chocolate mousse was delicious) and sake. I wish we came before the kitchen closed.
joanne m.}New York, NY}8}41}3}-1}4}1/21/2012}Came here on a Friday night around 930.   Almost walked by the place. . you haveto walk though a commercial building past the elevators and down a set of stairs to get to the restaurant. Although the restaurant was in the basement, definitely did not feel confined at all.  I really liked the decor.  Never been to Japan, but I would imagine that's what it would like if I visited.  As it is a Japanese tapas place, be sure to order enough food since the portions are on the small side.  I was with a party of five, so we each ordered 2-3 dishes each. Must order the crab and rice dish.  I think it's the most expensive thing on the menu besides sushi sashimi, but it's definitely worth the price. It was served in a large pot, which the waiter scooped out for us into small rice bowls.  With 2 orders of that dish everyone had a full bowl of rice.  Without the rice I'm sure everyone would still be hungry at the end of the meal.Overall it was a solid meal, nothing spectacular, but with the ambiance, good food and service,  a place worth returning to for dinner.  The highlights were the washu beef , buta and tori karaage ( fried pork and chicken), uni soba, beef tongue, tuna tartar, and the sesame creme brûlée (Delicious). Everything else we ordered was 'okay'.  As with any tapas place, the prices add up quickly.  For 2 people, sake and food could easily add up to 100 bucks.  The meal came up to 60 bucks each, including sake and tip- not too bad for a 5 people. I read on other reviews that they have a good selection of sake. Unfortunately, the only disappointment was our sake.. We asked our waiter to recommend one for us.  It wasn't a hit for the table, but it wasnt bad either.  Some people complained it was salty.  No complaints from me.  Anyway, sakagura would be a good place for a date or drinks.  Will be back for a date now that I know what items to order.
R Y.}Manhattan, NY}43}270}340}-1}2}1/20/2012}So, I've been here twice and It's a mere MEH for me.First off, you better NOT be a big eater because MOST of their dishes are about the size of your palm (not shaquille o'neal palms, but average population) - some about the size of two of your fingers put together. They are more of japanese "tapas" so the portions are small and on average these tapas range from $6-9. The more expensive ones like the tuna tartar with caviar are over $10, but still about the size of your palm. I went to this place for dinner twice and surprisingly, they are pretty loud. The music is actually louder than what I expected of the ambiance because people come on dates to nibble in an expensive restaurant to impress their dates or group of friends who wants to venture a little out there. I do have to admit that their food is quite fresh, but honestly if I"m paying around $10 per dish about the size of my palm, I EXPECT IT TO BE TOP NOTCH! Their (raw) fluke and tuna dishes melt in your mouth as they marry with daikon and caviar. Their meat balls have tasty sauces that topped them.Hence, my rating is 2 stars because the portions are NOT satisfactory and for me (or normal people I think) to be happy, you would easily break $100 easy. Additionally, if I am going to spend THAT much money, I'd prefer a better atmosphere where it's more intimate and fish to be even better, because i have to admit that I have had better tuna tartar and fluke for about the same price, if not cheaper.
Lauren K.}Manhattan, NY}38}216}2}-1}4}1/20/2012}Mmm. Lots of interesting sushi and sashimi combinations.  My mom ordered sake and said it was to die for. Expensive, with small portions, but worth a trip here.Beware-- its in a basement, but don't hesitate. The decor inside is beautiful once you're inside!
Shone J.}Manhattan, NY}0}5}0}-1}4}1/19/2012}I recently went there with friends. Overall, the food was good and I would def go again. However, the menu is a little overwhelming and not very organized. Same goes for the sake and (very limited) wine/cocktail list. Pay attention when ordering because the prices add up.Overall I would go again. The service was pleasant AND when I left my wallet there, I was called and everything returned promptly. They get an extra star for that!
Annie P.}Fairfax, VA}1772}976}824}18}4}1/19/2012}This is definitely a "hidden gem" in Midtown.  It's tucked away in a basement with NO reception, and the interior is amazing.  I felt like I was in Tokyo.  There's an overwhelming selection of sake (they give you an actual binder style menu to pick out of) and we ended up asking the server to help us out, and he picked well.  You can order them in 1/2 bottles as well.  He also recommended a great plum wine for my girlfiend and I... I wish I could remember the name because it was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, plus with real plum pulp.  The dishes come one at a time, but the timing is perfect.  We ordered the seaweed salad with ginger dressing, beef tataki, mashed potatoes covered in sweet donut batter, beef tongue, pork belly, and kara age. (organic fried chicken)  We also ordered the black sesame creme brulee and the pear millefuielle for dessert.  I ENJOYED EVERY DISH... except for the pork belly because it wasn't what I expected...  I've had better pork belly elsewhere.The service was on point throughout the night.  Dishes were replaced, water and sake glasses were constantly refilled to the point where I didn't even notice that they refilled them!  I would come back here again for a special occasion, but not for a regular meal because it was a little pricier than I expected.
seth g.}Hastings-on-Hudson, NY}654}10}4}-1}5}1/16/2012}Healthy Soba Salad.I don't need to say anything else. Three words. Best lunch in midtown. Ask for extra noodles.
Carolyn Y.}Brooklyn, NY}31}96}8}-1}5}1/11/2012}Love this place! The interior was gorgeous. We made a reservation at six when it opened and most other tables looked reserved as well, so I recommend doing the reservation. The place was pretty packed even for a Monday night. We had the wagyu beef (so tender and tasty), tuna tartar (this had a more subtle tuna flavor which I wish were stronger, but it was still good), the buta kakuni pork belly (amazing! It came in layers with the fat on top and the juicy pork underneath). The prices were very reasonable for the quality, especially the pork belly. And of course, the bathroom is awesome with an Asian bidet found in a little hut in the middle of the restaurant. Service was also great - we left something behind and they called us to let us know afterward. Just a reminder that the restaurant is down the stairs in the building and there's no reception.
Paul C.}Manhattan, NY}320}746}205}-1}4}1/10/2012}I agree with Mona--4.5.Important tip: Zero cell reception at this place. The first time I went I was with a person who was on call and we had to leave because no one could get a signal.On to the review. I don't eat meat, just putting that out there, and every veggie and fish dish I got last night killed it.  The edamame had this subtle smoked salt thing going on that was a great way to get things started.Then the eel. Yum. I thought since it was cold it might be a bit weird but it was great--firm and sweet and well balanced with the nori and cucumber.On to some squid--grilled amazingly with zero chewiness.The almond crusted shrimp rolls were heavenly with this nutty toasty flavor. You couldn't tell they were shrimp--it may as well have been chicken--and I actually think that was great and added to the dish.Their black cod was just what you'd expect--buttery and falling apart in your mouth. Two quarter fillets were just the right amount too.All throughout this experience our waiter/bartender (we ate at the bar) suggested two great junmai sakes. Since you can order half bottles and quarter bottles we took some chances and man did they pay off.We didn't try dessert but I'd imagine if we did we'd be equally impressed!
Mona L.}Los Angeles, CA}189}312}44}-1}4}1/3/2012}4.5.Fine dining hidden isakaya gem with endless sake collection and superb, flawless presentation of food and sake. Who knew sake could look so beautiful? Each carafe order of sake is distinctly presented with a flower petal and a special case.  Since sake is so easy to drink, the carafe size can be quite deceiving.  If you can drink, ordering the large is more worthwhile. Everything we tried tasted good, but by far my favorites were the pork belly, grilled Japanese squid, tuna tar-tare and their black sesame creme brulee.  But if I could go back again and just choose two items, I'd choose their tuna tar-tare and the black sesame creme brulee. Their tuna tar-tare is heavenly, out beating all the fine dining restaurants in the city! Its perfection is attributed to its exceptional quality and freshness and unique two layers-- the tuna with yuzu (citrusy flavor) and caviar.   And the black sesame creme brulee exemplies the magic of fusing Asian and French/English cuisine. There's nothing like it which is why is also so special and to die for!Did I mention how cool the restroom is?  Sakagura is seriously all about pleasant surprises, starting with its location and ending with the restroom experience.  Only reason why I am not giving this a five is because I can't come here as often as I'd like---it is the priciest isakaya in Manhattan and worth dining for special occasions.   Note: Be sure you don't go out after dining here because you leave smelling like bbq.
elisa e.}Flemington, NJ}81}57}32}-1}4}1/3/2012}Not easy to find but once uncovered it is a TRUE Japanese meal that you will surely enjoy! If you are looking for the typical Japanese menu then this is not for you.  Yelp helped me find this gem, I was accompanied by my Japanese manager and two other co-workers. My manager was so impressed and excited about the menu that he ordered for us - through out the meal he kept complimenting and explaining that our meals were prepared the REAL Japanese way!  ALL of our meals were DELICIOUS and I would certainly recommend this restaurant.  Service was excellent, atmosphere was good and clean!Enjoy!!
Agustin K.}New York, NY}703}1004}441}18}4}1/2/2012}High quality Japanese meal and especially good value during lunch time.  Please do make reservation so to ensure prompt seating.  They are always packed around lunch time.  For about $15 you will be full and satisfied.
Lindsay C.}Manhattan, NY}23}49}1}-1}4}1/1/2012}Sakagura was my first japanese tapas dining experience. My boyfriend and I were able to get a same day reservation for 7:30pm on a Tuesday - which was a score considering this place can be packed. I had read about the hidden-ish entrance so I wasn't phased by the exterior of the building - but my boyfriend was pretty convinced I was leading him into a darkened basement to kill him. Once we got to Sakagura and saw the awesome atmosphere we were both really excited. I based our food picks off other Yelp reviews since we were both pretty unfamiliar with this type of food. We went with the steaks on hot stone, tuna sashimi, tofu salad, fried mushroom and taro, the fried chicken bits, chicken meatballs, and one of the fish dishes, and of course the creme brulee. Everything was so delicious! Service wasn't rushed, the dishes came out gradually so we sipped our sake and were able to really enjoy our meal. It was a very cozy date spot. May seem a little expensive but we were out of there under $140 for a full meal including sake and a few beers. I've since been back several times for lunch and while the food is still top notch (and they have good lunch specials), its definitely a little more hectic with the lunchtime traffic from all the local businesses.
Diana K.}San Mateo, CA}789}728}14}-1}5}12/29/2011Updatedreview}Just as delicious as I remembered-- the clear winners were the pork belly and beef tongue. We also got the kimchee don, which is still one of my most favorite dishes of all time. Service was attentive, as expected, and we were able to enjoy a nice conversation because of the cozy ambiance.My friend was sick (not because of the food), so he couldn't finish his kimchee don. And technically, we're not supposed to take any leftovers home, but the restaurant made an exception for us. (Thank you, Sakagura!)
May L.}Manhattan, New York, NY}591}464}229}18}3}12/26/2011}This is one of the nicer Japanese tapas place in the city. For you folks that only ever equate Japanese food with Sushi, you will be disappointed.  The sushi here is fine, but it's a bit of a waste. As this place is in the basement of a building with no sign except at the top of the stairs of the basement, it goes on my Hide & Seek list.  The food is excellent. This was my first try of Japanese rice balls.  They do a great job here.  The beef tongue skewers were great. I also agree with the dish choices of Franklin B's reviews.  The saki selection is fantastic and the service is typically polite Japanese.  If you're taking out native Japanese peeps, you'll do fine with this as a choice.  Definitely worth a try.
Jim T.}Hoboken, NJ}2}183}2}-1}4}12/23/2011}I went here about 5 years ago and loved it but forgot about it. Recently, I read about it and decided to go again. Wow, great food- Like Japanese tapas. The sake selection is awesome. We dropped some coin on a $215 bottle. Best sake I ever had. We had a lot of different food- pork meatballs, cod in soy sauce, Tuna sashimi, edamame, squid grilled with soy sauce and more. All excellent. Great service and cool ambience
Vicky C.}Brooklyn, NY}52}77}59}-1}3}12/23/2011}Maybe it was because I had too high expectations for Sakagura due to the Yelp reviews or due to the fact that I recently (well about 3 months ago) had been to another izakaya that was in Hawaii that every dish that I tried was amazing and I wanted to find another one like that here in NYC but this one wasn't up to par.I'd brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. Sakagura doesn't do birthday specials just so you know. The bill came out to around $150 which included 5 dishes, 2 desserts and a carafe of sake.The only memorable dish was the beef tongue. Now that will be something I'll reorder again if I do come back. It's stewed in miso so it's very tender. It came in huge cubes which was a little different from my usual sliced tongues. The daikon and spinach and mushroom that came with it was all soaked with miso and oh so juicy. It's not one of their specialty dishes so one can have it at anytime. All the desserts are worth trying. We opted for the black sesame creme brulee and pear millefeuille. Yum yum yum. Japanese restaurants usually don't offer very many options for dessert (besides the usual bland green tea ice cream) but Sakagura had quite an impressive list.The sake we had were a special one, something about 12th year anniversary or 12th year something. The point is that it's very fruity and light. Good for white wine drinkers. I can't say that it'd still be on the menu though since it was "special".Oh the place wasn't hard to find at all. It's just a little more walking than just through a door like most other restaurants. Common sense is all you need to find it.
Andy X.}New York, NY}16}249}5}-1}4}12/21/2011}After entering office building lobby, you walk down a stairwell which is only what I can describe as something I've seen in a movie.   I felt like I was walking into a basement whorehouse in a 3rd world country.  Cool little joint in the basement.  Came here for a birthday dinner with family.  Say in one of the booths past the pisser on the right when you walk in.  Plenty of space for 6 and ventilation.  Food was good and as expected.  Service was pretty good.  Typical polite semi-confused Japanese staff. A grown man would have to eat anywhere from 100-150 worth of food to feel any satisfaction here. Note shitty cell receptionWould repeat.
Elizabeth Y.}Manhattan, NY}2}11}0}-1}5}12/20/2011}We had a really enjoyable meal at Sakagura last night.  We tried two of their newly-arrived sakes and each had a Masu to ourselves (bigger than a carafe, smaller and much cheaper than the whole bottle).  We are light to moderate drinkers and this was enough for us.  The sake was delicious! We then ordered a variety of items off the menu, all of which were incredible.  We are vegetarian, so there are many but not a plethora of options (unless you are a fish-eating veg, which we are not).  We probably ordered one of most of the vegetarian items, about 6 plates in total, and this was a good amount of food for us. Finally, we ordered the chocolate souffle with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberry sauce, and the black sesame creme brulee with ice cream of the same flavor.  Both of these desserts were excellent, but we LOVED the creme brulee!  It ended the meal in an amazing way.  We ate at the bar since there weren't any tables available (we called the day of our reservation), and this was just as fine as a table, although you see the wait staff working so hard!  As you can see from all the reviews, this place is well worth a visit..or MANY visits!
Eileen J.}New York, NY}41}185}0}-1}4}12/16/2011}I wish I did more here so this review is very brief and topline if you will.So after my office holiday party, I met up with a friend and his coworker at Sakagura since we were looking for a drinking place situated near the 4/5/6 train haha.  So his coworker (who deserves brownie points for creative problem solving) found this speakeasy-ish sake bar gem in the city.  I literally walked past this place like 2 times as I was in search for some huge banner or board with the name of this place.  Instead I should have been looking for a little sign near a  parking garage entrance haha.  The interior is so swanky and I loved everything from the booths to the bathrooms.  Can't really comment on the food as I only ordered rice balls and our main purpose was to drink but what I had was presented nicely and tasty.  My friend and his co-workers ordered dessert and who knew earl gray ice cream would taste so soothing!! Loved that.  Sadly, as I was not in the right state of mind to know what sake we ordered, I can say that as not a huge fan of sake, I was pleasantly pleased.  As sake has a strong taste for me, I liked how this one wasn't as a kick into your face lol.I would totally come here again just to chill and have a good time :)
Jerrica J.}New York, NY}963}1360}221}-1}5}12/7/2011Updatedreview}Happy my favorite Japanese restaurant can still be so accomodating for my new vegan & gluten-free lifestyle.I told my server about my diet and she recommended cold soba noodles with sesame dipping sauce! It was delicious and perfect for me. I also had some shishito peppers on the side so it made me very happy!
Aki N.}San Francisco, CA}167}394}62}-1}5}12/4/2011}Favorite sake bar in US, great selection and izakaya dishes with attentive Japanese service. The food is fantastic, try the onsen tamago, a soft boiled egg with uni and ikura. The bartenders do a good job with recommendations on sake, as the list can be overwhelming with coverage across Japan.It's located in a nondescript office building. Walk through the lobby and past the guard to the basement restaurant. Quite a beautiful space.
David K.}McKinney, TX}0}92}0}-1}4}12/2/2011}We went here on a recommendation from a friend as their "best sushi in NYC" entry.  It was only after we went that I read the rave reviews on here and I have to agree, it is pretty freaking awesome.  Once you find the place, which isn't easy, and cross into the dining room, you step into a teleporter and enter into what feels exactly like Japan.We went super late (11:45 I think) on a Friday (far and away the best time to pound raw fish) and were almost the only people there so our service was great and the food was spectacular.  The atmosphere is awesome.  We had a great time all around, can't wait to go back and further explore the menu.I should say that this is not a place for people whose idea of sushi is a California roll right next to a mayo drenched spicy tuna roll.  I'm pretty sure nothing like that is even on the menu.  This is for hard core sushi aficionados who can handle some fermented soy beans on there perfectly tender maguro.  There are things to tide over the less adventurous but you'll have the most fun if you can branch out and try some different stuff.
Franklin B.}Queens, NY}105}31}10}-1}5}11/27/2011}Reservations are impossible to come by at this place, so a friend and I thought we would take our chances on a Sunday night and just walk in. I had never been here before, so after being dropped off on 43rd and 3rd and wandering around a bit, I finally stumbled upon the building complex that Sakagura is located in. Walked down the shady looking stairs and...wow. A modern restaurant with simple yet elegant decor. Not at all the dark, dingy sake den I was imagining in my mind. We waited about 30 minutes for a seat at the "bar", which suited us just fine. This was around 7:30pm, would recommend going earlier, ~6pm for a shorter wait (I had called ahead and the wait at 6pm would have been only 10-15 minutes)Once we sat down, service was prompt, we ordered mugs of warm roasted green tea and began peering at all the intricate dishes on the menu. Each dish was very fresh and presented a variety of flavors while maintaining balance. Washed down with a cup of roasted Japanese green tea.Dishes ordered:Salmon Sashimi - 3 slices, extremely fresh, wasabi was the legit grated kind (not the usual out of a tube)Onsen Tamago - amazing small poached egg in a cold broth with sea urchin and salmon roe, definitely recommend for uni loversKamo - a play on traditional peking duck without the flour wrap. Sliced pieces of roast duck with scallions, meant to be eaten together. Cold, tender. You will like it if you like duckAgedashi Tofu - tasted the same as it usually does at other sushi places, nothing too special but I was craving it at the timeChawan Mushi - i can never resist steamed egg dishes and this one was a standout. Came in a little cup, an egg custard with a variety of delicacies buried inside, including chicken and shrimpGyutan Yawaraka Ni - beef tongue. The largest dish out of everything we ordered. A solid 4 chunks of meat, extremely tender and flavorful. Definitely try this. Came in a warm broth with taro and mushroomsButa Kukani - braised pork belly, sold by the piece. Tender, juicy, as you would expect pork belly to be.Desserts: Black Sesame Creme Brulee - delicious, light, not too sweetEarl Grey Tea Homemade Ice Cream - Perfect ending. Cold, cleanses the palate, not too sweet, came with a nice almond cookieAmazing meal overall, the two of us spent about $90 together - keep in mind we didn't have any sake - which was a steal for the gastronomic experience we had.  Would definitely come over and over again to try everything else on the menu.
Emily K.}New York, NY}12}129}5}-1}4}11/27/2011}it feels like you've been transported to Japan as soon as you step inside.  out of the dishes that i tried i likes the eggplant with 3 misos, the tile fish, and black sesame ice cream always makes me happy.  some dishes i recall not being too excited about were the fluke carpaccio, washu beef and tuna w/ mountain yam.  i can't really recall what other dishes we had.  i certainly want to go back and try the other dishes!
Winston G.}Chicago, IL}394}773}18}-1}5}11/23/2011}4.5 starsAmazing sake selection.Great izakaya / Japanese tapas style dishes.  Pork belly was good, but not as tender as I would have preferred.  Sashimi and the other dishes were all very fresh and well prepared.  Average cost of dishes is also very reasonable.Only drawback:  cell phone reception and location in a basement makes it a bit odd.  However, sometimes it's nice to not be bothered by calls / texts during dinner with friends.
Suanne L.}Brooklyn, NY}199}934}755}18}5}11/23/2011}You begin your journey meandering the streets around Grand Central, past the delis and the nondescript parking garages. Amidst the random midtown office buildings, and down the stairs past security, is a haven for Japanese expats and sake lovers alike. The ambiance is intimate, cool, and secretive. If the wood paneling, evening tea house decor doesn't faze you, the delicate small plates surely will. A whole grilled pike mackerel, tender and fresh. A cool and refreshing, yet savory poached Tamago (egg) in dashi with uni and sprouts. A kaisen kimchee don - chopped sashimi with kimchee over rice - was simply divine - spicy fresh fish that had the consistency of butter and unbelievable flavor. And to finish, a pear millefielle. The earl gray ice cream was superb - so much so that it almost overshadowed the juicy pear and crisp phyllo and cream.Now, being adventurous doesn't always pay off so do heed your waiter. The only dish I wasn't enthusiastic about was ika shikara - raw squid with squid liver. Not that it was poorly prepared but more because its probably an acquired taste I wasn't anticipating. That said, the waiter was kind, very knowledgeable and really enhanced our meal. While he couldn't dissuade me from trying the Ika, he did make a fabulous sake recommendation. In addition, the price may seem a smidge high - especially while partaking of the amazing sake selection - but I believe its worth every cent.
Nancy Y.}San Francisco, CA}234}130}7}-1}5}11/20/2011}My favorite casual Japanese place in the city, by far. I have come here multiple times and have never had a bad experience. They put so much thought into every dish and while the food is delicious, it isn't heavy at all. Amazing selection of unique and authentic dishes, won't burn a hole in your wallet, and they even grate their own wasabi. You can tell the wasabi doesn't come out of a tube because it is super fresh and kind of grainy. This place is legit. It's also one of the few nicer japanese restaurants that are open on Sundays (Why is this, btw?).  In addition, while the entryway to the restaurant is super sketchy (pass through a lobby of some parking garage then go down two flights of stairs with bleak whitewashed stone walls), the interior is super cute and traditional, with bamboo altars and tables, empty rice tubs and sake jugs lining warmly-lit shelves. Very intimate and inviting. One of those places where you can talk with a friend for over 3 hours as the server comes out with beautiful dishes one after the other. Some of my favorites:- Beef tongue with daikon- Onsen tamago - soft-boiled egg with sea urchin and roe (This combo of sea urchin with roe and a third ingredient of the mushy variety, i.e. egg, oyster, tofu, etc. is my current OBSESSION, btw.)- spicy grilled codfish- Sakagura special - pork belly- Grilled japanese eggplans in 3 types of miso- Earl grey ice cream- black sesame ice cream with black sesame creme brûléeNeed to get some sake next time I come, since they're very well-known for their selection.
D B.}Nutley, NJ}1}61}0}-1}3}11/20/2011}Had dinner here with my wife and my sister. We ordered about 6 or 7 different items and shared them all. The hot stone where you cook the meat yourself was pretty good (and fun after a few sakes). The ribs in broth were excellent.  But the seasonal sashimi dish with 9 small pieces for $55 was a disappointment. The atmosphere and service was on point. To me, the best part of the meal was the plum wine sampler at the end! Some really great plum wines that I hadn't tried before; very delicious!!
Zando E.}New York, NY}0}99}5}-1}5}11/18/2011}Sakagura is so close to perfection that giving it fewer than 5 stars is being nitpicky. I've spent a lot of time in Japan, and have eaten at many restaurants like this in Tokyo and Osaka. Sakagura would more than hold it's own in that country, and here, it is simply the best of its kind. The combination of exquisite food, a very well-chosen sake list and a lovely, comfortable setting is worth every penny of the considerable price. the sashimi here is fantastic - not a huge selection, but everything is top quality, and expertly presented. The cooked items vary a little more, but only between excellent and pretty damn good. The sake list is extensive, and well-described. Friendly staff will guide you if you're unsure about what to try. Prices are high, but within reason. Lunch prices are better, especially if you resist the urge to drink (I don't, it's a splurge). Japanese restauranteurs are expert and making underground spaces feel warm and intimate, and Sakagura is a great example of that skill--every detail works to make you feel cocooned, not claustrophobic. And yes, the bathrooms are nifty.
Suana W.}San Francisco, CA}130}162}1}-1}4}11/17/2011}awesomely hidden and delicious. i definitely didn't expect to find an authentic japanese oasis in the bowels of an office building, but was pleasantly surprised. so much of NY is subterranean, which i'm still getting used to. anyways, i met up with a coworker and we ordered a few items. also, just a note that the bill was probably pretty hefty but i left feeling about 80% full. small portions but cooked well.- beef that you grill yourself on a little stone: it was good, better after i realized rare was the way to go. it wasn't spectacular though.- fresh sashimi combination: incredibly fresh. i only recognized uni and hamachi, but everything was good.- eggplant: decent. eggplant doesn't wow me but this was quite tasty.- uni soba noodles: my favorite! i'm a sucker for anything uni, so i really enjoyed this. add some seaweed and a dash of grated real wasabi and it was perfect.i would definitely come back! but not before i explore everything else NY has to offer.
Reo T.}Brooklyn, NY}49}192}0}-1}4}11/16/2011}Wheres the bathroom? It's in a big sake barrel shaped room! Interior is awesome. A japanese sake wine restaurant. In the begining I didn't know what the restaurant would look like by going to the basement of an office building but it is spacious and luxurious. Very good for groups and special occasions!
Li Y.}San Francisco, CA}244}98}3}-1}5}11/14/2011}First of all, I don't think this is a $$$ place, more like $$.  I just love the authentic feel of this place, every bit as you walk down to the basement, to the decor and the menu and of course the FOOD.  Great for a quick but high quality and yummy lunch.  We had the soba gozen sets, which were delicious, fast, and a good taste of lots of stuff.  Would definitely be back for dinner and try the rest of the menu!
Cardinal S.}Mountain View, CA}0}154}18}-1}5}11/14/2011}Just ate at Sakagura for the second time.  The first time we went was two years ago for dinner.  I remember everything being very good, and their duck and sesame creme brulee particularly stand out in my memory as being amazing.  Today I went for lunch.  We arrived around 12:40 and they were able to seat our group of four right away.  We were in and out in about 50 minutes.  I thought the lunch prices were incredibly reasonable (about $12-20 for a dish).  The chicken donburi plus soba I ordered was fantastic.
Danny N.}Brooklyn, NY}8}14}0}-1}5}11/13/2011}The food is simply amazing. Pricey, sure, but you certainly get what you pay for. Every single dish is expertly prepared and presented and the array of saki available is more than one can take in. Must try dishes are the tuna tartare, eggplant with miso & filet of beef on a hot stone.
Phil s.}San Mateo, CA}14}42}1}-1}4}11/10/2011}Had a great experience here tonight -  food and saki were great.Our server was fantastic, responsive and always there to steer us in the right direction.  Let's start with the drinks - Our server was a big help, we described what we liked and did not like - She brought us out two bottles and let us try it and then we chose the ones we liked (we did this two times so got a chance to try out four kinds of sake).Food - Delicious, the sashimi was amazing, the soba noodles with uni & uni sauce was great, beef tataki - awesome, pork belly - yum, the reason why i only gave four stars, one of the specials was a snow crab with rice item - it was only ok.Overall, would recommend - it is pricey but what isn't in NYC.
David R.}Brooklyn, NY}184}16}0}-1}4}11/10/2011}Fantastic and reasonable Japanese food (not really any standard sushi on the menu) two blocks from Grand Central.  Expansive sake menu.  Great atmosphere.  Authentic Japanese ... bathrooms.
Chris C.}Chicago, IL}184}90}14}-1}4}11/9/2011}Omg one if the best traditional japanese restaurants. Try the gyusuji it will change your life. Black sesame crembrule. I love it!
Simon S.}Manhattan, NY}2}15}0}-1}4}11/9/2011}The interior décor spirits you away to Japan and the food is very good. Good place to go if you are a sake fan as well. The price however will return you to NY very quickly. It is quite pricey but overall I enjoyed it and will probably come back soon.
Patrik D.}Sweden}25}371}9}-1}2}11/7/2011}a hidden spot, in a boring area of New York.Staff really friendly. we chooses some disches and asked waiter for some advice of more disches. She recommended only the most expensive courses, we chooses her advices.To be honest the disches that she recommend was out of taste and very boring and expensiveThe courses the we chooses was by our selves OK, but i think this place is def not worth such good reviews, try Ippudo instead so much better.We left the place without any tip! thats what happen when you fool vikings from the North!!!
Jack L.}Queens, NY}3}38}0}-1}5}11/6/2011}Excellent restaurant for soba noodles. I come here every so often for lunch and order from the soba gozen lunch platters. The soba noodles are amazing and even the wasabi is superior to the norm. Definitely recommend this as a regular dining spot
Steve F.}Singapore, Singapore}2}68}0}-1}5}11/2/2011}Big fun.  This place I really love, though it's got the special appeal of being a go-to spot for people coming into Grand Central Terminal.  But good prices, great food and drink,  (not suggesting their special, expensive evenings unless someone is taking you there...), and excellent sake.  One of my favorite places in the City.
Food_Lover A.}New York, NY}26}150}0}-1}3}10/27/2011Updatedreview}Ok, this is the third time I write about this place :) I think I've made up my mind. It was ok..nothing special but not bad either.             One complain tho, everytime I called to make reso. They always said the place was booked until 9 or 10; but when I went (walked in), it was always empty or at least plenty of table available.
Mark L.}Long Island City, NY}1}18}3}-1}5}10/25/2011}Fantastic Experience! Lunch here was a welcomed respite from the chaos of midday midtown Manhattan! The staff is super friendly and professional. The menu is varied and creative with a slight flair for drama. The setting is authentic and fun. If you have the opportunity treat yourself to Saka Gura. It's a treat that offers value and excitement...
Avi A.}Manhattan, NY}447}58}82}-1}5}10/24/2011}If you've ever wondered what it's like living in Japan, you might want to make a trip over to Sakagura in Midtown New York. Granted, you won't see the demographic of Tokyo, but it's pretty damn close. The authenticity of this place reminds me of a cozy japanese ramen house with an encyclopedic array of sake to choose from. It's interesting to note the different flavors on the menu, inspired both by authentic Japanese fare to more modern and Western takes on the classic dishes you might see in a Japanese home (a wealthy one). And then with a neat finish, the restaurant serves "tapas" style dishes so you could share with the whole crew. If you do decide to go, you absolutely need to capitalize on the entire menu by taking a holistic approach. Try the Kamo Roast (duck wrapped scallions) and then maybe have a little Gyu Miso Nigomi (miso ribs). Move on to the Yuba Shumai (pork dumplings) and finish with their homemad Nihachi Soba. As always, with japanese food, it never weighs you down. Get yo drank on with a nice carafe of sake (waiter/waitress can recommend which one) and end up wishing you were born in Japan :)Of course, it'll never be as good as the real thing... but for a restaurant that even has a robotic toilet.. it's well worth the trip. Enjoy!5/5
Kevin W.}Manhattan, NY}45}548}18}-1}4}10/24/2011}Great place to go if you're looking for Japanese tapas and want a slightly more upscale or mature environment versus the places on St Marks and you want more than just yakitori skewers.We drank a bunch of excellent cold sake from an extensive list. Stand out dishes included the stewed beef tongue, the grilled beef tongue skewers, the duck (though it is a cold dish and had a slight liver flavor hint to me somehow), the egg stews (Chawan Mushi - more silky than other egg stews, almost like a soon doo boo chigae silkiness).  Assorted sashimi was also awesome - especially the uni, subtle and yum.  Rice balls were not grilled, so not as interesting to me (they won't bring you just a bowl of rice for some retarded reason).  The beef slices to cook at table on hot stone was fun but not mind blowing in flavor like the tongues.  I believe I also had the Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg with uni and roe in cold soup) and I slurped it down - yummy. Good spot for groups to share Japanese tapas, you can make reservations, and it doesn't feel cramped.
Calvin W.}Brooklyn, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}10/22/2011}This place is truly amazing. It's well hidden; you won't find it unless you're looking for it. It's a great place to take a date if you they like Japanese food and a sense of adventure. They bring you hot towels before you start your meal as well as a hot cup of tea when you finish. They do not rush or pressure you as you eat and always keep your water glass filled. The food is also great. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is going to eat in NYC.
David H.}Plano, TX}0}7}0}-1}5}10/15/2011}Like the Wardrobe was a portal to Narnia, this unassuming staircase to the basement is a portal to Japan. I will spend many nights dreaming of the Braised Pork Belly that is their signature dish.  Words cannot describe its wonder.  Their desserts were fabulous as well!
Jasmine T.}Saint Louis, MO}7}52}21}-1}4}10/12/2011}Lovely, lovely, lovely. 5 of us went here last week and had a great time. the atmosphere is very zen and calming, even though the space is not huge. We ordered a ton of things from the menu, these were the highlights:- maguro natto - fermented beans, if you can get past the smell and add lot of wasabi, this was good- hirami ponzu - best fluke sashimi ive ever had and the presentation was great- grilled japanese eggplants - yumazing and very different tasting- pork belly - i dont eat pork, but this was DELICIOUS and my friends were kind enought to let me try and then share:)- dessert - the special was amazing and now am desperately seeking japanese crackers, the server told us that you can only get them in japan- sake - amazing selection fo sake, we did splurge and get a 200 dollar bottle, totally worth it. overall, a great meal, service was spotty but when we had his attention, he was great. cannot wait to go again.
Alissa C.}Brooklyn, NY}0}37}0}-1}4}10/11/2011}I love this place and have been going here for years now. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I think the food has gone a little downhill since the "mainstream" discovered this hidden spot. The sake selection has to be one of the best in NY and the atmosphere is so Japan. Service is excellent and I love taking friends from out of town here--it's hard to be disappointed with any part of the experience.
Aryn B.}Manhattan, NY}130}6}0}-1}5}10/11/2011}Everything about this place is amazing! The decor is fabulous, the servers are extremely sweet and on point, and the food is some of the best Japanese I've had. Don't be turned off by the fusion aspect of the menu, everything is fresh and wonderful. Pure, simple ingredients. I've eaten here with a small group a few times and tried a pretty large portion of the menu and everything has been terrific--they have fresh-made tofu!  The black sesame creme brulee and earl grey ice cream are worth a trip alone.
Claire O.}New York, NY}1}119}1}-1}5}10/10/2011}I just went to Japan this summer and fell in love with it -- when Manhattan gets overwhelming, Sakagura is my secret getaway, like a portal back into some hidden Kyoto izakaya.  But it's no good hiding it, because despite its basement quarters, the secret is obviously out about Sakagura -- all I can do is add to the chorus of fans.   In 3 visits, I haven't had a single disappointment from the menu, but some of my favorites are:- the salmon/ikura donburi -- salmon sashimi and ikura on rice.  it sounds so simple, but it's so sublime.  Their ikura are super-fresh and somehow more savory than your usual run-of-the-mill ikura, and the rice is fluffy perfection.- beef grilled on a hot stone -- again, simple, but so much fun - black sesame creme brulee -- heaven in a ramekin.  the black sesame is freshly ground, the creme brulee is perfectly executed, and they make their own black sesame ice-cream as a topping (toasty black sesame paste swirled into vanilla ice-cream, which gives it more punch)All this bliss doesn't come cheap -- dinner there runs around $90 for two people (without drinks -- and their sake menu is so extensive that you may find it hard to resist temptation).  But their lunch menu is huge (if not quite as extensive); I had an excellent set lunch there for $15, and it was so much food I couldn't finish it and barely needed to eat dinner.
Lina F.}South Slope, Brooklyn, NY}142}295}507}18}4}10/9/2011}Sakagura definitely takes you back to Japan with the "Irasshaimase" greetings!  Everyone at the restaurant says it very loudly!  I came here for dinner and it was quite pricey ($155 for two or $60 pp omokasa) If you make reservations for 4 or more, you are accommodated with a private room.  Otherwise, you are like me and are seated by the grilling station which isnt that all bad.  Your clothes do stink, but it's worth it!Sakagura is Japanese tapas.  Their menu is always changing, but we had ordered : octupus with cucumbers in kimchi sauce, cold tofu (amazing),  monk fish liver, and fried organic chicken (so crispy).  I recommend being adventurous and sampling a little bit of everything.  If you aren't too sure, ask your server as ours was extremely informative.  I also suggest getting their house special which takes 40 minutes to make - their stone pot rice dish with anything toppings.  We got eel with ours and it was delicious.  Others ordered sashimi, but you can get that anywhere.There sake and desserts were outstanding (pumpkin cheese cake and fire creme brulee).Enjoy the experience and definitely give the bathroom a shot!  It's electric toilet seat in the ladies room is quite exciting.
Julia W.}New York, NY}12}10}0}-1}5}10/6/2011}This place was fabulous! On a friends recommendation we went here last night and it was great meal. The first thing stand out point is how deceiving the entry to the restaurant is. Such a pleasant surprise to walk into the restaurant. A great example of what creativity can do with a space. We ate at the bar, which is always my favorite palce, but the rest of the tables looked really nice too. They don't serve "sushi" but there were several sashimi options on the menu. Try the chicken meatballs!! Great Sake selection too. Will definitely be back.
Tran T.}Long Island, NY}149}144}90}18}4}10/4/2011}4.5 starsI must have walked by this place a million times before realizing that it's within the basement of a building. I was little wearry walking down the dark stairway to get to the restaurant, but once you step inside, you're transported to what seems like a Japanese oasis... almost makes you feel like you're really in Japan. The tapas here are amazing and unique. I have ordered so many things off the menu that I cannot account for them all, but I remember that they left quite a great impression! The sake here is insane. They must house upwards towards a hundred different kinds or maybe even more. The service is superbly fluid! They bring out your tapas one at a time and are so precise... as soon as you are finished with one plate, they whisk it away and like magic your next treats are in front of you. Everything here from the decor to service is excellent. It can get a little pricey and you may leave feeling a little hungry, but it's definitely worth a trip for the overall experience and quality of food. I highly recommend this hidden treasure if you want to impress a date or group of friends. Reservations are recommended!
Dimitri S.}New York, NY}59}221}320}-1}5}9/29/2011}Nice underground setting, umami taste bud teasing sashimi.  Deep, loving flavors in the broth in both the pork belly and the beef tongue dishes.  Grilled squid was seasoned perfectly.  Crisp salad with seaweed and sesame dressing was refreshing.  Agedashi tofu was as good as I have experienced.  Clean flavorful sake.  Professional and attentive service.  Was a wonderful gastronomic tour of Japanese cooking.  I'll be back for sure.
Wendee M.}Brooklyn, NY}261}187}31}-1}4}9/28/2011}A friend recommended this place after she had what she claims to be the best souffle in all of New York. It was pretty darn good!Service was good, staff was friendly. The bathrooms were awesome! (you'll see what I mean). The only bad thing was that the table was too tiny when they served everything on giant plates! HAHA. Try the beef tongue and the waitress' recommendation of the most expensive sake. LOL ... never again. I do not know how to savor it so I gulped it. There goes $40 for 1/3 of a glass! I will definitely go back for the food, and souffle =)
Samantha P.}New York, NY}117}136}27}-1}4}9/26/2011}You'd think that midtown east, what with it's lavish New American power lunch/dinner institutions, wouldn't be able to sustain an eclectic place like Sakagura, but it does! I chose this restaurant because I have a friend on the UES, and I'm in Hells Kitchen, so this is our ideal meeting place. Additionally, Sakagura has a lot of pescatarian options, which is a requirement for my kosher dining partner. You should also know that this place is in the basement of an office building, and that there is another Japanese restaurant next door, so meeting up can be confusing because one is inclined to step into the Japanese store-front next door. Sakagura in all it's saki-induced splendor is through a neon-lit lobby, past the front desk, and down a flight of service stairs. You are then greeted by a MASSIVE dimly-lit basement with large wooden dining enclaves, cherry blossoms and fusuma (paper japanese doors). The juxtaposition of office to saki den is enough to make a visit worthwhile.For dinner we shared a few of the all-tapas menu including Maguro Tartar (chopped tuna with frying fish roe steeped in yuzu and caviar) and hirame ponzu (Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette). All was lite and refreshing and well-executed.
Anders B.}Manhattan, NY}0}57}0}-1}4}9/22/2011}Who doesn't like walking down into the basement of a commercial building through a doorway to Japan? Amazingly fresh, vibrantly-flavorful traditional, Japanese food. Thorough Sake list and interesting decor make this place a winner. The Uni Soba was quite special and if you're up for dessert, definitely try the black sesame creme brulee.
Angela L.}PECK SLIP, NY}0}14}0}-1}1}9/20/2011}After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try, well.. bad choice.. The food was ok, but I have to say after having a $50 meal walking out the restaurant half full, then having diarrhea all night long was really a big big turn off for me. I do have a very sensitive stomach, but if the food were all fresh, I wouldn't had a reaction like that. Disappointed.
Yukie P.}Oceanside, NY}18}122}172}-1}5}9/20/2011}Went to Sakagura for lunch while Mom was in town. Their lunch specials are wonderful with varieties of food including soba, tempura, sashimi, etc. Mom ordered the lunch tasting menu, and was very impressed with what she got for $30! I had their signature soba and sashimi set. Delicious! Will definitely go back and try dinner!
Stefanos M.}San Francisco, CA}64}84}7}-1}4}9/19/2011}This is a very unique place.  As you've read in others' reviews, its in the basement of an office building.  During dinner/late night hours the place is crawling with Japanese business men and feels like you've taken a trip to Tokyo.  Lunch is typical mid-town working crowd (not as cool).They have a very extensive sake menu and visiting this place really made me truly appreciate sake beyond my sake bomb exposure.  Unfiltered sake is amazing!  Like mothers milk.For dinner I got a bunch of sushi.  All their fish is very fresh.  I also gave sea urchin another chance...still cant do it.For lunch I've had their lunch special a few times, $30 tower of food.  Pretty good, but their chocolate molten cake for desert is the best part.
Tamara H.}Manhattan, NY}115}333}273}18}5}9/16/2011}Went for my bday and Loved it ! :) menu has a lot of options, all delicious.
Little C.}Brooklyn, NY}108}134}0}-1}5}9/14/2011}It's rare that I'm hanging in this neighbourhood so I don't go to this restaurant as much as I probably should...The basement of an office building seems an unlikely place to find such a nice restaurant with such delicious food. I've enjoyed everything I've sampled off the menu - oddly something that really stands out in my memory is the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert.
Shane D.}Jasper, GA}9}24}4}-1}5}9/13/2011}I read about this place on Yelp and after being intrigued by this "hidden gem", I set out on a quest to find it.  It took a while to find, but it was definitely worth it.  In a nondescript building down a dimly lit staircase, I found some of the best Japanese food outside of Tokyo.  After being promptly seated (arrived early around 7:00 on a Mon), I decided to go with the Buckwheat Soba and Crispy Fried Chicken.  I know this place has any kind of Sake that you would like (with beautiful presentation of said Sake to boot).  However, I was in a beerish mood, so I had Sapporo instead.  The food was FANTASTIC.  The Soba were simple, yet eloquent and perfectly textured.  Someone there really knows what they are doing.  The chicken was perfectly prepared, period.  To finish my meal, I had the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, which was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life.  All in all, the quality of the food at Sakagura almost makes me want to move to NYC by itself.  There is a reason that this place can stay hidden and still do great business.  It's definitely worth seeking out.  It is just that good.
Gerry P.}Brooklyn, NY}5}101}38}-1}5}9/8/2011}Every bit the dream come true, in a delightfully secreted location. Entering Sakagura is like entering another world, aesthetically, mentally, spiritually, and of course culinarily (and yes, I realize that's not a real word).
Catherine F.}Tuckahoe, NY}0}2}0}-1}5}8/24/2011}Loooove this place so much, I go there at least once a month to eat lunch and I never leave unhappy.  Try their desserts too, delicious!
Mary Jane K.}Santa Clara, CA}16}40}5}-1}5}8/23/2011}We were visiting NYC with our cousins and wanted some yummy japanese, didn't know where to go so the 4 of us started to yelp, and finally after a long hour of going back and forth and being indecisive my boyfriend says "we going to Sakagura"! We were so happy that someone decided. YAY, Japanese!!! We came to this restaurant, as we were directed to walk down the basement, it felt sketchy but when we stepped into the restaurant everything changed, the decor reminded us of Japan, the smell just brought happiness to our faces and the sound of people eating and chatting just made us feel safe and that we had made a good choice!  we didn't make an appointment, so we waited for 20 mins and when we sat down and the food came, then the sake. Wow, every dish we got just blew us away, the duck, the pork, the sashimi but I especially loved the uni soup with the poached egg. AND then there was desert, I love black sesame  and their blk sesame creme brulee topped with more black sesame ice cream was ridiculously good.!. Well done boyfriend! I can't wait to come back this fall! :)
Jen I.}Manhattan, NY}0}56}0}-1}3}8/19/2011}When we decided on Sakagura, my bf remembered it really good from the past and I saw they got 4 stars so we took our out-of-towner friends here. We ordered numerous amounts of plates, love that they're tapas style however they aren't very tasteful. There was nothing that we ordered that was "GREAT."Other than that, the sake we ordered was DELICIOUS.Noticed that more tourists come here more than authentic Japanese people.
Michael S.}New York, NY}5}15}0}-1}4}8/18/2011}Sakagura is consistently good. I can imagine the restaurant having a finely tuned kitchen akin to a kaizen toyota car factory.... never had a bad dish there.P.S. Stewed beef tongue is delicious.
Rhianna K.}South Orange, NJ}10}11}0}-1}5}8/17/2011}Some colleagues first took me to Sakagura to celebrate the end of a difficult negotiating period at the United Nations. I failed to see the small sign in front of the building, and when they led me down some cellar stairs behind the elevator, I joked: "Are you guys taking me somewhere to kill me or feed me?" They responded: "Wait, when we open this cellar door you will be transported to Tokyo." And indeed I was transported to the most eye-opening, amazing Japanese dinner I have had this side of the world. We paired up every amazing dish with the sake recommended by the knowledgable staff, and nary a sushi roll was to be found. It is the most authentic, creative and inspiring meals around. I've since dubbed it "Secret Japanese Place". The lunches are affordable (if you can afford the wait for a table!) and while the dinners can creep up there in price, it is always worth it.
Asuka N.}New York, NY}345}1459}0}18}4}8/14/2011}My girlfriend and I came here for dinner last weekend. It can be a little hard to find right off - you have to walk into a building entrance first and then go down the stairs into the basement. We had to wait about 5 minutes after the specified 6 PM opening time until they actually popped it open, but they've done a very nice job with the ambiance despite the underground location. We got seated reasonably quickly, although I question why it was so hard to get a reservation...even by the time we had left, the place still seemed roughly half-empty. Service was decent - nothing fantastic, but the food came out quickly.As for the food itself: everything we had was delicious, but I wouldn't put it above Momokawa, which is my current favorite spot for all-around traditional Japanese food. To be fair, the sake menu here is prodigiously large, but not being a big sake drinker, I can't really pass judgment on it. The dishes were all delicious, with the highlights being the deep-fried curried pork - the flavor was fantastic, and the curry added a nice little hint of space to what would ordinarily be a relatively plain dish. The beef cooked on the stone was a cool experience, and it was very tender - but not as flavorful as I would've imagined, and probably not worth the $20 given the amount of meat (it's more for the experience). The other noteworthy dish was the uzaku - the eel was very fresh and paired very well with the lightly dressed veggies. Dessert was amazing - even though I've been to other restaurants (ahem, Max Brenner's) that have more of a focus on chocolate, the souffle here was fantastic - the perfect consistency without being too light or too cake-y. The creme brulee with black sesame ice cream was a very unique taste on its own, but it tasted amazing.All in all, I'd definitely come back here again. I wouldn't call it my top choice for true Japanese food, but they do have a wide selection of very, very good food. A fantastic place to dine for sure!
Lena Z.}Flushing, NY}18}60}25}-1}5}8/14/2011}Service: excellent, polite, informative about dishes to make sure customer knows what they are getting.Food: very fresh seafood. Everything was delicious, pricey but worth the money.Atmosphere: very unique very nice for a date.  Definitely, will go back because authentic japanese food is delicious and healthy.
Dorim L.}Chicago, IL}103}546}3}-1}5}8/11/2011}Wow, the food was phenomenal!A bunch of my friends and I had dinner at Sakaguru, we ordered a variety of small plates and everything was delicious down to white rice.  The rice balls were excellent as well as the fried chicken and beef.  The most favorite dish I had?  Chuwanmushi!  Wow, it was an egg steamed to perfection with salty sauce on top and seafood inside.  The consistency was so smooth and all the ingredients fresh.  I fell in love with this dish and it was worth every penny.  Their service could use some improvements - one of the waiter had an attitude problem.  Other than that, you must search for this place and eat their food.
Niles R.}Long Island City, NY}29}26}23}-1}5}8/6/2011}This is quite possibly the best Japanese food I've ever eaten nay best. food. ever.
Marjorie W.}Brooklyn, NY}174}206}57}18}5}7/30/2011}Absolutely one of the best meals I've ever had. Everything was delicious. I would happily return, over and over again.
Gina T.}Brooklyn, NY}3}5}0}-1}4}7/30/2011}Stepping into this place is sort of like teleporting to Tokyo. Partially because it's in the basement and partially because of the decor. The onsen tamago with uni is delicious, but in general it's a bit pricey and I've left hungry on a couple of occasions.If you're in the Grand Central area around lunch, the soba set or the bento are really good. The quality and presentation make it worth it.
Katie S.}New York, NY}12}26}1}-1}4}7/21/2011}I will come back again here. Cool Japanese tapas bar, nice speakeasy atmosphere. Everything is arranged beautifully, from ceiling to floor, especially food. Taste great, too. Can be hard to get a table if walk in without reservation.
Mona W.}Santa Clara, CA}1359}1261}9631}18}4}7/20/2011}It is not exactly easy to define what Sakagura is. As its Japanese name suggested, their specialty is sake. It is an excellent sake bar that offers a wide range of premium quality sake. That is not the only thing Sakagura excels at. The food here is not shy at all in comparison to their sake selection. Lunch format is similar to a teishoku-ya, the focus is business set lunch. They also have a very competitively priced daily lunch special. Dinner format is izakaya style, mainly small dishes to go with your sake. I came here for lunch. Ordered the chef tasting lunch menu and yakizakana gozen (grilled fish lunch set). The preparation and presentation are very authentic. This place reminded me so much of Tokyo I almost forgot I was in the heart of NYC. The food was good. I was most impressed with their handmade soba. The texture is quite perfect. Both hot and cold style were excellent. Their tsukemono and sunomono (pickled/seasoned vegetable side dishes) are great as well. Their homemade desserts looked really amazing and I had a hard time picking. Black sesame creme brulee was my first choice but unfortunately they ran out that day. Ordered chocolate souffle and sake manju instead and was not disappointed. The souffle was one of the nicer ones I have had. The chocolate flavor is rich but not overly sweet. Sake Manju was lovely. Their homemade ice cream has good creamy texture but the sorbet is a bit too icy. The ambiance is quite formal. The restaurant definitely tailored towards the business crowd. Tables fill up really fast since this is a local's favorite. Reservation is almost a must. Lastly, do not expect to find sushi here just because it is a Japanese restaurant.
lady m.}Brooklyn, NY}0}6}0}-1}5}7/20/2011}My favorite Japanese authentic restaurant.  it's delicious. i love LOVE the food here. it is fantastic.  all the dishes are to die for. my absolute fav is the organic poached chicken egg with uni in the cold broth.  i forget what it is called but so delicious.
Andreas H.}Seattle, WA}1059}1130}46}18}4}7/18/2011}Finding this gem took a little work, but I am so glad we finally came here for lunch.  The underground cave feel was mitigated by the lively decor and heavy use of bamboo.For an appetizer I had the Tsukune - moist little balls of ground chicken covered in a delightfully tangy teriyaki glaze.  My main course, the Oyako Don, reminded me of chicken stew.  There were so many things on the menu, I didn't know what to order.  I also sampled my wife's seaweed salad with Ponzu dressing, which had some really crazy textured seaweed in the mix.What I wasn't expecting was the gargantuan servings.  My Oyako Don could have fed two people.  I made it about a third way through before I waved the white flag.  I'll keep that in mind the next time we visit, which will be very soon.Hooray for Sakagura!
Jocelyn E.}Sammamish, WA}117}270}0}-1}5}7/17/2011}Attempting to find another tapas place I had stumbled upon in Midtown a while back, we typed in "tapas" and "Midtown" - and found Sakagura.  Thanks fellow Yelpers - without your directions, we would never have found this place just walking around.  Honestly, we were a little hesitant wandering into the office building and down into the basement (as there aren't a lot of signs pointing you in the right direction, we actually thought that maybe we had gone in the wrong building).  This place is amazingly done though.  The décor - you would not know that you were in a basement.  In Midtown.We got here "early" (at around 6) on a Tuesday evening without reservations.  The hostess seemed a little in shock "NO reservation?!" and seated us as long as we promised to be done by 8:15 as there was a reserved table.  Almost every single table had a reserved sign on it in the area that we had been seated, and by the time we left at 8, the whole back area was complete full.  If you're planning on coming here with a big group after 7, I highly recommend making a reservation.  Dishes here are small, which is great because you get a lot of great variety.  The waitress told us that typically people order 2-3 dishes per person for a full meal; we ended up with 4 dishes each plus dessert before we were ready to call it a night.  Some dishes are slightly bigger than others.  I recommend ordering a handful of things and keeping a menu on hand to order more if you're still hungry.  We really enjoyed everything we ate here, especially the dessert: black sesame crème brule.  It's not a cheap dessert, but it is really, really good.  The service is really great here.  Our waitress was amazing as was the other wait staff.  Our table was bussed immediately after our dishes went empty, but we never felt like we were being rushed (despite having a "deadline" for having to get out!).  Our waitress either served us or was supervising the serving from a distance.  The one time we were accidentally served the wrong dish, she came by and took care of the mistake right away before I had time to poke and ask my hubby what he had ordered.  I think given the location and quality of food and service, this place is worth every dime.  For our 9 items + beer, our bill came to around $120 before tip.  If you're looking for good Japanese and you're in the neighborhood, stop by this gem.
Peter F.}Brooklyn, NY}1}40}0}-1}5}7/16/2011}This place was great.  Total surprise.  Just make sure you walk thru the lobby of 211 and don't go to the place next door, which we almost did. Walked down and thought I was going into a bomb shelter.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.  Great ambiance.  Felt like I had just uncovered this great hidden surprise in NYC. Esp since I worked 3 blocks away for 4 yrs and never knew about it.  Had a variety of dishes and sakes.  All was great.  Fish - black cod and fluke were esp. great.  But also steak and pork belly are must haves.  Total find and total surprise.  Lots of fun.
Samuel M.}Manhattan, NY}64}404}44}-1}4}7/14/2011Updatedreview}Sakagura is a hidden paradise, a jewel, a diamond. It is an exotic place, with the best sake selection in New York. Is more a sake bar than a restaurant, the dishes are made to be shared with friends and sake.   I've been there more than 6 times, 4 times i ended very drunk, so be careful with the sake. The first time i couldn't walk straight and yesterday i was walking in zig zag. I treat sake like wine and sake is much stronger. Beware with what you order, some flavors can be very strong   The Hirame Ponzu (Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi), is one of my favorites, the ponzu flavor rocks.   Maguro Natto: (Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Fermented Soy Beans) is too strong, that fermented soy is to be careful.   The 5 kinds of assorted sashimi, melts in your mouth like butter. You can change the sea urchin for salmon. I find sea urchin too strong. As good as it gets!   The Ebi Stick (Deep fried Srimp Roll) is good, not to repeat it but once in a while is ok.   I used Sakagura as a restaurant, i just discovered that is better as a sake bar, to hear the jazz, drink a few glasses. The jazz is very classic, like 70's jazz.   $200, pricey but not bad. $75 the bottle of sake, the waiters will always recommend you the most expensive one, so decide what you want to spend  without pressure.   I will definitely go back. This is my neighborhood restaurant. i was a bit disappointed of Sakagura, but yesterday they demonstrated their essence   One of the best sashimi in town, sashimi gourmet.
Chase S.}Quincy, MA}53}51}4}-1}4}7/10/2011}Hi there, I'm the guy you hired to be your guide for Sakagura. I'm not much to look at, but do you want the guy with the rock hard abs and chiseled jawline bringing all of you in and only half of you out? Or do you want my ugly mug to show you the way and make sure you're around to celebrate another one of your kids birthdays? Pleasure meeting you.Sakagura is a hidden paradise of dinery and I'm one of the few who've managed to find out that it actually exists, the building it's hidden under, and the path through the Maze of Hallways and false doorways inside. It's hard to find because there's only a tiny sign out front and you'll NEVER guess where it is in the building, but I'll get you there.But before we begin our journey, a word of warning: Know what you want to order. Do your homework. The sake is top-notch. If you're a veteran, you'll know the rice entrees are delicious and homemade noodle items will save you from hunger. The desserts, however, are the treasure trove that all the secrecy and inconspicuousness of this facility protect. Everything else in the menu is just a highly flavorful and pretty diversion. The chefs release their food less frequently than over-protective fathers release their daughters into the wild. Items ordered can be served with 15-20 minute gaps in between so be aware that if you weren't hungry when you got there, you will be. Oh you will be.Ok, let's head out.
Kate F.}Houston, TX}1}475}15}-1}5}7/9/2011}the best japanese food (non-sushi) i've ever had. thought they do have some sashimi options, it was great to experience something new. a really extensive sake list, wonderful staff, and the price is right ... a perfect place for a fancy/adventurous date!
Alice C.}San Francisco, CA}218}453}91}-1}4}7/8/2011}I took my boyfriend to Bohemian on his birthday, so he took me here on mine. Hidden Japanese spots with fancy Japanese toilets appears to be the random theme.. hmmmAtmosphere and food here are completely different from Bohemian though, so no real comparison. This cute izakaya-type place is tucked away in the basement level of a random midtown office building, which is neat.Food was undoubtedly good and filling. Of the items we ordered, these are the ones I enjoyed:- Kamo roast (chilled roasted duck slices wrapped around scallion)- very tasty, especially if you love duck- Tori karaage (deep fried chicken chunks)- deep fried chicken, what's not to love- Gyu miso nikomi (stewed beef back ribs)- very tender meat, yum- Onigiri (rice balls- we ordered it with takana leaves and salmon roe)- originally thought this would just be filler for our meal, but I ended up enjoying it a lot, especially the takana leaves- Buta kakuni (stewed diced pork)- tender, large fatty chunk mmmItems that you might want to pass on:- Jaga dango (mashed potatoes fried in sweet donut batter)- sounds like it would be good, but sub par in reality; the fried part kinda overwhelms the tasteless potatoes- Chawanmushi- I usually love steamed egg, and this one was good, just not great- Homemade nihachi soba (soba on a bed of ice, served with dipping sauce)- definitely want to pass on this, unless you love soba; it just felt very plain to meI didn't really want any more alcohol, so we passed on the sake, even though the sake selection is very extensive.The downside was that the service was very iffy. Our reservation was at 9:30, but we were seated closer to 10pm even though the restaurant didn't seem too busy. Also, after we ordered, we asked the waiter if this was enough food for two, and he said something like "EH.. maybe..." but it was DEFINITELY enough. The boyfriend and I were stuffed by the end and had to pass on dessert, unfortunately. And when we wanted to take some food to go, there seemed to be an issue with that.. so odd.Food is served quickly though. I went to the bathroom after placing our order, and food was already on the table after I got back from only playing with the toilet briefly, haha.
Subin K.}Manhattan, NY}8}6}0}-1}5}7/6/2011}Came here with my boyfriend a couple of days ago and it was definitely the most legit meal we had all weekend. We went July 4th so it was pretty quiet but I can imagine it being a restaurant filled with tons of Japanese people on regular weeknights. It's in the basement of an office building and the walk down the stairs and such is quite sketchy, which shows all the more that the restaurant has to only show for pure quality in its food. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and gave us a heads up about certain dishes we ordered such as the tuna sashimi in grated mountain yam (kind of sticky paste that we were not ready for), and other things. He also gave us great recommendations for a sake list that is intimidatingly long. A couple of the servers explained our dishes while others did not. All in all, it was a very quiet and peaceful meal and the food was solid.The braised pork belly, yum. Sashimi with daikon radish, great. Sake berry, awesome.
Francesc C.}Manhattan, NY}0}3}0}-1}4}7/4/2011}Now this is the sort of Japanese joint you recommend to a dignitary visiting town, it's fun, it caughts you off guard, the food is pretty decent, and the sake list is mind bogging. A good place to keep in mind. Not too expensive and relaxed.
C. N.}Geneva, Switzerland}1}19}23}-1}5}7/4/2011}Been here at least 5 times, always satisfied; refined cooking, great selection of sakes ( literally the "sake cellar", Ichinokura Himezen and Kakurei, yay! )Food (5/5) daily special soba set for a quick lunch and tasting menu for a slow lunch ~ dinner time star dishes (izakaya-like small dishes): a. kamo roast - tenderly roasted duck b. jidori shioyaki - tenderly (again) grilled chicken, dip it in the aromatic yuzu saucec. gyutan - tender (yes, tender) beef tongue stewd. chawanmushi - tender (...) egg custard steamed in a cute cup filled with bite-sized goodies including a ginkgo nute. others: grilled squid, firefly squid, inaniwa udon ( silky smooth for a change ), ochazuke, assorted sashimi, black sesame crème brûlée and sake manju or soba bun with matcha ice cream to finish, and certainly sake sakeAmbience (4.5/5) intimate, carefully decorated with a relaxed courtyard feeling, very cute bathroomsService (4.5/5) nice staff, always make reservations though sometimes you may obtain only 1hr window at the bar during peak hrs
Melissa W.}San Francisco, CA}7}16}0}-1}5}6/27/2011}Delicious, authentic Japanese food! It reminded me of tapas style Japanese food with tasty small portions. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. Service was attentive and the decor was great. Also, be sure to check out the toilet in the washrooms!
Janine C.}Manhattan, NY}124}139}33}-1}5}6/24/2011}Saka Gura is a hidden gem. Quite literally. It is located in the basement of what appears to be an office or apartment building. Only a discrete sign outdoors marks its subterranean presence. Walk in, make a left and head down the stairs to arrive at a very authentic japanese restaurant that serves unique japanese tapas and extraordinary, almost surprising desserts.The restaurant is dimly lit, mid-sized and has intimate booths that seat parties of four. The staff is very helpful and was patient as we tried to determine what to order from the wide-selection of dishes available.  Our waitress gave us excellent Sake recommendations. We opted for the following:-Tofu Salad: By far my favorite savory dish of the evening. The tofu was so soft it verged on creamy. Coupled with the crisp greens and the citrusy carrot dressing, the outcome was refreshing and a perfect way to open the meal.-Duck with scallions and some delicious green sauce: The duck was cooked perfectly. My only qualm was the sliver of fat that didn't go down very nicely, but it's duck...it's fatty, I'm just a pansy when it comes to these things. Very good combination of the tender duck with the crunch of the scallions.-Grilled japanese eggplant with misos: The eggplant was very soft and the misos were such interesting additions to the vegetable. I love that the eggplant was grilled. It added a nice smoky element to the dish.-Beef slices with daikon: The meat was very lightly cooked and topped with a lovely mixture of daikon and a dark sauce. Beautiful presentation.-Shumai: This was the only disappointment of the meal. I was underwhelmed by the shumai which resembled more of a shrimp meatball than shumai. Perhaps because my expectations weren't met, I wasn't able to enjoy the shumai. -Buckwheat soba with shrimp: I love soba. It is so simple and almost cleansing. There was nothing extraordinary about this dish, but it hit the spot. The shrimp gave a nice punch to the ensemble.-Sesame Creme Brulee: This was an outstanding dessert. I have never seen or tasted anything like it and would have no idea to make something like this. It's nice to indulge in things you know you cannot make at home! The taste was complex and layered. It carried a faint peanut-buttery flavor and a decisive sesame undertone--so unique! I would absolutely recommend trying this dessert.-Coffee Jello: Another very interesting dessert. Although it was unusual and pleasing, I am not a fan of the texture of jello, so I mostly focused on the creme brulee!-Strawberry sorbet: This was exquisite. Very simple and refreshing with very strong strawberry flavors.Overall, this was an excellent meal featuring bold culinary choices. It ran us around $200, which is pricey but not bad to feed three at a fine dining establishment. If you're up for some non-run of the mill Japanese food, head to Saka Gura!!
Chris P.}New York, NY}148}19}0}-1}5}6/23/2011}The soba lunch is amazing    and the bites for dinner are delicious    every meal is different
Tiffany T.}Los Angeles, CA}172}69}10}-1}5}6/22/2011}Came here on a brief NYC trip. Let's just say Sakagura plays a HUGE part in me wanting to move to the city.Poached egg floating on a bed of uni and salmon caviar. Summer set sashimi with fat, moist slices of tuna belly and uni, glistening in the light. Deep fried taro balls swimming in sauce and bonito flakes. Light-as-air wisps of potato fried in doughnut dough. A melty chocolate souffle that imploded on touch. I want my last meal to be from here. It was all so, so good. Indescribably so.
Steven L.}New York, NY}11}41}1}-1}2}6/21/2011}This place was not good. Maybe it was because of what I ordered, or the atmosphere (reminded me of TV set for a japanese restaurant), but I walked out highly disappointed in Yelp NYC. Ordered:TAMAGOYAKITATAMI IWASHIUZAKUBUTA KAKUNITORI TSUKUNEBaked crab rice specialUni soba specialBasically, I wouldn't order any of these dishes again. The crab rice was ok since it included large pieces of crab meat, and was delicate in flavor but not worth the price. The pork belly was good, but I would suggest ordering 1 piece per 2 people. I echo other negative reviews by saying the price did not match the quality of food. If you're looking for izakaya-type food, I would recommend Hagi or Yakitori Totto (best yakitori in NYC). Taisho also holds a special place in my heart.
Edna C.}Astoria, Queens, NY}129}372}137}-1}1}6/20/2011}OH HELL TO THE NO!I was starving by the time I walked in here, but I was aware it was sort of a Japanese tapas type of restaurant. When I got the menu...I must have scanned it for 20minutes, I could not find anything that sounded appealing to me. Perhaps this was the wrong restaurant for me to venture in as I do not eat sashimi. But at least have some interesting cooked dishes....is that so much to ask? Anyway, I ended up with the fried potato balls, which were a complete miss. I felt like I could have gotten this at a chinese bakery and have it taste better. It was too much dough, not enough mashed potatoes inside. Also had the fried pork strips--DISGUSTING! It was oozing in this sort of sweet grease and had a weird texture and taste to it. If they were trying to be unique, they failed. We also ordered their grilled steak cubes, which was pretty much overcooked steak drowned in ginger sesame dressing. RIPOFF!
Nikola L.}Delray Beach, FL}22}65}0}-1}5}6/14/2011}This place is so amazing, it doesn't even need my review (based on the fact that it has over 400 already). Very authentic and incredible sake selection.  We had a couple of sake flights, both of which were wonderful.  I don't even know of anywhere else that offers sake flights!!
Siv L.}San Francisco, CA}189}821}44}18}4}6/12/2011Updatedreview}Came here for the second time, with a large party. We ordered a few bottles of sake. I'm not a huge fan or drinker of sake so I thought it was OK (apparently it was kind of expensive, at $75/bottle). I tried sea urchin for the first time, which was OK. We had the gyu miso nikomi (shredded beef in a stew), the nihachi soba (cold noodles served in soy dipping sauce), the agedashi tofu, saikoro steak, beef tongue with radish, taro potato, spinach and shiitake mushrooms, and the tori karaage (deep fried chicken in sake and ginger infused soy sauce). Everything was pretty good, liked the cold noodles, steak, and fried chicken the most.Would definitely come back because I love the ambience and the menu is pretty extensive so there's always plenty to try.
Jenny L.}Queens, NY}96}191}288}-1}4}6/11/2011}ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup.He was right, the way how we both enjoy Uni, we had to each order one of these. Great service, good food, serves sake in interesting looking containers and beautiful presentation.Get the pork belly too :-)
Larry K.}Annapolis, MD}0}20}0}-1}5}6/7/2011}After reading other reviews, followed the small sign to the office building basement where they are located.  Well worth the hunt - best sashimi I have ever tasted (and I have gone out for sushi in almost every major town on the East and West coasts).  Beautiful, large chunks of fresh fish.  Service fast and unobtrusive.  And, if you like sake, they have a whole menu for that (I chose their most popular and it was excellent). Not cheap ($55 for the 15-piece sashimi), but I will definitely be back.  Yum!
Jonathan J.}New York, NY}557}162}4}-1}4}6/5/2011}WUT the WUT!? Is this place for real? Does it truly exist? Was it a figment of my imagination? Could it be the best sake bar in NYC? I'm thinking that answer is a "hells yea".. can I get an Amen!?I always wanted to go to Sakagura, I had heard it was the most authentic Japanese dining experience in the city... and for the first time in a while, the rumors were true. This spot is legit. From the makeshift Japanese village decor, to the 100s of bottles of sake lining the bar wall, and even to the basement location, this place reminds me of all those incredible random restaurants in Asia I've left behind.After dining on sushi across the street at Sushi Yasuda, my colleague and I figured the best way to end the night would be over a couple of bottles of sake at Sakagura. After placing our butts on the seats at the bar, we dove right in and went with some dry sake prepared in traditional Masu boxes. The sake was superb! Smooth, layered with flavors and with a hint of ginger on the nose. After a few more sips, we realized that side dishes were needed. We jumped into the deep end and ordered a traditional octopus in squid liver dish and the pork belly soup. The squid liver was an acquired taste, it was a very foie gras heavy flavor that lingered long after you finished eating it. Surprising, but delicious nonetheless. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the accompanying broth was light and flavorful. The whole ensemble packed a punch and was visually appealing. Overall, this spot offers the best of the best in terms of traditional Japanese sake bars with a twist. The ambiance, the patrons, and the food are great. Good luck finding this spot, as it is hidden from the casual eye...but so worth it when you do!
Paul J.}Keller, TX}88}16}1}-1}5}6/4/2011}Best, most authentic Japanese I've had in NYC. Or anywhere else. Period.Nothing more to say about this gem, except that finding it is a bit of a "Where's Waldo" exercise that only adds to the mystique.Great find. Oh, and trust me: get the chocolate souffle. (Yes, they have one and it is to die for).
Jeff W.}Valley Stream, NY}0}15}1}-1}5}6/4/2011}One of the few trendy places of any kind in New York that lives up to its billing.  It's impossible to overrate this place.I've been going here for years, pretty much since it first opened.  In that time, it has gone from kind of a sleepy hole in the wall to an always crowded trendy sake bar and restaurant.  But the food and service has never changed.  All that's really changed is that now you'd better have a reservation if you want a table.I visit Japan at least once a year (and not just Tokyo) and this place is really authentically Japanese, both the food and decor.  They have probably the biggest sake selection in the city, and portions are tapas style, which is common in Japan.  You're meant to order a bunch of stuff and share it over your choice of alcohol.  (They do have actual entrees too, but this seems more of a nod to their western audience.)I've never had anything bad at Sakagura, but what really keeps me coming back is their black sesame creme brulee, which is, as far as I know, unique to them in New York City.  Black sesame is kind of an acquired taste, but this dessert is what led me to acquire it.  Not only do you get a black sesame creme brulee with this dessert, but also a scoop of handmade black sesame ice cream and a black sesame cookie.  It is black sesame overload, but it's delicious.  My favorite dessert anywhere.
Jade K.}San Francisco, CA}52}56}40}-1}5}6/2/2011}I'm in New York wanting to try something new, something ethnic. So when Japanese gets thrown into the mix, I feel a little - eh, I've tried that before, maybe something else? But boy was I glad to have gotten the chance to try Sakagura. I am a big fan of Japanese food - whether it is sushi, ramen, izakaya .. you name it. I went to Sakagura for lunch (they have a special lunch set that is definitely worth trying!) and their service was really great. They have imported sake from Japan and a really nice interior that brought me back to Japan. (Their bathroom is so amazing! A must see! haha) Having soba with sobayu automatically racked up points for authenticity! & their sesame ice cream with sweet soy sauce. Yes, soy sauce was really great to try.
Alex E.}Manhattan, NY}730}94}18}-1}5}5/28/2011}One of my all time favorite restaurants. I took the woman here for Valentines day.Everything we had was amazing and unique.The duck special that they had was the best duck I ever tried. It was absolutely perfect, it had a layer of fat on the top, not too much, but enough for it to melt in your mouth and taste like heaven.The fried mashed potato balls with salt were great. I dont like heavy starchy foods, but this was light and really good.Their fried chicken was very moist and delicious.The three different eggplants were the best eggplant I ever had in my life. I did not know which sauce was better, each one I tasted I said was "my favorite".The beef on the hot plate was good but I would not order it again, not too much of it although what I loved is that they used a cub of fat as "butter" for the rock. That was good.Service was good, and I liked that it was low key, the decor is really cool as well.
Crsie K.}New York, NY}111}51}16}-1}5}5/27/2011}The BEST and most authentic Japanese restaurant in NYC. I would never claim a restaurant as the best unless the restaurant lives up to the title.I absolutely love this place. Been to this restaurant a handful of times and I have never been disappointed by any of their dishes. You can probably blindly pick the items and the food will still be amazing.  Reason: the food is just THAT good.Atmosphere - very charming spot found in the basement. First time that I went, thought I might have entered into some underground casino but it was really a secret hiding spot with delicious food.Food - the pork belly seriously melts on your tongue. The idea of eating an entire piece of fat may not be appealing but it's worth the extra calories. Their soup base is sweet but not overwhelming. It leaves you wanting for more. Everything on the menu is excellent. I try to order different items every time and it's been great. Service - waiters were very attentive. it's an absolutely must try if you're in nyc. the japanese food won't get better than this.
Echo W.}Hopewell Junction, NY}27}311}106}-1}5}5/26/2011}This is a wonderful gem in midtown. I had the lunch special of chirashi set with soba. It was delightful. As the daily offering is limited, get there early if you would like to take advantage of the specials. Also, the restaurant gets filled quickly so do plan to go early.
Rich K.}Astoria, NY}62}108}1}-1}4}5/24/2011}Been here a few times, once recently for dinner.Definitely a hidden gem of a spot.  Everything was excellent from start to finish.  All the dishes were yummy!  Some of memory were the fluke carpaccio, chawan mushi, kakuni, chicken, beef on hot stone, etc.  Reminds me of a hybrid between EN Japanese Brasserie (good food, creative dishes, good sake) and YokoCho/Hagi (tapas style, inexpensive)They'll take a free picture of you and your date on your bday.  Oh and their chocolate souffle was... amazing!  Too bad she returned from the bathroom and dessert was 80% gone!~   (:
J K.}Doylestown, PA}104}114}0}-1}5}5/22/2011}i love this place!  Ordered a bunch of dishes and everything was so yummy!  Sashimi dish was so fresh and nicely marinated.  Can't wait to go back and try more!
Percy N.}Collegeville, PA}83}340}631}18}4}5/22/2011}- Find entrance to restaurant hiding behind non-descript office building - check.- Get there in time to order one of 20 soba noodle specials - check- Warm hand towels - check- Slurp and enjoy delicious Japanese cuisine - priceless.Recommend the Chirashi don Soba.
hyo l.}Manhattan, NY}0}29}6}-1}4}5/21/2011}i love the atmosphere of the restaurant. not too loud like oh taisho or kenka. you can actually have a conversation here. their dishes were very clean and neat. i thought eggplant dish was very tasty.
John N.}Los Angeles, CA}445}1044}159}-1}2}5/16/2011}My cousin was coming over to hang out with me so he let me decided on a place and me and him both bookmark this place to try so 1 less to worry about. We took the cab and they drop us right in front of this place. At first I didn't know where to go but I remember reading on yelp that it is in the basement. Some girl waiting for her ride saw us looking for the restaurant so she say yes just go downstaire.I like the way it was design and the place look and feel awesome. There were a whole book just for different types of sake and some of them ran to hundred and thousands. I pick the Saturday special sake which was a good deal for $13 for a small bottle. We all decided to pick 2 dishes each so I pick the eel vinaigrette and the sea urchin with a eggs. Both of them were very disappointed and not even worth it. I also pick the Spicy cod fish roe but it was all salt and believe me, I can eat a lot of salt but this dish I barely could touch it. I order the uni soba which I was excited about but later on they told me that they ran out of this. So I order a few more dishes but nothing was really tasty. The highlight of the night was ordering the black seed cream brulee which was soo dam tasty. I could have eaten another one all by myself. Overall this experience suck, don't get me wrong I like the sake and the evironment but the food just suck. Next time I will just drink.
Jasz J.}Hollywood, CA}206}198}155}-1}2}5/15/2011}It was a long day and night for me as this was the spot chosen for dinner. Taxi ride from Queens we came, and this location being downstairs was mmm. I like it. Walking in here, I thought wow; I like them Sake bar! It was a cool joint for hang out and it was not overly loud and would be a good place to have a conversation.  Being that I already had dinner at a previous restaurant, I didn't care to order much. So the others order with what they know I would enjoy, UNI something. Here what we ordered.ONSEN TAMAGO :  Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup  $9.It was delicate. With maybe 2 pcs of uni, I was searching for more. The roe to me overpower the flavor of this dish.HIYAYAKKO :  Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes  $5.00I have to say this was the 2nd best dish, and tasted a complete dish. All the component work together, as I love bonito flakes.MENTAIKO :  Spicy Cod Fish Roe Imported from Japan  $7.00SALTY! That's really all I taste. Salt, salt, and more salt..UZAKU :  Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed  $8.5Why do they put cucumber slices for? This takes away the flavor of the eel and bland the plate up.. I think this plate was totally wrongly done. Design and sign, I would like the grilled eel to shine, my expectation.HIRAME PONZU :  Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette   $9.00This is not so fresh fluke here, and the grated dikon radish tasted fresher here. I am disappointed with the sashimi plate. Don't order this!Food tasted below average for me, but I have to say their dessert was something to talk here. The flavor was good and being that I love black sesame, the dessert works for me. So maybe this is just a hangout for sake and dessert? BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream                                        $9.002 bottle of sake and Sapporo was added to our ordered.  All and all, I would come here to hang out for sake and dessert.
Anna A.}Manhattan, NY}111}48}24}-1}4}5/14/2011}I went here with some friends.. The menu is very different, there are no sushi or rolls and not such a great selection of sashimi either. I didn't recognize more than half of the menu, so I asked the waiter which are the most popular dishes and got them. The food was good, you just have to be careful with what you order to be on you taste.The service is ok.
W Z.}New York, NY}25}34}44}-1}5}5/10/2011}Be prepared to be caught off-guard at the location of this restaurant (basement of a gray midtown office building). Once you walk through the maze of stairs, you will be delighted to see this hidden spot with lovely decor!Heads up (if you are not aware yet), this is not a japanese sushi/sashemi bar, it's more of a Japanese tapas bar. Everything was delicious and top notch on the menu and I will definitely recommend the Pear Millefeuille with Earl Gray Ice Cream.Will definitely go back!
T L.}New York, NY}1}7}0}-1}3}5/7/2011}I used to love the sake tastings here with limited seating and paired with food, before the tastings became so popular.  I had not returned in a long time, but was looking for something simple.My father and uncle were visiting from Tokyo and Taipei and were offended that we were made to wait outside for 15 min (with a reservation), only to discover that the restaurant was half empty.  Nobody left the restaurant while we were waiting, so one can not explain the wait on a shortage of waiters.  They told us they were "waiting to clear the tables."My experience with this place is they are rude and rush non-Japanese speakers.  We purposely spoke Japanese and got good service after we were seated even though our Japanese waiter wasn't very good at Japanese.The food is ok, not great.  Americans probably like being treated poorly so they think the restaurant is a special place ("come on time, we can only hold your table for 15 minutes").  It's the same concept as queuing outside a discotheque.By being rude and rushing out Americans, I know you'd like to have mostly Japanese patrons.  But any MORON from Japan would know you can't lie to us and treat us poorly to make the restaurant look good.  My uncle didn't even notice the food.  He was still remarking on our treatment prior to being seated.  When we left the restaurant, we saw another Japanese couple waiting outside for no reason.We were offended and will not return.
Bo C.}Manhattan, NY}11}6}0}-1}5}5/5/2011}I first went here with my ex. She's a huge sashimi fan - so it was either here or Yusada. My friend finally convinced me of this place saying it was nice quiet, intimate and spacious place. If you're trying to get to know someone, or want a quiet night with someone special without having people eavesdrop on your conversation.  This would definitely be the place to go. Taking the elevator down an office building basement felt like I was being transported to Tokyo. I've been here twice since the first time in 09 and its yet to disappoint me. Everything I had here has been delicious. Not the best place for sashmi selection but everything they had was super fresh!The Chocolate souffle was the best in NYC I ever had. Actually might be the best I ever had period. Their seasonal Mango souffle is super dupaaaaa fly but only available late summer/early fall.GET THE JIDOR SHIOYAKII!!! Best everrrrrrrr besides that I'd recommend the Ebi Stick and SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU! Actually, I haven't had anything disappointing here exceptttt the Udon and Soba! It makes sense its a izakaya ("beer" food) place and not a noodle shop. So avoid them! Sake is selection is the best in town but a  bit overpriced but what do you expect? You're in a Mid-town restaurant and not drinkin rice wine in Chi-townAnyway, great spacious place to hang out for a quiet date, or pregame dinner with your buddies. I'd recommend going to Yasuda first if you had a craving for sushi, and strictly desert at Sakagura.
Michael L.}San Mateo, CA}169}168}6}-1}5}5/3/2011}What can be said that hasn't been said already about this place??? =)My wife and I strolled through 1/4 of Manhattan to find this place.  The directions are not clear, and it is in the bottom of a very generic office building.   (of course we saw this on No Reservations w/A.Bourdain).We walked down a nondescript stairway, and was introduced to a very ornate floor and entrance for Sakagura.   Lots of pretty wood, and decorations.   We were greeted to a very spoiled, entitled chinese girl (who lacked perspective) complaining to the hostess, that it was the HOSTESS' responsibility to tell this girl, when her friend arrives at the restaurant so keep their reservation.REALLY?  You want the hostess to comb through the 30 plus people sitting down and ask "Are you Christy Chan's friend?  I serve her every need, eventhough she doesn't work here".    I literally LAUGHED at the entitled girl, because of her inane request.Anyhow, happily, we were seated BEFORE the spoiled girl and smiled all the way to our table(and w/out a reservation).IF people don't know, Sakagura get's all of their sushi daily from the Tsukigi fish market in Japan.   We ordered their sashimi sampler and it was AWESOME.   Super fresh hamachi, toro, and shiro maguro.   It's similar to the difference between fresh made to order tortillas and tortillas that have been sitting around.   The fish just melts in your mouth like butter.When my wife and I experience really good food, it's more of an emotive experience for us.   Really good food tells a story, and you can really understand the nuances of the culture and the food when it's high quality.   The freshest fish like this, gives you a perspective of how necessary it is to eat food from the source and avoid processed food.We ordered shrimp infused rice to eat alongside the sashimi.Very subtle but distinct flavor, that just takes you to another place.THE DESSERTS at Sakagura were outrageous.We ordered a sesame seed creme brulee, that knocked our socks off.Normally creme brulee is very sugary, and quite overpowering in sweetness for my tastes, because of the camerlized crust.The crust from this creme brulee was moderately sweet, subtle, and totally complemented the custard.   Again, strong, w/out pounding your chest.   We loved it, and hated why there was nothing like this in California.We also had a coffee infused ice cream that has the essence of cafe, in every concentrated bite.   Sakagura is a total flavor journey.   If you can cleanse your palate, of the sugary, shiney, coming around the mountain theme rolls that you think is sushi, you will experience REAL JAPANESE FOOD, that touches your soul.Just try and keep track of your friends in the waiting line, and not blame the hostess for your iniquities =)
aaron t.}Boston, MA}31}148}32}-1}4}5/1/2011}Fun space, tasty food, price is pretty fair as well. Come her with a small group, or large group (10ish).
Just S.}Albany, NY}0}13}9}-1}5}5/1/2011}Simply fantastic! A HUGE variety of Sake. Also a delicious dish i must mention was where you are responsible for cooking your own little cuts of beef on a hot stone you are given at your table.
Magpie M.}New York, NY}93}51}2}-1}5}4/30/2011}Amazing amazing food.Went here with my mother in law last night (she is Japanese) and I think it was the happiest I have ever seen her :)We got (3 of us shared) (all wonderfully delectable):--Gomaee (spinach in a tahini dressing - dressing was so creamy and good - I need to figure out how to make it like this)--Gomuku Kinpira (lotus root, burdock, some other stuff, little bit of beef - tiny portion, but also really good - couldn't really taste or see the beef)--Tofu salad (just lettuce and tomatoes with a block of soft tofu, topped with some sort of Tsukemono - very simple and very yum)--Seaweed salad (a bunch of seaweeds over a some lettuce - best dressing ever - dressings come on the side and you pour them on btw)Then:--Saikoro steak (small pieces of steak in a minced oniony sauce... tender and flavorful)--Tori karaage (fried chicken - best karaage any of us had ever had - and we all eat Japanese food a lot!)With:--2 orders of the Homemade Nihachi soba (best soba we've ever had too!) (these were for my husband and his mom)--Miso yakionigiri (grilled rice balls brushed with miso - OMG - crispy exterior, perfectly cooked rice, really delicious - the server recommended it) (this was mine)Dessert:--green tea ice gream - perfection! came with a cute little sweet cracker thing.To drink:--1 sake (I don't remember which one... it was recommended by the server when we said "cheap and sweet" - $10 whatever it was)--1 sapporo!Highly recommended - enjoy!
Rasha A.}New York, NY}0}56}0}-1}1}4/28/2011}This has got to be one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. I don't understand all the good reviews on Yelp. I like to think of myself as someone who appreciates good food, regardless of the price but the food here is not that great whatsoever. You can find this type of Japanese food at several locations in the city. The problem is that the portions and the prices are ridiculous. You will get two small cups of rice with a bit of crab meat for $26. You will get a pinch of tuna sashimi for $10. You will get a bit of Sea Urchin for $22. The food will not wow you. You will leave hungrier than when you entered. I ordered 4 plates because I was told the portions were small but I had no idea they were tiny! In the end, I paid over $50 for eating food that could probably all fit in one small regular sized plate. I left the place hungry. It simply is not worth your time or money. It isn't like some explosion of flavors in your mouth that warrants the extra money. There is nothing justifying the portions and the price. I would rather go to more highly acclaimed restaurants that offer better food and better portions at pretty much the same price. I haven't mentioned the fact that this place is in the basement of a building, the service is lousy, and the menu lacks any and all organization. Do yourself a favor: Skip this place.
han Z.}Manhattan, NY}1}8}0}-1}5}4/28/2011}One of my favarite Japanese restaurant in town. The sake tasting special is beautiful.
Vanessa H.}Bakersfield, CA}296}987}78}-1}4}4/25/2011}I felt very lucky to get seated here last Friday night. I knew after reading the reviews that if I hadn't called a week in advance to book a table for 2, there was no way we were getting one. Thankfully we scored at least some seating by 1. sitting at the bar, and 2. arriving close to 7:00.The food was fantastic. I had no less than three dishes, all of which were very good or great. I'm not a fish-eater, so I'm sure that I missed out on the restaurant's main offerings. But if you prefer food with feet, here's my take: - The Gyu Mios Nikomi (shredded beef back ribs in a miso broth). Tender and flavorful meat, with broth you can drink afterwards! - Some filet medallion dish that is served with a hot rock and ponzu sauce. It was a special, so I can't find it on the regular menu, but $20 for the small plate is seems like a lot until you taste the meat. It's incredibly high quality.  - Some noodle soup with minced chicken on top. It's not on their online menu but it was pretty good. I would probably stick to the beef plates though.Good service and we enjoyed a nice leisurely dinner. Sitting at the bar doesn't make for really easy conversation (I felt like I had to keep my body tilted at this weird angle) but it's worth it to be able to eat here.
Albert C.}Elk Grove, CA}10}50}0}-1}4}4/22/2011}Portions are very small, but I guess that's somewhat to be expected at a sake house.  I would definitely recommend this place to relax and have some sake, while trying out many different dishes.  Most of the dishes were very unique and flavorful.  I guess my only complaints were the portions and the price.
peter b.}Cambridge, MA}5}9}0}-1}3}4/21/2011}OK, here are my thoughts.  Terrible entrance, humid basementy squalor.  If you can power through, yer in for a treat.  Fluke sashimi, awesome.  Edamame, great, though the produce looks a little aged.  The sake den with red guard is cool.  Sesame creme brulee???  Amazing!
Nancy L.}Bridgewater, NJ}114}309}309}-1}5}4/19/2011Updatedreview}Came here again this past Saturday, a group of 12, and called weeks in advance for reservation. They basically combine several tables to form a large rectangular table to fit all of us, and was pretty decent, we didn't feel crushed/crowded at all~We ordered our usual favorites: chilled homemade tofu, sashimi platter (yellowtail, snapper, uni, toro, and macro), fluke carpaccio,  surumeika yaki (grilled squid), black miso cod, beef tongue, and wagyu beef.We also tried two new dishes this time: Maguro Tartar (tuna sashimi with roe) and uni soba (a special our waiter recommended); both were delish! As for sake, we had our usual and for dessert, we cannot persuade ourselves to order anything else but the black sesame creme burlee! Yum yum yum...everything was so good and I mean EVERYTHING. Also, not an expensive restaurant to dine, so I don't know what you're waiting for! But hold on, I take that back, maybe you should wait longer to try this place cuz I'm already having trouble booking reservations! jk, jk ;) ENJOY!
Lindsey C.}New York, NY}7}64}2}-1}2}4/18/2011}This place has excellent service, but the location and food quality to price ratio drove my 2 star rating.  The location is a moderate detractor but the real kicker is the moderate price to less than average food quality/quantity.$45 will get a lunch for two that includes 4 shrimp tempura (total) 2 bowls of rice and 2 bowls of soba noodles.  The tempura and noodle broth were very middle of the road and the rice and soba noodles were rice and soba noodles so nothing mind blowing there.  There was nothing bad about my visit, I just think there are much better lunch options around and don't think I'd ever go back.
Kailyn G.}San Francisco, CA}48}311}49}-1}4}4/17/2011}Well, I've never been out for Japanese tapas before - so I have very little comparison. But my problem with tapas is that I hate making choices. This results in my eating companion making the choices and it's hard to remember everything I ate. My friend and I sat at the bar, which on some level I like more than at a table (it's easier to talk to someone right next to you).Let me try to remember all that we ordered: a beef dish that cooked on a hot rock (very cool), egg custard (loved it!), a rice dish with those red balls (not memorable), a vegetable dish suggested by our waitress (very good). Overall, it was a good experience.Environment: It felt like any normal Japanese restaurant. I like that they have a waiting area apart from the eating area. Perfect lighting. Would be impossible for me to find on my own.Service: Decent. Our waitress was nice about us ordering sporadically. Food came out at a decent pace.
El R.}Palo Alto, CA}2}22}0}-1}4}4/15/2011}This place is good.  They have a vast selection of special Japanese dishes, and they're almost all prepared very well.  I was a little disappointed with the rice balls I ordered, because I'm used to getting them grilled and crispy on the outside, but Sakagura's are just simple balls of white rice, which seems kind of pointless.  Overall, this is a decent place if you're looking for a Japanese restaurant with lots of grilled, braised, fried, etc. dishes as opposed to the many sushi places in the area.  However, I do think Aburiya Kinnosuke nearby is superior.
Fiona Y.}Manhattan, NY}51}31}0}-1}5}4/14/2011}I think this is my favorite restaurant in NYC!   I've been here a few times, and it has been a wonderful experience every, single time!  This is a Japanese tapa-style restaurant!  He he... I like this because I'm just greedy and like to taste everything!  I haven't tried a lot of their dishes on the menu yet, but I just love, love, love the Kamo Roast (roasted duck with scallion and some amazing special basil sauce), Maguro Tartar (tuna tartar with  caviar), and Sake Oyako Don (salmon sashimi and roe over rice)  Words cannot describe how heavenly and unique the salmon and roe tasted!
Stan P.}Manhattan, NY}1}181}0}-1}4}4/14/2011}One of my favorite Japanese in the city.  Wait is annoying.  Love the desserts, esp. the black sesame creme brulee and the green tea truffles.  The other hot foods are also generally quite good, with a few exceptions.    Have not tried the sake here even though this is technically a sake-ya.
Lu H.}Queens, NY}1209}407}1855}-1}4}4/12/2011}This place is really wonderful.  I've been here twice, most recently took my mom here and she loved it. Highlights were the tuna tartare, the eel, and the duck wrapped scallion (which I ordered based off other Yelp reviews -- was not let down).  I would get these again without hesitation.  The beef tongue was also very good but a tad salty.  Grilled squid was nice, but not as good compared to other dishes.   Dishes I would skip are the soy marinated cod, eggplant, and chicken meatballs.  For the cod and meatballs, I feel like there are places that do them better.  The cod was also oddly salty and not a dish that is really very unique.  You can get it elsewhere, so I would skip it unless you are really craving cod.  Chicken meatballs were somewhat dry and not memorable.  I'm a big fan of  sesame based desserts, so I was excited to try their sesame creme brulee with sesame ice cream.  The creme brulee part was good, but I was a little disappointed that the ice cream tasted just like vanilla ice cream, because it only had streaks of black sesame.  I did, however, enjoy the earl grey and green tea ice creams on my second visit.  Nice light way to end the meal.  I enjoyed this experience better than Aburiya Kinnosuke for some reason.  I can't put my finger on it, maybe I ordered the wrong things at Aburiya.  I will be coming back to Sakagura.  Its proximity to Grand Central is a nice plus too, and I like that you can sample different things here, have a light dinner, and walk away full but not stuffed.
Melissa H.}Manhattan, NY}6}13}1}-1}3}4/11/2011}I'll start with dessert first. I read reviews before I came here, and so it was a very very good choice to go with the black sesame creme brulee. So, so delicious and unique, had the right consistency, and wasn't too sweet. I would definitely recommend it! The pear ice cream was ok, I enjoyed it, but would recommend the black sesame creme brulee :)As for the entree, we ordered the soft crab with rice that comes in a clay pot (for two people) and I have to say that it was quite disappointing. I was actually really looking forward to it, especially since the waitress said it has become a more and more popular choice among customers. The crab was soft and tender, but there was too much rice that was mixed into it which made my experience here only 3 stars
Christine K.}Manhattan, NY}61}58}5}-1}5}4/8/2011}I have never seen such a wide selection of sake. The bathroom are unique. Got about 8 different plates of stuff I would never usually try, everything was pleasant although while reading the descriptions on the menu I was pretty put off. Don't get scared! Friendly staff who are also very helpful and knowledgeable. If you like big portions, this is not the place for you as everything is served on small plates and usually meant to be shared.
Anna M.}New York, NY}31}25}5}-1}5}3/29/2011}I lived in Japan.  My college major was Japanese.   I have lived in New York for 24 years and have yet to find a better Japanese restaurant.  I've been here with family, friends and dates and each time it fits the mood.  Every time I dine here, it is a surprisingly unique experience.  Not only do I try a different sake every time (because I can - the overwhelming  menu almost demands it) but the food menu is just as tantalizing.  While sticking to the popular staples such as the tuna tartar and the jyaga dango (sticky potato mash dipped in sweet doughnut batter and fried, with salt as the only necessary condiment) the specials menu always offers something that must be ordered, whether it is jumbo oysters with shiso, lemon and panko or wagyu-grade beef that you cook yourself on a hotstone at the table.  One could order round after round of food here until you come to the hazy realization that for the past three hours you have been in sake and food lovers heaven.  And then you get dessert (Earl Grey ice cream, anyone?)
Liz C.}Brooklyn, NY}643}600}3}-1}4}3/24/2011}If you're ever on the fence about the East 43rd Street Japanese joints, Sakagura is going to be a good-to-great bet for dinner - IF you have the luxury of eating a little for a lot. Its "secret" location isn't exactly low-profile; I'd venture to say it's even a little weird - clearly marked, but situated in a windowless corporate basement. That's fine, though, because the dining experience at large is good - beginning from the lovely, expansive dining room and its tasteful  Japanese accents, and ending with (what else?) its excellent dessert selection.I've tried about ten of the regular menu items, and can confidently assure you that the food is solid, if only a little pricey ($6 - $20) for the minuscule portions.
Geert D.}New York, NY}227}120}11}-1}3}3/23/2011}Nah, nothing to deserve the 4.5 *'s on this one. Nice and cosy, friendly staff and decent dishes. But exceptional: certainly not.
Jacob Y.}New York, NY}184}467}120}-1}5}3/21/2011}If sake is your game, this place is so for you.  And me.  And one of the best selections and varieties to choose from.  And I can honestly say I had my fix for months to come.  But that is not all.I was invited last minute by a friend to try out this place after happy hour this past week.  When we ventured over from happy hour to this restaurant, my first impression of walking into an office building intimidated me a bit, considering I just got out of work.   But do not fear.  When you walk down the stairs to the basement where this restaurant is located, it almost feel like you are being transported to a different dimension of Japanese culture.The decor is quite impressive I must say.  And to see that most patrons are Japanese, that made it very encouraging.Onto the food.  We ordered an array of dishes.  Considering there were four of us, we had a great sampling of oysters, steak slices, edamame (I know, how cliche!), along with all the fixings.  Yes, you know where I am going with this.  What REALLY stood out were the oysters.  Massive, succulent and perfectly cooked.  And unlike Morimoto's, these were not overly saucy, and they were EXQUISITE!And top my meal with their version of creme brulee, I was in HEAVEN!  Oh I so need to come back to get my fixing once in a while.  And I highly recommend you come with a good group of friends!
Ken W.}New York, NY}67}227}106}-1}4}3/17/2011}Definitely one of my favorite restaurants, although i end up ordering the same thing over and over again. Salmon and Ikura don, the grilled miso eggplant done three ways, and the chicken karaage. The sake selection here, of course, is superlative and often good value. The chocolate mousse dessert is always a good choice. Lunch specials are also good, but you really have to work close by to take advantage of them. The service is very friendly and efficient.
B Y.}New York, NY}30}130}0}-1}5}3/10/2011}The hallmark of a 5-star Yelp restaurant, I think, often lies in the fact that everything about the restaurant is consistently great. It's so easy sometimes to rest on good word-of-mouth, and I have unfortunately seen many restaurants fall off in quality over the years. But not so with Sakagura. The service is impeccably polite. The food is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. The decor transports you from the basement of a midtown building all the way to Japan.There are almost too many things to order off the menu. Thinly sliced duck garnished with scallions, a refreshing salad of shaved radish and roe mayonnaise, and a fun interpretation of tuna tartar topped with two types of roe are among my favorite dishes. It is so much fun to order a wealth of little dishes to share, and for the drinkers, there's a myriad of sake choices to mix and match as well. I don't come here often, maybe once or twice a year. But every time I go, I leave full and contentedly happy.
Elizabeth S.}Brooklyn, NY}1}19}0}-1}5}3/10/2011}This is another one of those places that just does everything right. The atmosphere, the service, the food...it just all makes sense and leaves you so satisfied.Standouts - The duck. I don't know why I love this every time, but putting a piece of cold duck in my mouth that has been roasted to perfection, with a hint of salt and herbs - it's amazing.The sashimi platter. Holy crap, I've never tasted fresher fish in my life. The selection is always right on, from melt in your mouth, buttery fatty tuna, to briney uni and things you've (I've) never had before, like snapper sashimi.The black sesame creme brulee, as mentioned before, is out of control. It'st he perfect vehicle for such a unique flavor - that nutty comforting flavor whipped up in a pot of luscious cream. Yum.
Ning D.}New York, NY}84}17}53}-1}5}3/9/2011}I have to say this is the best Japanese Tapas place I hav even been.If you are tired of Sushi, Ramen and seaweed salad, Sakagura is the BEST place to have something amazingly delicious and surprising.SETTING:very Japanese style; you have to try their BATHROOM~ haha ~ you will agree!DISHES:The duck shred and cod fish are my all time favorite~~~~The tofu salad is very refreshing~Beef tongue is pretty good is you are a fan of stuff like that ~For desert: black sesame pudding!! no doubt please ~All in all ~ this is a place that will never let you down ~
Rebecca K.}New York, NY}22}170}0}-1}4}3/5/2011}This place is awesome!! My coworker and I stumbled upon this place for lunch the other day and we had such a great meal. Only minor complaint was the service was a bit slow, but I guess what can you expect on a busy Friday. I was somewhat rushed to get back to work after our 1.5-hour lunch though.....Definitely deserves at least 4 stars though.This place has awesome lunch options and just delicious amazing food overall. I went with the combo of salmon sashimi and roe served over rice with cold soba noodles on the side. The soba are served with dipping sauce that is very delish, along with some pickled vegetable that was tastey... but I'm not quite sure what it was. I will definitely be back for their sashimi, it is very delicious. My coworker had the hot duck served in a hot soba noodles soup. She also loved it and we vowed to come back here.The ambiance is also really cool. It's underground in a random building, but when you walk into the restaurant it sort of has a cave feeling. It feels like what I thought a traditional Japanese restaurant should. I really wished I'd taken a picture of the place and the food. Great experience.
Scott L.}New York, NY}5000}2188}3600}18}5}3/4/2011}Eating out in New York for out of towners can be a big gamble even with some guidance and research.  My decision to eat at Sakagura was a big score:  it had a special ambiance without being fussy and my lunch was excellent, and seemingly authentic Japanese at an affordable price.  I had a two flight sake taster for $10.  It was lunch, but I was on vacation. Then I ordered the jewel bento box for $20, a treasure chest of snacks, which included a rich miso soup, sashimi, rice balls, fried goodness and more.   I ate my brains out and had to turn down the dessert. A good reason to come back.  This is a little trick I have up my sleeve now to surprise a dear friend with my saviness of New York!'* decent walk from grand central station* make reservations* highly recommended by me
Toshi B.}Manhattan, NY}7}78}3}-1}4}2/26/2011}Great great basement hideaway with good food....worth a visit at least once....
Mike Y.}Cary, NC}51}197}3}-1}5}2/23/2011}This is the quintessential midtown Sushi joint to me. It's hidden in the basement of a larger building with no real signage indicating the gem that is located two grungy stair cases below. Once in the restaurant it's a dark and stylish homage to Japanese simplicity. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar and my server made some great recommendations for me. I started with a bowl of the miso soup which had a very dark hue and had rich deep flavors that stayed with you. After that I had the sashimi dinner which featured 3 sashimi pieces of 5 different fish. Normally tuna is my fave but here it was the least greatest of the 5. The sea urchin was excellent. I also had the amadai saikyo yaki which was grilled fillets of tile fish. It blew my mind. If there were only one baby tile fish left on the planet I would hunt it down and catch it with no regrets and then bring it to Sakagura myself so they could make this for me and I could have it one last time. Overall an excellent dining experience.
Ken L.}Alpharetta, GA}26}33}101}-1}5}2/19/2011}I went here one night 2 and a half years ago, but I think some of the best food pics I've ever taken were taken on that night.  The presentation of the food here is beautiful and you can tell that the people that make your dishes really put a lot of thought and care into delivering not only great food, but a fun experience for you.  I sat at the bar and while I was eating, I could see how the desserts were being made and how detail-oriented they were at every step of the process!The food was amazing.  The seared toro was the best I've ever had, the chawanmushi was delicious...The chicken nuggets had a garnish of lemon that was in the shape of a gazelle (something with two horns...)!  I ended up spending a lot of money that night, but it was money well spent for a great experience and great pictures!!!Very highly recommended.   In the basement of an office building near grand central station... make reservations and don't be late!
Roberto B.}Los Angeles, CA}125}78}0}-1}5}2/18/2011}Sakagura is straight out of a novel by Murakami. I am referring to Ryu Murakami- the Murakami that nobody reads. The "Coin Locker Babies" Murakami.It is in the basement of an office building. You go down a flight of stairs, and through a discreet door is a whole different universe. Japan has never felt so close to Manhattan. The place is beautiful. It's dark, atmospheric, elegant, stylish. The staff is Japanese and young-ish. The clientele is almost consistently Japanese- I watched four Japanese businessmen drink their way through several bottles of sake, and pass out onto each other.The food is great as well. I had the fried chicken, stewed diced pork (amazing), chicken meatballs and tuna tartar. I have heard complaints regarding the service. I sat at the bar, which I think helps considerably. I ended up bonding with my sake sensei- a lovely waitress who helped me navigate through the extensive menus- and had no problem getting her attention. On a busy night, I can see the service being slow. It's a surprisingly big place and the back room is very secluded. So if you are back there, and there are not that many people around you, you run the risk of being forgotten.I am also not sure about their reservation policy. I walked in with a friend and was seated at the bar within a few minutes. It does feel like reservations should be made in advance, however. The secrecy of this place is not a gimmick. At least, I don't see it that way. It's simply a nice way of setting the tone for the establishment: if you come here, you know about it because a) you are Japanese, b) you were referred to it by someone who has been, or c) you are a foodie.I can't imagine people stumbling into Sakagura with no prior knowledge of its location. The sign outside the building does little in the way of directing you to the main entrance, and I think the owners wanted it that way.Overall a wonderful, unique experience. Kampai!
Dave J.}Brooklyn, NY}4}21}0}-1}3}2/15/2011}This place was really overrated.  My fiancee and I went for Valentine's expecting an incredible menu of extremely unique and delicious things.  Overall the meal was fine, it just wasn't 4-5 stars great like everyone else seems to think it was.The service was great and that certainly went a long way, especially on a major holiday.  I loved that the waitress put a lot of effort into finding a great quality sake that we would like in our price range and then let us sample two before deciding.  That definitely bumps my experience up.On to the food:We ordered 6 plates, two deserts and a half bottle of sake between us and our total including tip was $145.  KAMO ROAST (Chilled Roasted Duck) - This was really good and a lot more meaty and hearty than most duck dishes I've had before.  I'd get this again for sureMAGURO YAMAKAKE (Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam)- The tuna had a somewhat fishy taste.  Very mediocreGYU MISO NIKOMI (Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish)- Extremely delicious.  By far the best thing we had.  I could eat 10 of these.  HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA  (Cold Noodles Served with Soy Dipping Sauce) - very bland.  Tasted like the pasta any college kid would make, stuck in the fridge and covered in soy sauce.  Extremely dissapointingSAKE OYAKO DON (Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe on top of rice) - The roe was really good and the fish was solid.  It was missing something though, and overall was kind of a dry bland bite,ONIGIRI (Rice Balls topped with Spicy Cod Roe)- Another strike out.  I guess i expected something more than a big pile of rice with some roe on top of it.  The roe itself was very good, but it was nothing specialWe also had the chocolate sufflee and the black sesame creme brulee.  Both were again, solid, but far from spectacular.  The chocolate sufflee tasted very average.  The creme brulee was a fine creme brulee, but not life changing like the other yelp reviews would lead you to believe.Overall it was just a very meh meal.  There are so many better, significantly cheaper meals than this in New York.  I can't imagine why I would return here again.
Matthew C.}Los Angeles, CA}0}18}0}-1}5}2/12/2011}Food: As a previous reviewer wrote, just tell your server (we sat at the bar so I'm not sure if this option is available at a table) "omakase" along with some general preferences and you'll be treated to a fantastic dining experience. My friend and I had whitefish with ponzu sauce, eggplant, seared kobe steak, codfish, steak on a hot rock, udon noodles, a chocolate souffle, and a coffee jello for about $65 a person. Pricey, but reasonable for the quality of food.Service: Very good. The server was polite and accommodating, though he was sometimes hard to understand and needed me to repeat what I was saying a couple of times. Other than that the food arrived quickly and our tea and water was refilled automatically.I also would recommend making a reservation at least a few days in advance -- I believe I got lucky calling in just the night before.Other factors that push this restaurant from 4 stars to 5 are its ambience (beautiful decor) and presentation of food.
Jett T.}Queens, NY}8}66}0}-1}4}2/10/2011}Its about time that I review this place.  I've been here who knows how many times and have left satisfied and happy each.Lets start at 5 stars.Deduct half a star for dry chicken meatballs (consistently dry).Deduct half a star for occasionally slow service.Everything else, wonderful!  Its an elegant izakaya worth the walk down the stairs.
Wil F.}Santa Barbara, CA}172}211}104}-1}4}2/8/2011}Great casual atmosphere in the basement of an office building. Wonderful food. Seasonal Sashimi app was fantastic. Chicken with sea salt and citrus chile puree - YUM!Oreo coffee jello with vanilla ice cream was interesting and worth trying.
Dan W.}Bethel, CT}31}5}3}-1}4}2/6/2011}What a great find! Thank you fellow Yelp members. This is an ideal spot for anyone commuting out of Grand Central Station. A 5 minute walk brings you into another world. It is a bit tricky to find. I was looking for a basement entrance from the street.I ordered a dish of duck with scallions. I am no expert on Japanese cuisine but the flavor of that duck was.....well it's all it's quacked up to be!The small serving size was not what I' m accustomed to so I had to savor every bite. They have a huge sake selection but unfortunately I also have some serious driving ahead of me. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try some sake. So glad I found Sakagura!
Kati Y.}Manhattan, NY}75}39}0}-1}3}1/29/2011}I think this place is overrated. With the average wait time of approx. 1 hour. All the dishes we tried, about 10 or so, were very delicious, but I have a hard time justifying the wait time + price. All in all, I think it's a great place for business meals, but not somewhere I'd go on a weekly basis for some chow time with close friends.
Jason C.}Rockville, MD}333}493}671}18}4}1/23/2011}Sakagura?  A NYC sake bar? wha? Coming from DC where there is NO decent Japanese restaurants OR a sake bar for the matter, I didn't hesitate to try this place out after seeing that it had 4.5 star reviews from yelp.  So how good is a 4.5* place in NYC? Pretty damn good.Atmosphere: The interior design in a lot of hip Japanese restaurants and bars in the US give a fake "western-fusion" type of feel.  Sakagura reminded me of a traditional sake bar in Japan with an authentic contemporary twist.  I loved it.Sake: I'm no sake expert and for the most part, my experiences have been limited to Junmai sake.  Do I know all the subareas of Junmai? Nope...so...I had to go with the recommendations of the server.  Was it pretty good? Yes. Was it the best? No.  Did I spend everything in my bank account for it? No.  So in the end, I can't be too critical about this.Food: Sashimi platter was a mix bag.  The uni was an absolute standout and was probably the best uni that I had in the US and I mean THE BEST. The rest of the sashimi platter? Eh....very good but still not comparable to the best I've had in Japan.some other things that were ordered that were standouts:GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI :  Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato,Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms  $12.50Sliced beef....(it's not on the website menu).  This was the standout dish along with the uni in my opinion.One thing I found was very interesting about this place is the way they pour sake into your boxed cup.  Sake is overpoured into the box and is allowed to overflow into the dish below the box.  I have never seen this done before.  I guess there is still something new to learn from Japanese restaurants and sake bars...So in sum......I would have to give this place 4.5*...can't quite give it a 5* b/c the some of the sashimi slices were slightly lower than my expectations but everything else was simply fantastic.
Amy N.}San Francisco, CA}477}110}15}-1}5}1/20/2011}One of the best Japanese "tapas" places I've been to.  We ordered so many dishes that I can't remember all of them.  But the ones that stood out in my mind the most were Gyutan Yawaraka Ni (beef tongue stewed in miso) and the pork belly.  The beef tongue was so tender and flavorful and pork belly is just fatty goodness.  The sashimi is very fresh but I only wish the slices were larger.  The sake list is substantial and complements your meal very well.  Be prepared to spend a bit since these dishes are small and might not immediately fill you but every bite is well worth it!
Stephanie H.}Irvine, CA}367}84}44}-1}5}1/19/2011}Tastings are a foodie's best friend and I think a Japanese Izakaya is a perfect type of restaurant with its small plates and sake/beer.  My boyfriend and I came here during our first trip to New York together on our last night. All weekend we've spoiled ourselves with amazing food so we're not expecting any less on our last night.  We pull up to the address in a taxi and it's this random office building but the address was right. You have to make your way to the basement as their are some inconspicuous signs for the restaurant.  You kinda doubt yourself as you're walking down that this is really a highly rated restaurant situated in an old building in the BASEMENT with gross steps but once you open the door I feel like I walked into Japan.  The decor was very nice with traditional Japanese wooden interior.  We stared at the menu forever because there's so many plates with detailed descriptions. The waitress helped us out with some suggestions and also recommended a particularly good sake which I don't remember the name of and we ordered a half bottle. I didn't think that would be much but it was definitely hard to finish by the end of the night...To start off we got the ebi stick, hirami ponzu, tori karage, and pork belly. My favorites were definitely the hirami ponzu and pork belly! These portions are also generous IMO.  The hirami ponzu was about 8 pieces of fluke sashimi with some bomb daikon radish and ponzu sauce. It was one of the best tasting sashimi appetizers I've ever had. The pork belly was a large square piece in a very yummy stew. It was a lot bigger than it looked and than I expected so definitely order just one if you're eating other things. Our next batch of plates were their special of the day scallops, minced pork and shrimp (which was basically shumai), grilled eel with cucumber and seaweed, and beef tongue. The scallops were very tasty and fresh. They were covered in egg yolk and had cucumbers on the side. This is the second time I've ever had raw scallops too. The first time was the night before in another New York restuarant. Didn't know it was so common! Another favorite was the very tender beef tongue. Unfortunately this came out last and we were so full we could only eat a part of it =[ For dessert we ordered the black sesame ice cream with black sesame creme brulee which was just as delicious and satisfying as everything else. This is defintely a must visit restaurant in NYC. I suggest getting more of the specialty meat dishes like the beef tongue, pork belly, and try their unique cold dishes! This place also has one of the biggest sake collections for you sake lovers!
Gennadiy C.}Oceanside, NY}3}21}4}-1}4}1/19/2011}Great place. Hidden in the basement of some office building. Amazing selection of sake, excellent Japanese food. The food is "really Japanese", a bit different from what you may be used to from your local sushi place...I loved it.
Thy L.}Seattle, WA}124}250}136}-1}3}1/17/2011}First off, let me say that I don't have very refined taste. I don't need my food to look like a piece of art for me to eat it. As long as the flavors are there, I'm a happy camper. Anyway, Sakagura is a nice little restaurant that is located in a very unassuming location. It looks like a dull office building on the outside with no yummy food to offer. You actually have to go in, take the stairs down to the dungeon, I mean... basement. Lo and behold, there's this beautiful little Japanese tapas and sake bar right beneath the street.We ordered a huge variety of things since it was all small plates. So I'll just tell you what my favorites were:1) Gyu Miso Nikomi - I'm sure the name doesn't explain itself. It is basically beef back ribs stewed in miso. The meat was really juicy, soft and savory.2) Buta Kakuni - I love pork belly, enough said. 3) Black Sesame Creme Brulee - definitely delicious. You can't get this at many other places. If you're here you should definitely try it. Everything else was okay. This is one of those places where you spend over $50 a person and you still feel hungry at the end of the night. I probably won't come back again unless they let me order only the black sesame creme brulee :)
Catherine T.}San Francisco, CA}18}68}48}-1}5}1/17/2011}Food: delicious. All the plates we had were good! I love their sashimi kimchi don - sooooooooo good: very flavorful and the right amount of kimchi and fresh sashimi. Their udon were good too - clean, fragrant, simple. Beef tongue was flavorful and tender. Their steamed egg custard and chicken karaage was the only dish that was good but not spectacular. Desserts: Mochi cake with red bean soup - nicely balanced without being too sweet. Black sesame creme brulee - so good. i love black sesame! Sake we had was good too - don't remember the name :(Will definitely be back for the sashimi kimchi don.
Kelly H.}Manhattan, NY}134}18}39}-1}5}1/17/2011}One of my favorite Japanese restaurant of the past 7 years! Consistency quality! I've tried almost everything on the menu.. My absolutely must have : daikon salad, chawanmushi (egg custard but only sakagura makes it like this), miso beef and the pork belly (make sure to get rice w them) dont bother w the sushi there, focus on the home style cuisine that's the moat special thing about sakagura other than their huge collection of sake!!
Adam M.}Philadelphia, PA}7}20}0}-1}5}1/17/2011}Great meal at Sakagura last night. Wonderful Saki pared with great food. Really enjoyed the eggplant, fried chicken, squid and extremely fresh Uni. The deserts were also very good.
Cherry C.}Sacramento, CA}5}17}39}-1}5}1/9/2011}Oh I absolutely adored this place! The restaurant itself is hidden in the basement of a corporate building, so it may be a bit tricky to find but definitely worth the search. Once entering the building, simply notify the concierge that you're headed to Sakagura & they're more than happy to direct you.I loved the decor. Very homely, intimate and mellow ambience. Dim lighting with bamboo everywhere. Definitely takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Now onto the food;UZAKU :  Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed GINDARA YUAN YAKI :  Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy SauceSTEAK cooked on hot stonesBLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream There is not one bad thing I could say about the food. NOT ONE. So everything I've listed is definitely recommended. Bear in mind though that the portions are quite small. So if you're a hungry, hungry hippo, you might want to order accordingly and be prepared to pay handsomely. The eel was cooked to perfection and definitely was my favorite dish of the night. Incredibly light and flavorful. The vinaigrette complimented the eel very nicely. Also, the black sesame creme brulee was one of THE BEST desserts I've ever had in my life! Downside? service was a bit slow but that could be attributed to it being a very busy night. Nevertheless, 5 stars for Sakagura due to their amazing food.
Annie R.}New York, NY}206}430}11}-1}5}1/7/2011}If you are speaking of food, and food alone, this is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Literally incredible.Everything is fresh, and the tastes just wow. I was literally blown away by this food. The Daikon radish with fish roe, amazing. The "Kamo Roast" the chilled duck, I mean literally one of the best things I've ever tasted, I'm salivating just thinking about it. The whole dinner was just so tasty and light, and perfect and I want to go back now. I would give it 6 starts if I could.It is a bit tricky to find you walk into a building, and sort of hang a left, there are no obvious directions....
Julia Y.}Manhattan, NY}28}70}25}-1}4}1/7/2011}Let's see if I can accurately recollect my experiences at Sakagura.  Ok, so it is a hidden away in the basement of an office building, but that just adds to the ambience of the place.  I've been lucky to have had three good dining experiences here (only for dinner though).  I agree that it is a bit pricey but if you have a good reason to celebrate and kick back in a quiet, subdued and charming environment, then come to Sakagura.  They have an extensive sake and drinks menu, though as a light weight, I couldn't really enjoy it all that much.  I did try the plum-flavored sake, which was really sweet.  The small plates are also quite good if you're open to sharing with your group.My memory's a bit hazy, but here's what I can remember trying: jidori shioyaki (chicken, a bit salty but good), chawanmushi (sucker for steamed egg filled with little treats), agedashi tofu (can't go wrong with this), onigiri rice balls (salmon toppings, just ok), soba noodles (refreshing!) and surumeika yaki (squid = yum).  While I didn't have the opportunity to try everything, I made sure to take a stab at the dessert.  I picked the black sesame creme brulee, which was amazing!  I would come back again and be a little more adventurous with the sake selections.
Peng H.}College Point, NY}89}135}6}-1}4}1/4/2011}very very different from other japanese restaurants in the city... i likefood is very freshdecor is awesome, feels very natural w/ all the bamboos service was friendly and quickservings were a little skimpy but if ur on a diet, why not... great food
Wona C.}Las Vegas, NV}35}57}119}-1}4}1/4/2011}I really like this place. For Japanese tapas in NYC, Sakagura is one my favorite restaurants. Everything is delicious. A must-go place, if you are ready for Japanese tapa ing fun in NYC.
Vadim B.}Manhattan, NY}28}35}0}-1}5}1/4/2011}Hidden gem in midtown, excellent food, menu goes well beyond sushi, in fact they specialize in some good authentic Japanese cooking that is so hard to come by in NYC. Probably the biggest sake selection I have ever seen, excellent sampling possibilities.Hard to find, make sure you know the address :-)
Ishan G.}New York, NY}79}168}0}-1}5}1/1/2011}Delicious Japanese small plates.After reading a bunch of reviews my first visit to this restaurant was for lunch with a couple of work colleagues. Was disappointed to the core. The food was nothing great, and the hype and the relatively expensive tab labeled a serious no-no for this placeHowever went here for dinner (31st night) and what a surprise. Its as if the restaurant was schizophrenic. Completely different menus. Had about 12 delicious small plates a bottle of Sake and 3 desserts between 5 of us which cost about 60$ per person. Excellent. Recommendations: Roasted duck, Slices raw squid, Deep fried shrimp rolls, Beef tongue, Spicy Cod fish roeA must try if you are in the mood to share
J D.}Cambridge, MA}0}35}0}-1}4}12/29/2010}Very Japanese feeling restaurant hidden in the basement of a way east side office building, in a street full of car rental garages.  Lots of interesting small plates - e.g.mackerel wrapped rice balls were delicious; and some ordinary ones, like edamame, were unusually good.They have an enormous sake list.  I would definitely return
Nelson W.}New York, NY}440}535}923}18}5}12/26/2010}One word says it all - charming, just absolutely charming. (Not the last three.) The fact that Sakagura is located in the basement of an office building, makes it even more exquisite. Exceptional decor with the bamboo and plants, intimate with the low lights, and fantastic ambiance that appeals to patronage for both business and pleasure. The service is stellar thanks to an attentive and friendly waitstaff.  Whether I come here for lunch, dinner, or simply sake and dessert, the robust menu never fails to impress or run out of things to try. Sakagura serves great tasting food at smaller portions, which leaves one fulfilled without overeating. With that, I can always make room for dessert. The Chocolate Souffle and the Black Sesame Cream Brulee left lasting impressions that kept luring me back time after time. (I can't say anything about the sake since I don't drink enough to know whether the sake is good or not.)Some of my favorite items include: Hiyayakko (chilled tofu) and Tofu Salad; Onsen Tamago (soft boiled egg with sea urchin/salmon roe), Tori Karaage (fried chicken chunks); Gyutan Yawaraka (stewed beef tongue); Homemade Nihachi Soba; and maybe I should just list the entire menu at this point :-)In summary, one star for ambiance, a second one for service, TWO more for the food, and the fifth star for cutting off cellphone reception. Undivided attention for comp anion(s) at the table is just priceless!
Lawrence C.}New York, NY}328}290}5}-1}5}12/23/2010}I don't know the names of anything we ordered because i let the table do the ordering.  There are too many darn things on the menu!  The decor was very traditional japanese, and is a great place to bring friends and family.  I had some short ribs in some type of broth and daikon.  I think this was my favorite dish of the night.  Tender, flavorful, and simple!The uni noodles with an uni broth were a refreshing dish.  The uni was fresh and satisfying, and the broth was able to bring out the sweetness of the uni.The tuna capaccio was very different from what I'm used to having.  They topped it with black and golden roe.  It definitely changed the taste of the fish drastically to a more refined sophisticated flavor.  I'd rather have traditional carpaccio, but it was still an experience.
kristine g.}New York, NY}101}41}0}-1}5}12/19/2010}It's authentic, but creative and definitely yummy.  It's a little hard to find this place. It's tucked away in the basement of an office building.  But once you get there...what a treat.  They have great sake list that you can sample, and the food is delightful on the senses.  We ordered a lot of food:Agedashi TofuOnsen TamagoTori TsukuneShredded Beef RibsSurimeika YakiSaikoro SteakGrilled Japanese EggplantChawanmushiTuna SashimiChocolate SouffleCoffee JelloAll were amazing, this is a place that caters to an exotic palate. Next time I go back, I'll try the sake panna cotta. Get a reservation as the wait can be long, but this is definitely a place to try.
Jessica C.}New York, NY}74}23}0}-1}5}12/12/2010}Mad love for Sakagura. Ive lived in New York for 6 months and ive gone 5 times now. I think that's pretty telling considering the amount of restaurants there are in NYC. What keeps me coming back here? First, its in a fun space, tucked away under a corporate building in midtown east. Once you walk downstairs, its like you are transported to Japan. Second, the food is authentic, and there are many options on the menu. I want to try everything here, and thankfully, the prices are reasonable enough that you can get 4-5 dishes (even for a party of 2). Get reservations. If you dont have reservations and you are a party of 2, they may have a space for you at the bar (which in all honesty, i like sitting at more!)What Ive ordered here:-Agedashi tofu-Chicken meatballs-Shredded beef ribs (this dish is something I would request as a last meal. Its out of this world and I order it every time i go)-Deep fried shrimp roll (comes with a delicious, unique sauce)-Grilled eggplants (im a big fan of eggplants, so this one is a favorite of mine. comes with three different sauces. its a bit of a high price point for tiny slices of eggplant, but its a fave for me)-Karaage-Chicken w/sea salt and yuzu -Salmon roe over rice-Rice balls-Duck wrapped around scallion-Chocolate souffle (my date says it was one of the best choc souffle's he's ever had)-Pear millefuelle-Coffee jello (i was skeptical at first, but a perfect light dessert after a meal)-Red Bean bun
Kirsten P.}Brooklyn, NY}279}259}969}-1}4}12/10/2010}I have eaten at Sakagura about six or eight times. It is beneath the basement of 43rd Street between 3rd and 2nd Avenue, the downsides of the restaurant are the size (which means that it literally feels like you are sitting in a mob bar) and also the very traditional Japanese menu (if you are traveling with non- Japanese individuals). Once my companions were very surprised by the menu. I personally love the variety of sake (the name does mean "sake warehouse" and the restaurant always has winning sake) and the variety of sushi. As for the other dishes on the menu, some of the meat dishes are excellent as well. Be certain to call ahead for a reservation - the seating is limited and the restaurant is always crowded!
David O.}New York, NY}0}15}0}-1}4}12/10/2010}Sakagura is fantastic. Tucked away in the basement of a corporate building in Midtown East on 43rd street between 3rd and 2nd Avenue, Sakagura offers Japanese sets. It is the only place I know to get good soba and cold noodles in NY. It's name (literally "Sake warehouse") explains the decor of sake bales. We also tried some unusal desserts of sake custard and sesame ice cream. Everything was delicious.You feel like you have been transported to Japan and yet don't have jet lag. I can't say that about many of the Japanese restaurants in New York. My Japanese visitors and associates from Japan have verified its quality. Definitely a favorite of mine.
Brad M.}Princeton, NJ}313}514}228}18}5}12/2/2010}Sakagura is probably my favorite place for sushi in Manhattan. There is an excellent choice of sakes that the server will let you sample. While the food and drinks are very pricey, it's well worth your money, and hands down better than Koi, and slightly better than EN. Only negative thing, or positive depending on how you look at it, is that there is no cell phone reception because the restaurant is located in the sub-basement of an office building.
Betty L.}Rancho Cucamonga, CA}56}57}69}-1}4}11/30/2010}Great service, enjoyable dining environment. Their soba is better than Sobaya. Lunch set costs about $20; might be good to give it a try.
aaron r.}New York, NY}42}132}6}-1}5}11/21/2010}I've been here a bunch of times, and I've NEVER been disappointed.  The food and service are always fantastic.  Also, the location makes me feel like I'm in on some awesome culinary secret...which makes me feel REALLY cool when I bring people here.  BTW, for lunch, you can skate out of here for like $20 pp...be prepared to spend ~2x or 3x that amount for dinner.
simon D.}New York, NY}33}26}0}-1}5}11/21/2010}Well short and sweet being a Brit and all !...This really is a great place to sample Sake and delicate Japanese food.Take someone you care about.....
Lei F.}Queens, NY}1}42}18}-1}5}11/9/2010}I absolutely love this place.  I regularly order the tempura soba noodles and it is very filling and always delicious.  The tempura is delicately fried and very light and very good.  Although it's recommended to have a reservation, I've come in early enough where I have not been turned away.  I have actually come all year-round even in the summer.
Ginger A.}Long Beach, CA}399}18}1}-1}4}11/7/2010}In the mood for a fun new experience? This restaurant is definitely a "hidden jewel".  There is another Japanese restaurant on the street which I'm sure confuses people looking for Sakagura.  But, finding this hidden jewel is WELL worth it.A few of the dishes we ordered were "ok".  But, when we ordered the SAKE OYAKO DON : Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Atop a bowl of Rice. AMAZING! So good, we ordered a second serving!!
Victor T.}Austin, TX}24}225}62}-1}5}10/28/2010}Came here on a Tuesday and ordered the Yakizakana Gozen, which consisted of grilled fish, spinach sesame salad, a bowl of rice,  and hot soba noodles. The meal started off with the salad, and I would go there again just for that. It comes with a healthy sprinkle of sesame seeds, and the dressing tastes like the sesame oil/peanut mixture served with shabu shabu. It's a very tiny portion, so I might have to order an extra side on the next visit.While usually not a huge fan of soba noodles, the broth was mild and the noodles were cooked perfectly. A few more servings of this, and I might just become a true convert.The grilled fish was not overcooked, and it was just the right portion for a lunch that will not leave you comatose.Aside from the spinach salad the thing I most enjoyed was the ambiance. LOTS of Japanese office workers go here and it was pleasant to hear barely a word of English spoken.
Tania H.}Austin, TX}55}247}403}-1}4}10/25/2010}This is well hidden in the basement of an apartment bldg.. if it weren't for the Yelp reviews, I might have shied away from finding it... but, it was worth the adventure!  I probably never experienced Japanese food this way and was really happy with my culinary experience.  Our server was really very nice and generous with her time, explaining what it was we were ordering and giving us good recommendations.The food is generally presented as a tapas style so you order lots of little dishes to be shared.Would definitely come back to experience some more..!
Heidi L.}Suffolk, MA}0}3}4}-1}4}10/21/2010}Sakagura was one of the few places that I've been to in NYC and it was amazing!!!! Living in Boston, it's impossible to find an acceptable Japanese restaurant to dine at....I gave it up long ago. Anyways, here's the review.I went there with my family, total 4 of us. We ordered 1) IKA SHIOKARA (it's some raw squid soaked in squid liver and salt. it is VERY delicious but I would recommend this people who love traditional Japanese food only)2) ONSEN TAMAGO (this is a cold soup with sea urchin and raw egg. I think it's just so-so, it has some kind of sweet taste in it)3) FLUKE CARPACCIO (I ordered this based on the reviews on yelp...hmmm, I won't order it again, I don't even remember what it tasted like)4) GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI  (it is beef tongue and its very very tender. I think its one of the best dishes I had at the restaurant)5) HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA "  (buckwheat noodle, it was okay, nothing special)6) SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU (if you love eggplant, its a must order! they have 3 grilled eggplants topped with 3 different kinds of sauce. I love the eggyork one!)We also got some other dishes on the special menu. I personally love the sashimi dish. There were 5 kinds of sashimi, we had salmon, tuna, sea urchin, (forgot the other 2) and they all tasted very good. I requested them to change one of the sashimi and they gladly accomodated, which was nice.
Helen C.}Kirkland, WA}72}81}0}-1}5}10/18/2010}I was visiting from out of town, and originally disappointed because we didn't get reservations at Sushi Yasuda across the street.  My friend had sold it as "5 stars on Yelp from over 500 people" and "must have" sushi.  Since we had already walked all this way, we looked up and down the street and a guy standing outside this apartment building recommended us to try Sakagura.This place doesn't look like much on the outside - in fact it looks like a standard NYC apartment building.  Which is what it is.  We walked down to the basement of the building, and I had flashbacks of doing laundry in my college dorm all over again.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of those doors actually led to a washer & dryer.  Going in, I must say I had pretty low expectations - I mean I started the night thinking I would have 5 star sushi, and now I was eating in a laundromat.  While the waiting area outside the restaurant looks like a laundromat, once you get inside the actual restaurant - it's actually quite nice and comfortable.  Nothing fancy, but clean and mellow.Sakagara has an extensive sake selection and the waitress was pretty knowledgable and able to pick one out for us given our inability to choose one ourself.  The food - is where they knocked my socks off.  A nice combination of raw fish, izakaya, and just homestyle Japanese food.  Portions are small - the two of us ordered 6 dishes and two desserts and needed to be rolled out of the restaurant.  The specials of the day were excellent (Ankimo, and some Scallop dish) - my favorite was the Maguro Tartar.  Make sure to save room for dessert - the Black Sesame Creme Brulee and Pear Millefeuille were SO good. We were both full when we left and were surprised at how inexpensive the meal was - $120 with tax and tip.Thanks Sushi Yasuda for squeezing us out so we could find a gem like this one!Food: 5 starsService: 5 starsValue: 5 stars
Takako T.}New York, NY}69}268}180}-1}4}10/14/2010}Maybe 4.5 stars. The service was good, ambiance is comfortable(nothing fancy, but clean, nice somewhat rustic interior), and food was also good. Not unique or surprising menu, but all the food tasted good. If I were to pick one, I'd recommend fluke sashimi and karaage(fried chicken) which were again, not astonishing but simply tasted good. Unfortunately I'm not big fan of sake, but I enjoyed their beautiful way to serve the carafe sake. Tasteful bamboo bowl filled with ice and flowers for sake carafe made the drinking time happier. Yea, I'll come back!
Chris H.}Hong Kong}173}603}2111}-1}3}10/10/2010}-= To-Do List for Out-of-Town Friend =-1.  Send directions to apt & leave name w/doorman.2.  Central Park, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, etc3.  Dinner at Sakagura4.  (Stretch Goal)  Gawk & Stalk CelebritiesThe food at Sakagura is generally as solid as a rock, and I don't just mean the yuba shumai, which were tough (but not rock solid) and insipid.  Soba is done well, but not as well as Sobaya or Totto.  Tofu salad is a refreshing veg option, but easily forgettable (unlike the unforgettable tofu at EN Japanese Brasserie).  The perfectly cooked and seasoned jidori shioyaki chicken covered for some, but not all of the sins of the miso yakionigiri, which was inedible in its level of salt and clumsiness.In the past several years, i've taken easy-to-impress guests to Sakagura more times than I would care to admit.  Once you get past (literally and figuratively) the oh-so-secret entrance, designed to impress your out-of-town friends, you'll likely have yourself a good, but not great meal.  Here, the food and experience is so reliable, it's almost become boring.
Cici T.}San Francisco, CA}272}443}397}18}5}10/3/2010}Such refined food! I feel.. blissful.It's in the basement of a building, although if you keep a look out you'll find the large sign that will direct you to this wonderous place. The interior of the restaurant is homey with bamboo-like furniture, mellow yellow lighting, and rows of sake for the taking. Not pretentious at all considering the plentiful sashimi, sea urchin, cooked seafood, raw octopus, bright eggplant, crisply fried tofu that's here to please you. Might I add that the restroom has a heated toilet seat to toast your bottom?The Izakaya dishes are perfect for those that want a little taste of everything, for a dance of flavors that together or separately tickle your fancy.The night's dinner order included:-onsen tamago: a soft boiled egg with gooey, flowing egg yolk with sea urchin and salmon roe in a cold, refreshing broth yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…-tofu salad: shredded bright green lettuce and sliced tomato topped with cold, soft tofu and finely chopped salted pickle (an amazing contrast of soft tofu and crunchy pickle!); served with a side of creamy miso dressing yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…-fluke sashimi: served with lemon and a vinaigrette dressing for a slight acidic taste yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…-gindara yuan yaki: grilled cod fish enfused with a sweet miso based soy sauce and accompanied by little bits of sliced mushroom; the fish was thoroughly marinated and the sweet miso soy sauce was integrated fully with the flesh yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…-sanshoku nasu dengaku: six pieces of grilled japanese eggplant, two pieces in each of three kinds of miso , the eggyolk (?), spinach, and sweet red sauce. I didn't taste those distinct flavors, but eat and savor each piece of eggplant slowly and you'll find that the miso sauces are distinct in thickness, creaminess, saltiness, and sweetness. yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…I absolutely loved it at sakagura.
Brian G.}Los Angeles, CA}397}870}49}18}5}9/29/2010}Ah my Sakagura!  We go back, way back like over 10 years.  I've never had a relationship last even half that long.  Your menus have changed over the years, but your sophisticated charm remains the same.The list is quite short, the number of places I've been loyal to for so long and Sakagura is near the top of the short list.  It's hard to stumble into Sakagura given its nondescript location in the basement of a mid-town office building.  The decor is modern yet traditional with surprisingly high ceilings given its underground location.You cannot miss with any of Sakagura's items.  The menu offers both traditional izakaya dishes and offers some modern remakes to keep your tastebuds interested.  But perhaps my favorite thing about Sakagura is their incredible sake menu.  It was at Sakagura that I started my long time love affair for the rice wine.  While the menu can be overwhelming to first timers, my advice is to pick a region or a style (e.g., ginjo, daiginjo, etc.) and sample different varieties to see what suits your fancy.  The descriptions are often as entertaining to read as they are non-informative so go with your tastebuds.  Once you settle into a sake you like know that Sakagura sells by the bottle.  There's nothing better than being a regular and coming back to your well chilled bottle.It can get expensive.  If Sakagura were a mistress, I've shown plenty of affection with the use of my Visa card.  Oh, but Sakagura is worth every swipe.
Michael L.}Houston, TX}116}761}252}18}5}9/25/2010}I walked away impressed.  This place is a must for sake lovers and enthusiasts as well as those who are just getting into sake.  This is a higher end izakaya (japanese pub) of which many can be found on St. Marks but this place has a slightly calmer atmosphere and the food is slightly more refined as well.  Their sake list is extensive, and the menu list isnt as crazy as the other izakaya, meaning they dont offer a million things with items placed randomly on the menu like the other izakayas on St. Marks.  Everything we ordered was delicious, including the dessert.  The Maguro tartar with all that caviar on top isnt as good as the pictures make it, but it was still pretty darn good.  We ordered a grilled eggplant dish with 3 different sauces, and my wife who is an eggplant lover really appreciated it.  It was the SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU : Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso ( Eggyork, Spinach,and Sweet Red ) We also ordered the ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup.  This was a very unique dish, and the broth was superb.  The pork belly dish is also classic and a crowd pleaser; juicy and fatty in a light broth.  The miso cod was also very good and at 9 dollars we got more then we expected which is always welcome!  For dessert the PEAR MILLEFEUILLE with Earl Gray Ice Cream was ordered since we wanted to try something unique.  It was also well received!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough and fruity We spent a little over a 100 dollars for 2, both had drinks and stuffed our faces.  We will be back!
Lucas B.}Buffalo, NY}22}294}5}-1}5}9/21/2010}This was a truly unique dining experience. The location alone is intriguing (the basement of an apartment building. As one of my friends said, there is nothing elegant about the walk down to Sakagura, and you are likely to be confused and lost. The restaurant itself is cool and clean, and designed like an outdoor space, ignoring completely that  it is in a basement. The sake menu is incomprehensibly long for amateurs, but thankfully there are several tasting flights to help you get acquainted with selections. (Be careful basing your bottle choice on your favorite tasting. Our top 2 of 6 were $400 and $200 per bottle.) The food was fantastic. There really is no sushi menu. The menu is arranged like Japanese tapas, and there is a lot of sushi and sashimi throughout. Highlights for us were the salmon over rice and salmon roe, and maguro tartare topped with caviar (which someone else pictured). We also had finely sliced beef cooked on a hot rock (always impressive) and chicken meatballs.Pricing is a negative. The sake menu is very expensive, although there must be a great deal of overhead to maintain such a long list. Also a selection of 5 types of sashimi was $50. This seemed high unless there were 2-3 pieces of each. (I didn't ask, but this would be unusual.) Most menu items were much more reasonable, but just be aware of this.
Annie T.}San Francisco, CA}171}75}0}-1}4}9/21/2010}Bottom Line: Come here for unique Japanese small plates and an impressive selection of sake.Ambiance: A hidden slice of Japan in the basement of a midtown high rise.  They do their best to give an authentic feel.  Case in point: the high tech bathrooms!Food: Selection for food and sake can be a bit daunting.  There were so many delicious things to choose from.  Some favorites: the fried chicken, cold egg and uni soup, tuna sashimi with mountain yam.  For drinks, they offer sake tastings along with what seemed like hundreds of varieties of bottled sake.  We had the sparkling unfiltered sake - very interesting and delicious.Service: Polite and professional.
george t.}Long Island City, NY}8}171}0}-1}5}9/20/2010}Originally planned to give 4 stars. The food was fresh, seasoned well, just a little overpriced and nothing really blew my mind. The sake list was really comprehensive but wayyyyy too overpriced. The decor was interesting but not over the top, and the atmosphere is good for couples or groups alike because the tables are very nicely spaced. Bumped the 4 stars to 5 because the dude sitting two tables from us got on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend, and she said yes. =)
Mahrukh M.}New York, NY}113}114}3}-1}5}9/9/2010}I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food I ordered. And, they have an amazing sake collection. I remember that I really liked the presentation of their food. It's great for going with a group of friends and drinking sake and ordering some small plates. I also enjoyed their dessert. The place seemed very authentic to me. Definitely would go again for a night of sake with friends! :-D
Jaze Z.}Brooklyn, NY}1}77}21}-1}4}9/8/2010}Incredibly good sake selection, delicious food, attentive service in a downstairs basement setting in a nondescript office building. Surprise your out-of-town sake loving friends by taking them to this place. Expensive but worth a least one visit if enjoy sake. Try sitting at the bar if possible - well worth it.
Jeannie L.}North Bethesda, MD}52}367}5}-1}3}9/6/2010}I must say, I had high hopes for this place, which it failed to deliver. While the ambience was nicely understated, the saltiness of the food was definitely over the top.  Every dish would have tasted perfect if they would have be a bit easier w/ that salt proportion.  To compensate, I think I downed 2 big glasses of water and 1 green tea.  But if you want to give it a shot, try their Maguro Tataki (tuna tartar w/ egg roe), chicken meatballs, and ebi sticks.  Those were pretty good.
scott j.}Seattle, WA}125}3}5}-1}5}9/5/2010}Sweetness!!! Amazing Sake list.  Don't come here If you are looking for sushi but if you want authentic elegant japanese food, this is the place in Mid Town.
Kathy L.}San Francisco, CA}236}316}11}-1}5}9/1/2010}Pleasantly surprised by how delicious the beef tongue dish was. Nothing like french kissing a cow... Also enjoyed the poached egg uni dish and the pork belly. Thank god for the pork belly, because I would have never felt full otherwise. I thought the black sesame creme brulee and the red bean sake bun with green tea sorbet were both very unique and delicious. This place has great atmosphere, despite (or because of?) being over a flight down in the basement.
Kathryn S.}New York, NY}55}42}0}-1}4}8/31/2010}Sakagura is not a sushi restaurant and does not pretend to be one.  It is an izakaya, and it is a very authentic one with an endless list of sake (the menu was quite informative), friendly and attentive service and the simple and comprehensive menu.  Uni chawanmushi was very flavorful and was topped with a generous portion of uni.  Onsen tamago was tasty and cooked just right.  White fish sashimi with ponzu was typical but fresh.  Coupled with the light and fruity dewazakura sake (recommended by the waitress), this was one of the best and most fun dinners I've had.  I would definitely go back.
Karen N.}Chicago, IL}45}419}10}-1}4}8/19/2010}The four star is an average.  5 stars for the atmosphere and the sake selection, 3 stars for the food.  There were a few standout dishes, e.g.  the chilled tofu, the stew pork cube.  But really, we enjoyed the atmosphere and giant sake list.  Once you walk in, you feel like you're in Japan!
Ye L.}Riverside, CA}25}132}123}-1}5}8/16/2010}Came here a while back so forgive me for not remember any details about specific dishes. I came for a late dinner on a Saturday night to meet some old friends who I hadn't seen in ages. The entrance to the place is a little hidden and it seemed as if the restaurant was part of the parking garage of this office building. However, the inside was decorated very thoughtfully with very Japanese touches. The waitress was super nice and patient with us as we ordered very indecisively. It was a special occasion so we even went for a nice sake recommendation which true to form was very good. Everything was delicious (and it better have been for the prices!) and I left a little buzzed and very satisfied.
NA}London, United Kingdom}129}60}55}-1}5}8/16/2010}Dream restaurant hidden at the bottom of an unassuming office block.Walk past the security guard (don't forget to smile and tell him where you're going) and take the lift (sorry, elevator) to the basement. Walk through the bamboo door and prepare for a sumptuous banquet of all things japanese, including over 250 types of sake to drink, and the must-have dessert tasting plate. An utterly delicious diversion.
Jerry C.}Houston, TX}82}24}5}-1}5}8/12/2010}Square Pork Belly, Braised Miso Beef Stew are must haves here.  needless to say the Sake selection is unsurpassed.  Good place to bring friends and family from out of town.  Pumpkin beer here isnt bad either.  Cheers.
bunny m.}New York, NY}0}16}0}-1}5}8/9/2010}Excellent Japanese food. I love any of their dishes. If I have to complain, the price is expensive. You should careful to order sake. Some of them are very expensive, however those are expensive sake in Japan too.
Vincent Z.}New York, NY}8}26}0}-1}4}8/6/2010Updatedreview}Great again.. Perfect work lunch spot.  Lunch tasting menu is where it is at.  The desserts are absurd by the way..
Lady X.}New York, NY}0}42}100}-1}3}8/4/2010}Ah, 500. What to review for my 500th yelp? At first I thought I was set, had it all planned out that for my thirty-twelfth birthday, it would be Saka Gura. My hubby and I have done 2/3rds of the magic triangle on E. 43rd St. and would do the best day of the year as well as my 500th yelp at SG. The thing is though this is my 500th, SG was not all that to me and to us. There was nothing wrong with it we just prefer the other two (Soba Totto and Sushi Yasuda) more. First off, I do not think it is unique or fashionable to dine in the dungeon unless that is the point, like London's St. Martin's in the Field's Cafe In the Crypt. I felt claustrophobic and made sure to know where the points of egress were "just in case." I don't mind walking through a lobby area, such as at The Four Seasons, but not one where I am greeted by a nice but grossly underpaid security guard twiddling his thumbs. I like a little more atmosphere. Not walking down a flight of uninspired dirty stairs. And as the evening progressed the clientele became more dressed for an audition of The Jersey Shore. Who goes to nice restaurants wearing high tops, short shorts and/or hoopwear? Not I. That is the fault of the management for letting such riff raff in but I guess in this economy...But perhaps, it all comes down to the fact that I should have done a little more research when I picked SG since I could choose anywhere I wanted for this 30-12 occasion. That is not SG's fault. We are pescetarians so we were limited in what we could order. I have since learned that it is a top sake bar. I am all for sake but we drove in so... And it is not exactly a sushi joint. And I was wanting to be in a sushi way.So we made the best of it and ordered a whole mess of their small dishes, think Japanese tapas, LOL! First though we ordered a carafe of Ichinokura Sake which was presented beautifully but for the equivalent of four cups of sake was outrageously priced at $41! Whatev. Our first dish was Hiyakko, housemade Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito Flakes. It was so soft it was like a custard and a bit awkward to share since it was so mushy it was difficult to maneuver it but it was tasty. Then came the Tatami Iwashi, Dried Sardine Crackers Fried Crisp Served with A Spicy Mayonnaise Dip complete with the little fishies staring back at you when you went to eat it. I loved them but thought the accompanying sauce did not suit them well. I could eat those crackers all day! Yum. :)))My hubby then got the Uzaku, Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed and I am not a big fan of eel like him. He said it was "just alright." I liked the cucumber and seaweed though.The Maguro Tartar, Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviarwas the highlight of the evening though as it was not only super delish but more along the lines of what we had hoped to eat that night. Beautiful presentation as well (see picture). That would be well worth going back for if not for SY across the street. :)Our next to last item was the Jaga Dango, Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp. I think I will stick to Doughnut Plant for donuts in the future. Bland, doughy and not as interesting as I had hoped. The sea salt provided on the side made them more palatable though.Lastly came these giant balls of rice, Onigiri, topped with Spicy Cod Rose. Our ignorance on what to do with them befuddled us until we were able to catch someone's attention to explain we had to roll them ourselves. I mean they were big so I pretty much ate mine deconstructed. The spicy cod roe was spicy (yes!) and provided some flavor to the otherwise bland Onigiri.The service was not as attentive as I have come to expect from upper tier Japanese restaurants. And with the rather depressing basement setting and the lack of some basic dress code, I am afraid all I can offer is 3 stars. Indeed that is different from most other peoples' experiences but not every place is for every one. I do not anticipate a return visit to Saka Gura to sample their other offerings though am glad we tried it. With SY and ST right there and so many other competitive Japanese restaurants to try, Saka Gura just did not do it for us. :(And having just posted my pictures, I noticed that we were served our dishes in the order they are presented on the menu. Perhaps there is some logic in doing that of which, again, I am ignorant. Please enlighten me (you know who M!)!youtube.com/watch?v=KoEc…
Michael S.}Castro Valley, CA}15}226}22}-1}5}8/1/2010Updatedreview}I have been back to Sakagura several times since my first review and it has come to be my favorite restaurant in NY. Everything is prepared perfectly. The stocks are subtle and perfect. The sashimi is always fresh and amazing. The sake menu is HUGE.They use organic and free range stuff, which you can verify by ordering any of their egg dishes. They have the best Oyakodon in the city. Their servers do kind of such at times and if you are not Japanese be prepared to wait and watch Salary men be seated before you when they are obviously walk ins as well.
Helen D.}Santa Barbara, CA}490}1133}30261}-1}3}7/31/2010}I liked that they have salmon sashimi and salmon roe over sea-weedy rice. That would have been the ultimate combo if the salmon roe didn't taste like they were soaked in sugar-water and the salmon sashimi actually tasted like raw salmon. Huh??? Was exactly what my brain said too.My friends ordered cooked items like fried chicken balls, fried potato balls, some kind of sauteed beef and more fried stuff which I sampled and deemed sadly mediocre. Not the items' names, so you know. Anyway, we all know Japanese places aren't known for their portions but COME ON PEEPS!! Shameless, shameless stuff.Anyway, the three stars are for the cultural atmosphere and the mini floral decorative on the table. Service was so-so, mediocre like the food-- borderline sucked. Didn't even bother with dessert.
Linh D.}New York, NY}23}66}0}-1}5}7/31/2010}Hands down my favorite Izakaya Japanese places in NY. I've been here twice and have not been disappointed. I would highly recommend getting the duck dish. can't remember the official name but it's the only duck dish on the menu. The braised pork belly is AMAZING. All in all, you can't go wrong. for those who thinks this place has rolls, go somewhere else (like places in the E vill.)
Jerry P.}Summit, NJ}12}51}24}-1}5}7/27/2010}I am ashamed to say that it took almost 2 years for Sakagura to hit my radar -especially given the fact that I work for a Japanese company, eat Japanese food with expats all over midtown regularly, and am always looking for new Japanese food outlets.  Not to immediately throw out excuses, but It is one of those places in New York that you don't know it's there unless you know it's there (next to the freight elevator in the basement of a nondescript office building in midtown).  Nonetheless, I should have known.  Food is outstanding, atmosphere is great, Sake selection is amazing.  Food prices are extremely reasonable given the quality of the food and the midtown location.
Yann B.}San Francisco, CA}3}18}15}-1}4}7/25/2010}High-end izakaya hidden in the basement of a Midtown office building. HUGE selection of sake... The sake menu is about as thick as wikipedia so I never even attempted to go through it. If you know about sake, I'm sure it's awesome... But I just ask recommendations... which can be dangerous depending on the waiter. Last time I went, I didn't check the price and realized too late the one they recommended was $70 a carafe (a "carafe" is pretty small, you can easily go through 3 of those during a meal). No wonder it tasted so smooth... The bill sure didn't though.It's a sexy place (wouldn't call it romantic), great for a date. But you'll also see sararimen getting wasted there pretty often...As for the food, I won't recommend anything in particular because basically you can't go wrong. Everything is delicious. But that's also why it gets only 4 stars and not 5: I can't really single out one specific item on the menu that stands out from the rest.That said, I've been there a few times and I look forward to go back there every time. You should definitely check it out if you like izakaya style, it's one of the better ones in the City.
J. L.}New York, NY}0}120}0}-1}4}7/23/2010}It's been discovered, and now far less pleasant than it used to be, especially on weekend nights.  But still good.
Devin C.}San Jose, CA}51}22}11}-1}5}7/23/2010}Went to this restaurant with my girlfriend after finding stellar reviews on Yelp.  Great restaurant with fantastic food and wonderful service.  They had non-traditional American Japanese cuisine but everything we tried we loved.  My favorite dish was a deep friend tofu in a yummy broth.  I also give this place one extra star because they serve green tea ice cream.
Peter K.}Palo Alto, CA}1}15}0}-1}5}7/23/2010}Sakagura serves real Japanese food - the way the Japanese have it.  The cooks really care about what they serve there and it's easy to tell.  No tricky gimmicks to attract the more naive crowd.  Just authentic Japanese food.Almost any dish here is worth trying.People who don't like the food here just don't get it - they should stick to fast food; save the Japanese caviar for those who know.
Annie B.}New York, NY}34}130}12}-1}4}7/20/2010}This is more of a high end Japanese tapas restaurant than a sushi bar. The atmosphere is classy and the decor is simple, detail orientated, and embodies a sense of serenity that is characteristic of the Japanese culture. The dishes range from $6 to $16 but they are tapas portions so prepare to order about 3-4 dishes per person for dinner. I would say this restaurant is ideal for a business dinner or a weekday date. Very nice.Their sake selection was amazing. They have a little side room to hold all the chilled alcohol. Order a bottle and your wine is chilled in a mini bamboo bathtub looking bucket decorated with bamboo and white babies breath. The food is creative and authentic at the same time. Here are my recommendations:-The beef on a stone pot that is being offered as part of their summer special is awesome. It was delicious and so entertaining to eat. Raw slices of beef, a piece of fatty beef, and a stone pot are presented. The piece of fatty beef is used to coat the stone pot (one side was the coat, one side was to clean) prior to cooking each individual slice. It's served with a ponzu sauce as well as sea salt. Yummy.-Seared toro with a ponzu sauce. Generally I don't like toro because I don't like the fatty flavor that lingers on your tongue but this toro was delicious. It was light and flavorful and the toro still had that characteristic marbleized texture. -The tuna tar tar with two types of caviar was another one of my favs. Paired with the cucumbers and it was refreshingly delicious. Imagine a small cylindrical mound of tuna tar tar topped with a yin-yang decoration of black and yellow caviar. Cucumbers circle the cylindrical mound. -The fatty pork in broth was tender and delicious. It's a square slab about 3inx3inx3in but I would recommend sharing this. It's a bit on the heavier side.-The choc souffle and green tea ice cream is delish!Two things I didn't like: The Iku Shiokara which is a raw squid chilled in salt and squid liver marinade. The liver marinade just made it taste unfresh. The soba noodles, although hand made, just wasn't remarkable. I'd stick to the other dishes.Enjoy!
Alex S.}New York, NY}95}34}10}-1}1}7/20/2010}Totally unimpressed. After reading a ton of the reviews of this place, I expected a lot. I found our waiter to be bat-shit stupid, the food was hardly edible, reading and actually understanding what the hell the menu was talking about was frustrating, and I nearly died of thirst waiting for someone to refill my glass.At least I was in good company, or else I might have stuck my face onto the hot stone that my friends steak came on. For the high price, there are literally thousands of other places in NYC that will give you better service, higher quality food, and superior ambiance... save your loot.
Thomas A.}Watertown, MA}302}844}371}18}4}7/20/2010}My ex-boss wanted to take me here a year ago, but we ended up going to Donburi-ya. I finally checked this place out with a group of friends. I found out that Anthony Bourdain checked out this place in an episode of No Reservations. This place is 1st of all hard to find because it's in a work building. Inside the work building, you take a set of stairs downstairs and you enter a new world like as if you walked through the magical closet in the CS Lewis novels. We had a party of 8, and we only had to wait a few minutes to get seated. The place looks small but it actually is pretty spacious. The place has a very old school Japan look. The rustic look makes it feel like you traveled back to the old school of Japan. The food is tapas style. We ordered a bunch. We tried the IKA SHIOKARA : Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade. This was probably the worst dish that we ordered. It wasn't actually that bad. The 1st few bites were fine, but i got tired of it rather quickly due to the fact that it was pretty bitter, most likely from the liver marinade.IKURA OROSHI : Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe. This was acually a very refreshing dish, a palate cleanser i suppose. It was very tasty. ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup. This was really good too. The boiled egg was cooked beautifully, and it really went well with the sea urchin, salmon roe and the soup when it was all mixed together. HIRAME PONZU : Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a CitrusVinaigrette. FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf.  These both fluke sashimi dishes were quite pleasant and refreshing. GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato,Spinach, and Shiitake Mushroom. This dish was awesome. THe beef tongue was so tender. Tongue is hard to cook because you can make it very tough, but this was just so tender it was softer than filet mignon. This was probably my favorite dish. MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar. This tasted great too but it was rather small.JIDORI SHIOYAKI : Grilled Organic Free Range Chicken Served with Sea Salt and "Yuzu" Citrus Pepper. This was my 2nd favorite dish. It was actually our group's favorite dish. It was so good that we ordered a 2nd order of it. THe chicken was moist and flavorful. The sea salt and the citrus pepper complemented the chicken perfectly. We ordered more, but to be honest, i don't remember what we got. I just remember the food was soo good, and i lost track of all the foods that we ordered. I only remembered most of them because I took pictures.
mardou o.}New York, NY}7}46}0}-1}5}7/18/2010}Amazing and intensely satisfying.  Really.  We had a sake trio, hot and cold appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  Yes, we really porked out.  How could you not at a place that serves dishes that are unique, thoughtful, and so delicious.  Your taste buds will suddenly feel awakened and wonder why you don't come here more often.  I remember the uni cold soba and still dream about it from time to time.  If you're looking for that 1 great Japanese meal to splurge on, come here and you won't be disappointed.
Scott W.}Brooklyn, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}7/13/2010}Friendly service; tons of Japanes patrons and a Japanese din.  Felt like I was back in Japan.  Quirky basement location makes it even more fun. The tendon set for lunch was nice -- delicious rice and lightly battered, freshly prepared tempura.  The cold soba was refreshing on a hot, humid day. Best Japanese restaurant I've been to in years.
Tampa D.}New York, NY}3}211}1}-1}5}7/11/2010}My Japanese hair stylist recommended this place to me, and it took me a while to make it up there, but it was worth the trip. The sake list is fantastic, and the food is excellent Japanese country style stuff. But my fond memory is fresh wasabi, which you grate yourself as you need it on a teeny little grater.
Lily T.}New York, NY}686}911}719}18}4}7/9/2010}Came here on a Tuesday night.  We didn't have reservation but was seated within 15 minutes. the place is very cute. Kind of hard to find since it's underground. the service was very good. Our waiter was very friendly and explained the many different kinds of sake and recommended some sake for us. Forgot what dishes we got but everything came out in very small portions and everything tasted every fresh. It is definitely not cheap tho, the sake were all quiet pricy at about $40 to share between two people and above couple hundreds for a bottle.the toilets they have here is super cute. It's one of those automatic ones that cleans you. and you can choose to clean the front of behind. Will definitely come back here again
Garota N.}New York, NY}0}10}0}-1}5}7/7/2010}Absolutely yummy.  Great izakaya.  Fab Japanese tapas and sake selection.  Perfect if you're willing to try traditional dishes... beyond conventional sushi.
Jennifer Y.}Brooklyn, NY}7}8}1}-1}5}7/6/2010}My friends and I went for a going away/birthday party and it was amazing. The wait staff was very attentive, we ordered a bunch of dishes and they would serve them to us once at a time so we weren't cluttered with dishes. The chicken teriyaki meatballs were divine. Moist and tender with a wonderful sauce.The chef's special of the stewed pork was delectably tender and flavorful.The ebi stick was crunchy and delicious.The fried mashed potato dipped donut batter was fried to perfection but didn't taste much like potato, imo. Tasted mostly of the batter.The fried chicken marinated in sake and ginger was ok.The filet mignon on hot stone was fun and delicious!The miso yakionigiri was orgasmic, as a friend described it.And last but not least, dessert. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle which was amazing. It was light and went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream and the raspberry sauce.All in all, it was a great experience and I'd definitely like to go back.
Ha R.}New York, NY}0}60}0}-1}5}7/4/2010}Awesome food and great service.Confusing to get to , for first timers, as its in the basement.
Jay S.}Carrboro, NC}104}17}0}-1}4}7/3/2010}can't speak for the food, but the bar area is very quant. the bartender was very attentive and helped me pick out a rice whiskey. i respect a bar that has one decisive beer on tap. here its sapporo, of course. served in chilled hand-thrown clay cups. wonderful.

J M.}New York, NY}54}65}167}-1}5}6/28/2010}my friend took me here for my birthday.  I can't even single out anything that was just ok.  Everything that we ordered was so good and beyond a 5 star rating.  I m not normally a small plates places type of girl.  I like to have a big steak in front of me to make it good.  The cooking is very home-y and delicious.
Sandy C.}New York, NY}367}544}1513}-1}4}6/21/2010}We are eating once again. We as in Jimmy C, Jenn L, Wing L, Will C and his girlfriend. I mean what is there better to do than eat 24/7? Well naps are good too. So we arrived in front of this office building, got to the security desk and he looked at us, but no questions were asked and we proceeded towards the door way. The doorway led us down to the basement of this building and upon opening the door we felt like we were in a whole different world. It's something like A Wrinkle In Time, except we are not on a quest to look for Mr. Murry, but on a quest to feed our stomachs.We were seated rather quickly and we all looked at the menus. I don't know was it just me or did others get a little crossed eye from looking at this menu. There were so many things to choose from, but they were not categorized in any way to let us know what we were looking at. All the foods were very small portion, which seems like majority of the menu is made up of appetizers. There were some normal size portion foods, but we didn't really know which ones they were.With the 6 of us we ordered what seem like a feast, but it's a very small portion feast.ONSEN TOMAGO - a soft boiled egg with sea urchin and salmon roe in cold soup. This was pretty interesting because the sea urchin was squishy in this cold broth.UZAKU - grilled eel with vinaigrette served with thin cucumber slices and wakame seaweed. This dish was very flavorful, which I liked a lot.JAGA DANGO - Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp. This consisted of 4 fried dough's, but it was nothing too special about this particular dish.FLUKE CARPACCIO - Thin Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf. The fluke was thinly sliced and was very fresh.CHAWANMUSHI - Steamed Egg Custard Served with Chicken, Shrimp and Gingko Nuts Topped with a thickened Ponzu Sauce. I ordered this dish because the name was just so darn cute. This was pretty good, but the egg custard reminds me of a Chinese dish at home.KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON - Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over rice. This dish was normal portion size and it was really good and not spicy at all.On the special menu, which I can't find the names on-line that we had ordered:Scallop with mango sauce - if you guessed if I ordered this dish then you guessed correctly. I love scallop and mango, so this was a must get for me. The scallop was fresh and the mango sauce only had a hint of mango flavor, so this dish was okay.Imported octopus, which had a springy texture to it. It was very fresh and it was pretty good.Steak with a hot stone, which I have seen on some travel shows and always wanted my very own hot stone to cook with. But never seen one in person until that night. Wing broke his stone because it stopped working for him, while he was cooking his steak on it. Luckily for Will's stone that was still functioning. This dish was interesting because of the stone, but the steak was just okay.There were some other things on the special menu we had ordered, but I don't recall the names, but I have pictures =)There were some interesting dessert selections at this restaurant, so we had to try some.CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with Vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce, which the soufflé was very soft and fluffy. I like the soufflé a lot and the ice cream was just ice cream.BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream - my other weakness aside from mango. I really really like black sesame! So I definitely ordered this dessert. This dessert was incredibly delicious!       PEAR MILLEFEUILLE with Earl Gray Ice Cream, this dessert was pretty good too. The pear went really well with the flakey cookie and the earl gray ice cream was really good.COFFEE JELL-O, which is Coffee Gelatin Dessert with Vanilla Ice Cream. This dessert was okay. I'm not really a fan of coffee. But this dessert looked really cute because the ice cream looked like a little turnip.Sea Salt Chocolate Sorbet, which was okay as well. I didn't find this dessert to be too special since I've had sea salt sorbet before.Again all the dishes were quite small resembling appetizer-like dishes and they were somewhat on the pricey side. But I think it's a pretty neat place to check out because of where it is located, the unique foods here and of course the bathroom. How can I not include this in my review. Well the bathrooms were interesting because they were kind of hidden next to the wall. Also, the toilet that has a controller attached to the wall for various cleaning and drying activities...Japanese people, they are so clever and witty! And honestly, I was afraid I did not know how to flush the toilet, but luckily there was a huge arrow with the word "FLUSH" indicating which button is to flush. And our quest to feed our stomachs concludes here, until next time.
Lawrence C.}New York, NY}82}215}0}-1}5}6/18/2010}No matter how many white-bread friends of yours come up to you and say, "I went to this awesome place last week, Saragaku or something?"... No matter how many writeups it gets in the mainstream, or how many Yelp reviews it accrues... There will ALWAYS be something cool about entering a barely marked, slightly scuffed building lobby and going down a dirty stairway into the den of potential high-class iniquity that is Sakagura.Unlike many an obscure entrance (PDT's phone booth, the Burger Joint's orange curtain, La Esquina's kitchen odyssey, etc.), Sakagura's registers as more than a mere gimmick, since the restaurant itself has a furtive vibe that justifies the discreet entrance. It's of a piece with the establishment in a way that renders novelty obsolete.But what good is a killer opening salvo without the food to back it up? Sakagura cannot provide the answer to that question, at least not for me: it happens to be the place (along with Sushi Yasuda across the street) that jump-kicked my keen enjoyment of Japanese cuisine into full-blown obsession.Consider this: The onsen tamago, or "hot springs egg", is a common enough dish at hot springs in Japan -- an egg is simmered in a dashi broth at hot-springs-water temps, where it acquires a kind of soft-boiled/poached sheen. But it's virtually nonexistent on NYC menus, so for Sakagura to have it at all is a wonder. For them to up the ante by adding a tongue of uni and spoonfuls of salmon roe is brilliance: the subtle backdrop of the dashi broth is sharpened by the brine of the roe, the sea breeze of the urchin, all in service of this gorgeously heat-touched egg whose yolk bleeds into the dashi in wisps and whorls.The sanshoku nasu dengaku is three thin slices of eggplant, each topped with a different dollop of miso-based sauce. Very elegantly plated, very pure, very simple. You might think almost too simple, but then you take a bite of that perfectly grilled eggplant, accented by the yolk, or the spinach, or the sweet red sauce, and you're reminded once again that Japanese cooking technique need not take a backseat to the French, or anyone else.How about the buta kakuni, i.e., braised pork belly? Refinement is dropped here in favor of sheer Pig, the meat falling apart in a way that still frustrates my chopstick skills even after all these years. Sweet and salty and juicy and fatty, Sakagura's version is my gold standard not only of that particular luscious dish, but of all pork belly preps, period.Shall I go on? A recent hotate special, a scored, barely cooked scallop, had one of the most refined mayonnaise sauces I've ever tasted. Sliced of lightly fried whitefish sounds like a mistake -- the cold side of the menu? -- but isn't at all once it's dressed with a sweet vinegar marinade and pickled daikon. Hirame ponzu, or thinly sliced fluke sashimi in a citrus-soy sauce, is fanned out on the place like a glistening sunburst, with grated daikon for once imbued with umami, somehow. All are plated like miniature works of art, the details sweated out relentlessly into a Zenlike rarefaction.There are, as always, imperfections. The miso soup is oddly smoky.  A grilled tilefish proves slightly dry. Tori karaage (fried chicken) errs with too much crust. In fact, I stand by my assessment in an earlier Yelp, that Aburiya Kinnosuke has the more consistent menu. And sure, you can bet that I'll be in full-on rhapsodic mode whenever I get around to revisiting Zenkichi for a proper review.But in the decade that has passed since I first descended that dank staircase, as increasingly authentic izakayas and the like have popped up throughout the city, I have still not found a Japanese small-plates spot that is unequivocally a more complete, transporting experience.A seemingly unrelated quote from Salon: "Johnny Depp is as close to being a '30s-style movie star as we've got these days... [offering] a peculiar mix of star quality laced with pathos: Even as he flashes that instant charmer of a smile, there's also something gaunt and haunted about him, as if he were living his life in reverse, as if he already knows how it's all going to end."There's something about Sakagura's darkly sleek lines, its handsomely understated bar, its cozy booths that recalls much the same feeling -- the sense that its walls have witnessed things much beyond its decade and a half of actual existence, yet will remain forever mute about it. And just as Depp successfully resisted the pretty-boy stereotype pushed upon him early in his career, Sakagura will always transcend any attempt to pigeonhole it as simply an exotic, romantic hideaway. Sakagura ranks with Peter Luger, with Katz's, with Per Se as an exemplar of its class, an experience that simply cannot be missed if you have the time and means to visit it.Man, I didn't even mention the sake.Probability of return within 1 year: 90%
Cindy T.}Elizabeth, NJ}135}46}1}-1}5}6/18/2010}Went here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. We were lucky enough to get last minute reservations. The food was amazing!The number one thing I look for in a restaurant is if their staff matches the ethnicity of the food they're trying to portray.EVERYTHING is JAPANESE here!The restaurant has a huge selection of sake. You know the restaurant is good if you see Japanese businessmen there. The menu is pretty authentic. Mostly small dishes and no real entrees.We ordered the seasonal sashimi selection and OMG it had the best uni I've ever had in my life. The uni was wayyy better than the uni at Sushi Yasuda. WAY BETTER. But you don't really go to Sakagura for the sushi, you go for everything else.I can't remember everything we ordered but our table was not big enough. I highly recommend this place.Don't forget to finish off with the black sesame brulee. It's delicious. I'm a fan of all things sesame.
Edward B.}San Francisco, CA}2}22}1}-1}5}6/17/2010}I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the uniqueness of the dining experience. If you take each individual plate by itself, I've had better dishes and it's probably a 4 star, but when you take into account the collection of Japanese dishes it makes for great dining experience. This is a place to go if you like different experiences and distinctive dining.  If you're looking for a sushi joint with rolls named after local landmarks this isn't the place for you. I think a good metric to determine whether you'll really like this place or not is: Do you think Uni is an exotic dish? If yes you might not like this place, if no then you'll really like this place.
Wing L.}Brooklyn, NY}454}371}2028}-1}4}6/17/2010}Who knew that there is a gem of a place who's entrance is hidden among the corridors of a nondescript building?  If it weren't for a sign outside you would never be able to tell it's there at all.  The doorway leads you to a plain stairway that goes straight down the basement and into what seems like a totally different world.  Once through the door downstairs the place sudden morphs into a what feels like a Japanese village/restaurant.  They even had a freakin mini village gate entrance by the door going into the dining area. Awesome!!!!   yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…The menu is a clusterf%#k of  a lot of items to choose from so be prepared to stare at it for a long time trying to figure out what to order if it's your first time here. Hell, I think I became cross eyed from looking at the menu for so long.  To me the menu could have been organized in a more comprehensible manner because there was no clearly defined appetizers, small plates, and entrees.  Took our group of 6 more than a few moments to figure out what to get.  I have to admit the server was more than patient with us whenever he came back time after time and we said we weren't ready yet.  After awhile I just kind of gave up and ordered whatever sounded exotic or interesting (with a bit of ini mini miny moe thrown in for good measure).  I ended up eating:Appetizer: UZAKU : Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed.  This was so delicious.  The vinaigrette brings a nice sharp sour bite to the ingredients while the wakame salad brings a snap and a crunchiness to the dish when eaten together with the eel and cucumber.  5 stars      yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…Entree: Can't find the name online but it's a special menu item with slices of raw steak that comes with a very hot rounded stone.  You place the steaks on the stone yourself and it cooks the meat to your liking.  Kind of like a BBQ grill... but with a rock.  How cool is that?  Anyway, I think they gave me a defective rock ( Time to call mother nature for a refund ) because halfway through cooking my steaks, it started to fizzle and barely cooked the meat.  Another dining companion that ordered the same dish had it sizzling and steaming till the very end.  I had to borrow his stone to finish the rest of my steaks  =/     It tasted good (but kind of ordinary since it's basically grilled steak meat) with the accompanying soy sauce based dipping sauce.  I think it's more for the experience which is kind of fun and entertaining. 4 stars.   yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…   yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…Dessert: CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with Vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce:  The souffle was incredibly soft and light.  The raspberry sauce comes in a separate glass cup that you pour over the ice cream and souffle to your own taste.  The ice cream was good but nothing too special taste wise considering it's just vanilla flavored.  The raspberry sauce gives it a nice sweetness to it.  4.5 stars  yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…We all tasted each others dishes but since there was 6 of us and most of us ordered 3 dishes each, there is simply too many dishes for me to mention all of them in this review. There is two I do want to tell everyone about though.(1)BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream.  Many reviewers recommends this dessert and for good reason.  Yummy!!!     yelp.com/biz_photos/7iY3…(2)JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp.  Very few reviewers talks about or recommends this dish and for good reason.  It's doughy and kind of tasteless.  Boring!!!One last thing to mention.  Most of the portion size are pretty tiny so if you are really hungry that day, avoid this place ( My 19 dollar steak entree came only with 6 small slices of meat).   Either that or be prepared to buy a lot of dishes in order to fill your tummy.  The rice dishes and the noodle dishes seems to be the best value size wise for dinner time.  I would give the place a 5 but I left the place still hungry after spending a little over 40 bucks for myself from this meal.   Then again I tend to eat a lot so maybe I'm not the best judge of portion sizes =)
Jennifer C.}Elmhurst, NY}545}626}1298}18}4}6/15/2010}This place is special in more ways than one. A foodie friend in the know brought us here after a birthday dinner ringing in his 28th. I had never heard of Saka-Gura before so this was a new experience for me. I liked that we had to enter a hybrid residential/commercial-like building and walk down a flight of stairs to enter this dark and dungeony oasis of booths, and four-tops seated with Japanese food aficionados. I felt like I was in on a very special little secret. Between the three of us, we shared 4 desserts (there is always room for dessert!).. I'll start from fair to outstanding. First, was the Japanese coffee dessert which had the consistency of jello, and a strong coffee aroma that progressively developed. This was not quite my favorite but my friends thought it was fair/good. Then there was the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. Oh my was this delicious. All three of us loved the prominent but not overpowering black sesame in each spoonful of this dessert. It could have gone very badly, as in, an extremely bitter taste had too much black sesame been added, but this was perfectly made. The piece(s) de resistance were certainly the truffles. Without question, the green tea was the best. These tiny morsels were a paradoxical treat. Creamy and sumptuous, thick and flavorful, but surprisingly light. We had ordered a plate and loved it so much that our 4th dessert followed suit. The only exception, which was a mistake, was that we ordered the black sesame flavored truffles and they utterly paled in comparison to the glorious green tea. Here, the black sesame went a bit overboard and a bitter aftertaste resulted in an unkind dessert. They were spiked with sake but it just didn't seem to work. I tasted a vinegary truffle that did nothing for me but force me to rebuke the thought of ever ordering them again. The three of us agreed to stick to the green tea truffle for future reference. This place is cozy and I'd love to come back for more than just their dessert. The menu seemed extensive and friends have suggested some of their signature dishes.
Elizabeth L.}New York, NY}228}775}226}18}5}6/12/2010}The food here is delicious and authentic, and going downstairs in some nondescript building in Midtown East to find Sakagura feels extremely Japan-esque to me. I've only been for lunch, but the lunch deals here are fantastic. The other day I had the soba special, which consisted of cold or hot soba and a rice bowl of eel and cucumbers. The eel was the freshest I'd had outside of Japan--maybe they import?Anyway, very fresh and make a note to visit the bathroom when you visit - it's in a giant sake barrel!
Joanna L.}New York, NY}197}360}234}-1}5}6/8/2010}The food at Sakagura is pretty outstanding. Enter through an unassuming office-space type entrance, go downstairs and enter a beautifully decorated izakaya. Best plates? Kamo Roast (sliced duck), Agedashi Tofu, Buta Kakuni (stewed diced pork)Will definitely be back - especially to check out the sake menu as well!
Suzana U.}New York, NY}12}175}475}-1}5}6/8/2010}Great japanese restaurant (kinda tapas style with Japanese small portion). But just about everything is great, taste delicious , looks great and is just a great experience.I bring friends and family all the time here and everyone is always impress. If you want to try Japanese food with small portions and tastes delicious.. come to sakagura!
Lynn C.}NY, NY}90}141}3}-1}4}6/5/2010}Came here for a friend's birthday. The food was DELICIOUS!! Ordered the popular tuna tartar (which has an amazingly beautiful presentation) and black sesame cream brulee, and I have to agree with the Yelpers - they were YUMMY! Other than that, I also loved the grill octopus, agedashi tofu, and Sanma Onigiri, which is rice balls with shiitake mushroom, pickled radish and mountain vegetables wrapped with baked pike macherel. One of the best rice balls I've ever had!  Our waiter was nice and often checked up on us in a non-annoying way. He even let us sample the sake when my friend asked. Don't remember what kind it was, but I thought it was delicious considering I'm not a fan of sake. I took off one star because I'm just being picky. This place isn't the most economical way of eating out, but I would come back for special occasions.
Ron T.}Forest Hills, NY}180}262}32}-1}5}5/31/2010}Unlike most Izakaya's, Sakagura is a quiet low key romantic Sake Bar. The food is good. The Sake list is great. Going through the lobby of the building and going down to the basement is quite an experience. Don't be concerned though, the restaurant is very elegant and beautiful.
Marlene S.}Alexandria, VA}49}80}0}-1}5}5/31/2010}Sakagura was amazing! Food here is amazing and the dining experience is so much fun and unique. The staff here is also friendly and nice. Loved the atmosphere because you can wear shorts and still experience amazing, elegant food. The restaurant is located in the basement of an office building. So you have to walk into the office building, take the elevator to the basement and then the restaurant is right there.We ate here on Saturday night and I am still craving the food here. We had 2 of their specials for the day (the lightly seared toro with grated daikon radish and stone cooked filet mignon). We also got the Tori Tsukune (chicken meatballs), Jaga Dandgo (fried mashed potatoes), Gyu Miso Nikomi (shredded beef in miso), Black Sesame Cream Brulee, and the Mango Pudding. Every single dish we got was so delicious!We definitely come back here!!!
Mark S.}Fairfax, VA}186}697}77}-1}5}5/30/2010}Hidden gem. Food is absolutely amazing. Went on a Saturday night at 7pm. Called ahead to see the wait.. lady told us ten minutes. When we got there we were seated immediately. The place is extremely spacious. The wait staff is very friendly. They do not rush you and each group of diners had their own privacy. Decor and atmosphere are wonderful. Yrs it is a bit pricey, but high quality foods. So delicious. We ordered the seared tuna, fillet mignon, beef in miso sauce, deep fried mashed potatoes, chicken meatballs, black sesame cream brulee, and mango pudding (special). Everything was perfect. Bill was about $75 before tip. Shorts, jeans, etc are ok. Great casual elegant Japanese restaurant. No sushi! Oh lots of sake choices. Lychee sake looked good though. Definitely going back!
Jocy C.}San Diego, CA}1343}1249}4959}18}4}5/30/2010}What a neat place!  Thank you, Yelp friends.  I took a personal day on a Friday and met up with a few former colleagues for lunch.Location:Midtown East area.Sakagura is located in an office building.  Once you walk into the office building, walk past the Security Guard, and he'll direct you downstairs into the basement.Food:Awesome!I ordered the Kaisen Don (assorted sliced Sashimi on top of sushi rice with cold homemade soba noodles (can also get the soba noodles hot as well).  Both the sashimi & soba noodles were super fresh.For dessert, I ordered their famous Black Sesame Creme Brulee with Black Sesame Ice Cream.  It lives up to its hype.  If there is nothing else you get there, you MUST GET the Black Sesame Creme Brulee.  You will NOT regret it!Thanks for a fantastic experience.
Jennifer N.}Chicago, IL}305}1162}16}18}4}5/29/2010}I'll admit it - half of the appeal of Sakagura is the weird, almost secret location. I liked scurrying down some random stairs only to find a lovely basement restaurant.   Clearly the other half of the appeal is the sake (which I didn't sample, but my dinner companions did, and they were both impressed). Think tapas. Most of the menu is small dishes, ideal for sharing. I fell in love with the Jaga Dango (basically doubly friend potatoes). The tori tsukune (chicken meatballs) was less exciting.   The sake oyako don is delicious - fillets of salmon and roe served with rice and miso -  and tastes like amazing comfort food.  A bit less interesting (though very clean and fresh tasting) was the cold udon noodle - basically a plate of very plain noodles served with a bonito soy sauce that you pour on top of the noodles.  As is often the case with tapas, your desire to prevent hunger can make for a steep bill -- we ended up dropping $85 for three people -- which isn't that much, but it certainly wasn't the most cost-effective eating.  That said, scurrying down that flight of stairs made it all worthwhile.  This place is worth checking out for the novelty factor alone.
Jim U.}Washington, DC}669}1303}3042}-1}5}5/23/2010}Sakagura, along with Sushi Yasuda and Soba Totto, all located on the same block of east 43rd street, form a holy trinity for Japanese food enthusiasts.  I can think of no better place to be in the city than on this block.  Sakagura though, if not the best of the three, is the most interesting because many people are likely to miss it.  You have to enter a private building and go downstairs below street level to get to it.  As such, it tends to be a place frequented by those in the know, and among those, mostly Japanese.  Clearly exclusivity is auspicious in this case.I sat at the bar for lunch and was tempted by the rich selection of sake, and the sake flights they have available, but ultimately did not yield.  I can't drink at lunchtime.  The selection was impressive though.  I ordered the tsukune for the appetizer.  This consisted of 4 chicken meatballs drizzled with teriyaki sauce served over a bamboo leaf.  These were delicious with nicely balanced flavors.  Immediately after these were placed though, my main entree of the Kamo Namban arrived.  Even more delicious.  The soup came replete with generous rectangular cuts of tasty roasted pork, shiitake mushrooms, scallions, soba noodles, and a soy based broth.  The noodles were ideal possessing great taste and separating with ease.  The broth was lovely too.  The vegetable additions were a bit chewy to be functional though, but the dish was otherwise solid and worth slavering over.  For dessert I had their signature truffles which come in three different flavors.  The black sesame with shochu flavor was decent but too evocative of alcohol to really pass for candy.  The green tea flavor was excellent though.  Highly, highly recommend Sakagura for Japanese food along with the two neighboring restaurants.  Even when they are short of perfection, they are so much better than many other places.
sean m.}New York, NY}17}17}83}-1}4}5/23/2010}What is it about "hidden" underground spots that make them so appealing ? It's that allure of the surreptitious speakeasy , being an insider I suppose. The sake selection is unbelievable to the point of being daunting actually. Opt for the Saturday or Sunday special or ask for guidance ! This isn't a "Sushi" spot stick to the Japanese tapas although the sashimi special was well rounded and fresh save for torro which we thought frozen.The bar is the best seat in the house as it distracts you from the fact that you are in a 1960's office building basement. It can get expensive here don't get all sake goggles and blow your whole paycheck-warning !
Amanda K.}New York, NY}2}38}0}-1}5}5/19/2010}There isn't much more to add to all the rave reviews that are already posted for this place, but I loved it so much that I feel compelled to write a review.  We started with the more typical, common dishes like agedashi tofu and chawanmushi--now, I have tasted A LOT of these two dishes before at various Japanese restaurants.  But the ones here were just a step higher than all of the ones I have eaten before, even some of the best ones.  The tofu and the egg were so soft, and filled with so much rich flavor that only a  mother's hands can bring out- if you know what I mean.  They just seemed to be prepared with so much care and love.   Even something as simple as fried chicken was impeccably prepared- perfectly marinated and fried.  Tuna tartar-  a pleasure in both appearance and taste.   Each dish tasted exactly like how it ought to taste- no funky mix of curious flavors.   The desserts- the chocolate souffle and the black sesame creme brulee- were also heavenly.   I am so glad that I finally had a chance to try this place.  The place is so serene looking, tucked away in a basement away from all the hustle-bustle of the city.  The bill can add up, with all the dishes you order, but it is not outrageous.  Yes, there are some cheaper alternatives for Izakaya, but sometimes you just gotta pay for the warm fuzzy feeling you get from eating such pleasant food.
Jeanette L.}New York, NY}360}540}6}-1}5}5/18/2010}This is my bro's favorite Japanese place in NYC and I've gotten to try it twice. So delicious! Not sure I can remember everything I've ever gotten here but here are the highlights of deliciousness!!:JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp $6.00 -- best thing in the world. so delicious i can't even put into words...GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato ---- really good if you like beef tongue, I can't get over the texture (and what it is, hello!) but my parents/brother liked it-- for Mother's Day, we also got this Kobe beef thing that was a special, IT WAS AMAZING.ok, onto desserts. i love desserts so maybe i'm biased but my brother normally doesn't like desserts and he is OBSESSED:BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE  with Black Sesame Ice Cream $7.00 --- one of the most amazing things you'll ever eatCHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Sauce $7.00   with " DARUMA AGED SAKE " $14.00 -- yummy!this place is delicious and worth every penny (lots of pennies, be prepared, our bill each time has been pretty pricey)
Overeater S.}Palisades Park, NJ}15}37}0}-1}3}5/17/2010}OK, yea so my fiance and I after having dined at Sushi Yasuda were still a little hungry and wanted some more sake so we want across the street to Sakagura...big mistake... although the ambiance is nice and the menu seems rather extensive i did not find any of the food to be that delicious, although I guess it would be hard to top after having just had the best sushi of my life beforehand...the sake and service was good and the place seemed to be crowded with regulars so I think I'll have to try it out again..I've been to a few izakayas though and wasn't too overly impressed... i prefer aburiya kinnosuke over sakagura
Tessy M.}Astoria, Queens, NY}4}26}0}-1}4}5/16/2010}This is a hidden authentic Japanese IZAKAYA near grand central station. IZAKAYA is a Tapas place you mainly drink alcohol and eat small plates. It is expensive and portion is not big, but you can get excellent food. Service is always great.
gary b.}New York, NY}0}21}0}-1}4}5/3/2010}We enjoyed everything we ate here.  Only issue was trying to figure out how to get to the basement as the guard there was zero help.  I had never been to a true japanese restaurant before aside from those steakhouses out in the burbs.  This is more reminiscent of tapas where the portions are small and shared.  Our bill was a little high only because we splurged on the $50 sake, which was fabulous by the way!  The staff was VERY good, refilling our water multiple times.  We don't do japanese too often but if we do, we'll be back here again I'm sure.
Tan C.}New York, NY}9}43}0}-1}5}5/3/2010}5 stars. the food, the ambiance and the service is all superb. It just really added to the experience. The menu is extensive as it's "izakaya" type dining. The items ordered  were chopped salmon sashimi mixed with kim chee over rice, beef back ribs in a miso stew, soba, tuna sashimi with natto, filet mignon over hot stone, grilled duck with slice of scallion, fluke sashimi with salmon roe, seaweed salad and black sesame breme brulee. They were all excellent. The beef back ribs were super tender and really tasty esp served in in its' broth. I will definitely be back to try all the other items on the menu. What a jewel.
Ji Won S.}New York, NY}8}19}0}-1}5}4/25/2010}You have to know and appreciate authentic Japanese food to truly enjoy the food here.  Don't expect the "Americanized" sushi, terriyaki, etc.  The portions are smaller, but if you go with a larger group, you can try an array of dishes.  Drinks are overpriced and if you know that going in, you won't get sticker shock when you see the tab.    Keep in mind that the cheapest sake is $22 and there's no wine.  You may want to enjoy the impeccable food and have drinks somewhere after dinner.The dishes are clean, exquisite, and perfectly seasoned.  Sashimi was amazingly fresh and robust with flavor.  All of the dishes were unique and tasty.  The pork is amazing (with or without the yummy fat layer on top).
Rebekah L.}Chicago, IL}21}33}0}-1}5}4/20/2010}I went here last night with a large group of friends for their sake tasting and it was incredible. The decor is gorgeous and the waitstaff was very attentive, welcoming all of us simultaneously in Japanese. The sake tasting was very well organized and the variety and quality of the sakes offered was mindblowing! I didn't really have any sake I didn't like, and there was absolutely no limit to how much you could drink. Our large group ordered a bunch of food, and although it came out in the wrong order and was given to the wrong people (example: I ordered chicken and tofu and the salad with cod roe was given to me, and I am allergic to seafood) but we were having fun socializing and drinking and didn't care. The food tasted good and was well presented as you would expect at an upscale Japanese establishment. In my opinion, as someone who is allergic to seafood and cannot eat most Japanese dishes, the best items on the menu are their desserts. I had the Chocolate Sea Salt Sorbet, which is really more of a ice cream because it contains cream, and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. Both were mindblowing!! I can't wait to go back again.
Kiera H.}Collegeville, PA}26}44}9}-1}5}4/18/2010}We made reservations here with a party of 7 after not being able to get in last minute (i.e. three days beforehand) with any other sushi restaurants in the area for our planned trip to NYC. It was...not what we expected. But it was an amazing experience. I didn't read the fine print on the Yelp entry that clearly does not list Sakagura as a sushi bar, so my first thought when I opened the menu was "crud, where are the rolls?!" (hang my head as a shameful American!) But I'm glad that I opened my mind and went along with it. It reminded me of a tapas place-- you order many small dishes and share. So all 7 of us ordered one or two different things, and every one I tried was awesome. I ordered the sake oyako don (salmon sashimi over rice with salmon roe) which was droolworthy. And my husband just about exploded with glee when he saw that they carry Awamori. He's been craving to have it again since he visited Japan several years ago. It was $50, but considering it's ~25% apv, it's well worth the money compared to the price of other drinks in new york city.Just a suggestion for those trying to find the place, you have to enter the 211 E 43rd street lobby, follow the signs and go down an elevator to get there. My only criticism was that our waitress seemed like she wasn't used to dealing with customers that weren't familiar with the cuisine/customs and it came off a little snobby a few times, but not enough to impact our experience. Try this place! It's one of the places that makes me want to go re-review some of the other 5 star reviews I've written so when I do give them it means so much more.
karen t.}New York, NY}38}50}29}-1}1}4/13/2010}food was ok for the price.  cute place but nothing you can't get anywhere else.  What really bother me was the service.  We had reservation form 6pm they told us we have the table until 830pm which was plenty of time for us!  from they rushed us from course one.  we werent even finished with the first course the third course was already on the table!!?? after i told the waiter to hold our food he did it again with course 4,5 &6??!! that actually didnt bother me much its wat happens next: i realized i forgot to bring a cake i went to the cashier and asked her where i can get a birthday cake she told me grand central station. after came back with a cake she told me i cant cut my cake here because they have dessert and there a $20 charge for cuttin my own cake... u may argue how was the cashier suppose to know i wanted to cut my cake here.. well i'm sure a lot of people run out in the middle of their meal to buy a birthday so they can bring it home! ? i think they've been in the business long enough to acknowledge that
Kerry G.}Brooklyn, NY}0}3}0}-1}5}4/9/2010}SO amazing!We went here for my birthday and it was perfect! I loved that there was a coat check (in the winter this is a godsend!). Right away the staff was amazing and friendly. The Sake menu was vast and the staff gladly offered guidance. The food was WONDERFUL! Everything is ordered family-style. We all ordered something and picked and chose what we wanted. It was nice to be able to eat off of someone else's plate so to speak. Very good place to go with a group since the more people you have, the more food you can try (without stuffing your face!).Would go back in a heartbeat!
Mr Patel T.}New York, NY}11}57}5}-1}1}4/4/2010}This restaurant is horrible for a myriad of reasons but let me elaborate.1. They do not have any hot sauce no siracha, no pepper flakes, no chilly oil.2. They do not make any type of rolesMy friend and I ordered Edamame, Seaweed Salad, Miso Soup, Grilled Chicken Dish,and a Fried Tofu dish.Edamame was greatSeaweed salad had some gummy consistencyGrilled chicken dish had the skin and fat on the chicken breast which was inedible.The fried tofu was served in large marshmallow type cubes but when you sliced the cube the inside had a Bearnaise sauce type of consistency which is inedible.   The server refused to deviate from the menu. I asked if he could make tempura immediately he said no. Do not go to this restaurant period.
Miles H.}Taipei, Taiwan}51}169}0}-1}5}4/2/2010}As authentic as it gets. In a basement of some kind of office building in midtown manhattan, the owners of Sakagura have recreated Japan. This place is a recreation of a typical sake restaurant in Japan. Most people come from the sake, get hungry and order dishes to feed that hunger (I know I frequented one called Bom Bom across the street of my office in Tokyo).Anyway, the difference between this place and the places in Japan is that they focus on the food. There is a huge menu here, so it might be hard to decide. But here are some of my favorite dishes for your first visit:Daikon SaladAmadai Saiko YakiButa KukaniHiyayakkoGyu MIso Nikomi
Alexandra C.}New York, NY}844}1897}61}18}4}3/31/2010}Excellent quality, freshly prepared food in Midtown. My salmon dish was excellent. My date loved his dish too which at the moment I can't remember what it was. All the fish was very fresh.Service was good. Ambience very nice.Was there another time for lunch and had the BEST eel over rice dish ever.Summary: A MUST try in Midtown. Can't wait to go back!
Pinky And The B.}Manhattan, NY}852}1468}5797}-1}4}3/28/2010}This is basically Japanese tapas and they are known to have the largest sake collection in New York city. This is one of the few places that  I would take out of town guests to talk and eat. It is near Grand central and the  Grand Hyatt hotel. They do not rush you here. This place is a quiet oasis from the loudness of New York city. It has more of a Zen Ambiance. The quality, authenticity and variety are the highest.
Vladimir P.}San Francisco, CA}3}79}8}-1}5}3/22/2010}One of the best Japanese places I've been to in my entire life (I haven't been to Japan yet though). Here is what I ordered:KAMO ROASTGYUTAN YAWARAKA NISANMA ONIGIRICHOCOLATE SOUFFLEand several brads of plum sake names of which I no longer remember.Everything was perfect.
Sandra C.}New York, NY}25}58}0}-1}4}3/19/2010}Went here on a Sunday night as soon as it opened up for the evening. What a gem! Despite it's downstairs location, it has a great, authentic atmosphere. We had some sake and the Sesame Seed Creme Brulee with Sesame Seed Ice Cream and it was probably the best ice cream I have ever had. And that's saying a lot because one of my clients is an ice cream company and I've been flying around the world trying ice cream for them. I'm sure their sushi is wonderful too but I'm giving four stars because I didn't try it. Sorry!
Minhan S.}Queens, NY}90}363}537}-1}3}3/14/2010}I seriously did not expect this. I wanted to be one of those happy reviewers, but I have to be honest to my readers. So please don't be mad, people.It was a special birthday dinner. A friend of mine suggested "Ninja New York", but I chose this place. 4.5 star rating? $$$? everything was better than Ninja NY! Sushi bar and all Japanese food is there? No question should be asked! I told my friends, "This is close to perfect! Just follow me!"In 5 minutes after we opened the menu, I was blamed. "THERE IS NO SUSHI? Thanks, man! We wanted sushi!" I was surprised too because on Yelp one of the categories was "Sushi Bar."(it must be taken down!) "Alright, sorry guys, but let's try something they have here."- Correction: The category says "Sushi Bar", but I was told that it's actually "Sake Bar." Now it all makes sense!For appetizers, we ordered Tofu salad and crab meat something. Both were good according to my friends. So Appetizers - OK! For entree, we got Saikoro Steak - diced steak, Buta Kakuni - stewed diced pork, Chawanmushi - egg custard with chicken, shrimp and gingko nuts, and Sanshoku Nasu Dengaku - grilled Japanese eggplants served with three kinds of miso. All my friends liked the food they ordered, but I have to talk about some complaints.1. Portion was small. 2. Nothing comes with rice. When we got our food, we were waiting for rice to be served, and waited for a while. I finally asked one of the waiters, and the answer was "NO!" I couldn't believe that this Asian food doesn't come with rice. (Maybe I am cheap so I eat something coming with rice all the time.) Especially Buta Kakuni had very think stew, and I loved it. But it would be better with rice. And without rice the portion was too small.Oh here are some more complaints.3. Food serving takes forever. We got two steak first, and after about 10 minutes we got the rest of the food one by one. At the moment we started eating, the steak was cold. :-/4. Sake? The bottles are not the small ones!! (and more expensive than what you think if you are not a huge fan of sake!)These are not usual sake you order at any Japanese restaurant. It doesn't come in the small cute bottle here. They actually have big wine-bottle size Sake bottles. And it costs about $100. Of course you can order glass, but it's still overpriced for normal people like me. :( I like the variety of sake there, but waiters weren't able to suggest any to us. :(I gotta wrap this up.I loved their food! REALLY! OMG, the pork stew? it itself gets this restaurant 5 stars! It's just because of the reasons I listed above.Tip:This place is good for a date. Food takes long time to be served, so you earn time to talk. Music is not loud, so you don't have to scream. Even though it gets crowded, there is enough space between tables, so you won't feel uncomfortable. so.. Good luck! :)
Christina C.}New York, NY}8}188}157}-1}3}3/12/2010}Sakagura is in a basement but the decor and the nice setting of the restaurant are good enough to make you forget that you are actually in a basement.  It is considered quite a large space with many seating.  Overall I would say that the setting and ambience of this place far exceed the price and tastiness of the food itself.It is a good place to have a meal with your colleagues or friends BUT if you are really seeking out for real, quality Jap food, this place is considered AVERAGE.  But it is still a nice place and I will come back for the overall package.
DH H.}New York, NY}90}895}2}-1}4}3/11/2010}Sakagura turned me away a few years ago, when we all showed up in shorts and t-shirts.  Perhaps something was lost in translation, because this time the place certainly seemed casual enough.Fast forward to an evening with a bunch of Japanese people, and we had a great time.  Ordered one bottle of sake and got another one on the house.  All sorts of random japanese dishes that I didn't understand that weren't on the english menu.  Thank god for japanese speakers.Atmosphere is great.  Love this place.  It's in a pointless neighborhood, which means the opportunities to go here are fairly minimal, but it's possibly even worth a ride on the green line..
Hannah C.}Fort Lee, NJ}648}480}56}-1}4}3/10/2010}i really didn't expect this place to be good at all. it's in the basement of an office building, all the way in the east 40's -- a neighborhood i rarely go to to hang out. when my friend and i got there, it was completely packed.  and even though he had made reservations, we still had to wait for a little bit. i was super annoyed by that time, but the night turned out to be a pleasant tasting experience.i was really surprised when their food and sake came out. all their plates were pretty amazing and there wasn't a dish that i did not like. and the funny thing is, i never liked sake until tonight. no joke. and i realized that i probably drank the wrong type of sake my entire life -- the dry kind or the heavy milky kind. the great thing about this place was the servers were very knowledgeable in the assortment of sake's and food, and they were also very (very) patient and nice with inexperienced sake drinkers like us. our server let us taste three different kinds before getting a bottle. i don't know the name of the sake we drank tonight, but if you ask the server for a "very easy to drink sake," they will probably all recommend the same one. if you're ever in the area, and even if you aren't, i really recommend you checking out this place. it's totally worth the hassle.
Dustin K.}Queens, NY}28}252}3}-1}3}3/10/2010}I was thinking about 4-Stars for this review, but I didn't want to be swayed by other great reviews and ignore the reality of the situation --- Sakagura is a fun place with quality food, but its nothing to write home about (but ok to write yelp about).The atmosphere is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. I've never been to Japan, but I assume it has to be something like Sakagura --- therefore maybe I should consider giving them 4-Stars for saving me on the expensive airfare. Service was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.We got a few bottles of sake, and I thought they were on the expensive side, but after looking them up online they seemed to be about 120% markup which is probably typical for NYC (if not on the lower side). FOOD, I'll try to break it down by what I remember we had (although I don't know the Japanese names):- Edamame - soggy and pretty tasteless- Scallops with egg yolk - interesting different taste, wierd consistency, little heavy on the sauce- Tuna Tartar - very good, two different types of roe on top- grilled squid - pretty plain, same as anywhere else- Eggplant w/ 3 diff sauces (miso, spinach, and egg yolk) - one of my favorite dishes and I am not even an eggplant fan- dumplings - eh had much better, pretty boring tasting- chicken meatballs - tasted like the dumplings with better consistency- steak cooked on rock - one of the better dishes, great panzu? sauceThey served a complimentary green tea at the end of dinner which was very tasty.Overall, I think it was a good dining experience, but I was not blown away by the food. For the overall price, I probably won't go back again unless someone else really wanted to go there --- I am not opposed to it.
Melissa and Hiro S.}New York, NY}0}27}0}-1}4}3/10/2010}This is a great place to come with a group of friends. Order a few bottles of GIkyo or Wakatake sake, some dishes and watch the evening unfold. The food is good, but the real reason to come here is for the sake and for the uniquely authentic Japanese atmosphere. I feel transported back to my Tokyo days, as soon I start walking down to the Basement, where this restaurant is located. Servers are attentive without over-selling or acting overbearing. It doesn't merit five stars for two specific reasons: Portions are small and....at the end of the day, the restaurant is in the Basement of a Midtown office building. However, grab a few friends you have not seen in a while and prepare to linger...it will be a good night, but dont forget the sake!
Meredith M.}New York, NY}1}79}0}-1}4}3/9/2010}Last weekend I came here for a friend's birthday.  After having a hard time finding the place (it's in an office building's basement..weird) we were pleasanty surprised.  It's small but nice.  We were told there was sushi but low and behold it's a traditional Japanese restaurant.  All food is served appetizer style (small portions) because everyone is meant to share.  I ordered kaisen kim-chee don.  I've always been skeptical at ordering sashimi but omg it was out of this world.   Other people had the saikoro steak, tori karaage (fried chicken), uba shumai (pork dumplings), surumeika yaki (grilled squid and oh so good), gindara yuan yaki (cod), and gyu miso nikomi (ribs).  After all that sharing, we were given green tea.  The tea was a little strong.  Next came dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream which like the tea was too strong.  The chocolate souffle was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. My friend got the black sesame cream brulee.  It wasn't too bad if you can get over the sesame.
Lisa F.}Fresh Meadows, NY}162}271}243}-1}4}3/5/2010}After a recent trip to Japan I had a serious hankering for some authentic Japanese cuisine and found this place through yelp. Went for a lunch date with my husband today. Upon arriving I felt like I had been transported back to Japan. It was pretty crowded for lunch so I recommend making reservations. We ordered the Sashimi Gozen and Jewel Oke Bento. Sashimi was delicate and fresh. The best part of the meal was definitely the black sesame creme brulee. It comes with a scoop of homemade black sesame ice cream and a black sesame praline crisp on top. We licked our spoons clean.
Jan Y.}Long Island City, NY}97}374}1307}-1}4}2/24/2010}I love that this place is hidden and tucked away, it's like a little  secret that I want to keep all to myself...of course now this place is super popular erf~~So much Sake and sooo little time! So I've always heard that the Italians pair great wines to compliment their food however the japanese  pair great foods to compliment their Sake.  This is the place that demonstrates that exact saying.  A big menu of small dishes to compliment your oh so yummy sake! a perfect place to come with a few friends and chat the night away...
Sara D.}Brooklyn, NY}23}14}0}-1}4}2/22/2010}This place is fantastic...  a hidden gem in the heart of midtown. They have a wide variety of noodle dishes, which are super tasty.They have an even wider variety of sake. But the best item on their menu is definitely their chocolate cake!! Best I have ever eaten in my life!!I cannot give them the fifth star though, because of the lack of gluten free items in their menu (wish they would offer some more sushi...)
Miranda S.}Brooklyn, NY}39}134}0}-1}5}2/20/2010}Last week my husband and I had one of the best meals we've enjoyed in some time. The food was sublime, the service impeccable and gracious, the atmosphere tranquil and romantic.So, where is this lost paradise, this culinary katmandu, you ask? Answer: in the basement of an apartment building in the lonely canyons beyond Grand Central Station.Seriously? Seriously.Sakagura is indeed tucked away in an unlikely venue, but when you make the final turn around the staircase, you enter another world. It's like finding a secret doorway to a magical land.Sakagua is basically a Japanese tapas & sake house. Don't go here expecting sushi, because they don't serve it. Instead, you will find an extensive, authentic menu of Japanese small plates, all of which can be happily enjoyed with a selection from their incredible sake menu, or with a lovely cold beer.We tried a good handful of dishes, though I wish we'd had time to try even more (we had to rush off to the ballet). Favorites included:Hirame Ponzu, or Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Topped with Grated Dikon Radish Dressed with a Citrus Vinaigrette. The sashimi was so, so, so good. I could have eaten plate after plate of this fresh, delightful dish.For hot dishes, we loved the house special Buta Kakune, or Tender Pork Belly simmered in a sweet, salty, savory addictive sauce. This is one of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had. The entire portion of meat was incredibly tender and the sauce coated and clung to the whole fatty, glistening mess in a way that begged you to just pick up the delicate little bowl and pour it straight into your mouth.The Gyu Miso Nikomi, or Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish were also a big hit at our table. The meat, again, was really tender and the sauce, while savory, had some indefinable element of sweetness that was completely seductive.Other delightful bites included:Ijura Oroshi, or Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe. The radish was like a pillow, or a cloud perhaps, on top of which glistening orange roe were perched. A little soy sauce added just the right amount of flavor to this subtle, silky dish.The steak grilled on a hot stone was more fun than it was outstanding, but the beef was of extremely high quality and the novelty of cooking it on the hot stone gave the meal a playful element.Desserts at Sakagura are also excellent - we shared the Black Sesame Creme Brulee, which was creamy and not too sweet. Very, very good.Best of all, the service at Sakagura is top-notch. I was extremely impressed with their attentiveness, timing, and generally friendly attitude. It made me realize how often service at many NYC restaurants is lacking, or lackluster.In sum, we honestly can't wait for an opportunity to go back.
John B.}Philadelphia, PA}82}192}68}-1}4}2/13/2010}4 stars with reservation.Let me get the non-food stuff out of the way. The waiter didn't even know what was in the seasonal sashimi special. Also when I asked him what was good, he had very hard time recommending the dishes. He seemed new so I let it slide. (plus he was so nice).We had 9 dishes among three people (they recommended 3 per person). We were stuffed by 7th.Must-have:-BUTA KAKUNI : SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork (Belly)...simply the best dish in the restaurant...got one per person.-Seasonal Duck Special: Roasted duck, sliced, served with sea salt-IKURA OROSHI : Grated Daikon Radish Topped with Fresh Salmon Roe (very non-fishy salmon roe...simple and good)GYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish (very subtly sweet, it's delicious)Good-TORI TSUKUNE : Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce-(with reservation) MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar. We got it because people on Yelp were raving about it. It was fresh and wasn't overly dressed (but I'm so sick of tuna tartar).Could have done without-Seasonal special sprouts with miso: I felt like I was eating miso straight up. Way too salty. If it came with a bowl of rice, I would have enjoyed it more-Seasonal special steamed octopus in consume. Too bland. we got it 2nd to last...we were too stuffed to enjoy it.-Seasonal special rice porridge with oysters (all chopped and cooked). We got it as last...we were too stuffed to enjoy it. But i prefer Cantonese rice porridges better. This one was way too watery.Overall, there were some amazing dishes and some not-so-much. If you order the good ones you can have an amazing meal. Also definitely do not order 3 dishes per person (try something like 7 dishes for 3 people and get some dessert).
Jennifer H.}New York, NY}74}335}30}-1}5}2/12/2010}If at first you don't succeed, try try again. After a failed attempt to walk-in at Sakagura a friend and I nabbed a Friday night res at their bar seats. Through a seemingly anonymous building lobby, past a dozing security guard, down some industrial stairs to the basement level you'll find fresh, inventive, and thoroughly delicious dining. The sashimi cuts were thick and tasty. Yellowtail, toro, and salmon. The seaweed salad includes 4 seaweeds and sesame dressing. I recommend it all! Agedashi tofu, fluke carpaccio with plum sauce, and pork and shrimp dumplings in thin beancurd wrapper. If there is such a thing as Japanese tapas, this is it.Another surprise, the bill was only $35 each. A bargain at twice the price.
Jim G.}Bronx, NY}28}186}120}-1}4}2/7/2010}This is a great place! If you are looking for something unique and like to drink sake Sakagura should be at the top of your list. The food is good and they have an extensive menu but it is the sake list that is most impressive. We had a great time with six people for under $190, and yes we topped off the night spliting four desserts that were awesome. I'm a sucker for green tea ice cream.
Stephen W.}Washington, DC}15}26}0}-1}5}2/3/2010}Sakagura is spectacular.  Many of the reviews mention you feel like you are stepping into a slice of Tokyo when you walk down the basement stairs of the office building to the restaurant, and they are certainly spot on.  There are sake barrels decorating the space as well as large empty sake bottles, of which they have one of the largest selections in the country I've heard.  We tried four different kinds ourselves, and they were all excellent.  If you are new to sake like we are, definitely ask for suggestions.  The service in this respect was excellent.  Our server took more time than most would have seeing what kinds of wines we liked and then bringing us sake she thought would match our tastes.  She never once missed that's for sure.  The masu size was perfect if you find one you like as you get 2 good size square cups for you and your date to sip from.  The food... oh the food.  The best that we had was by far Sakagura's Special (BUTA KAKUNI), which was stewed diced pork.  Get one per person and you will be very happy.  Since the dishes are mostly relatively small, tapas-sized, plates, we ordered a handful of items.  Next was the FLUKE CARPACCIO, which was Fluke Sashimi drizzled with olive oil a plum paste and salmon roe.  The sashimi was very tender and the roe added a nice flavor, but it wasn't my favorite, mostly b/c I am just not a huge roe/sashimi fan.  My gf seemed to enjoy this a lot, so you might as well.  Then we got the TORI TSUKUNE (4 Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce), which I thought were very good, but not quite great.  The YUBA SHUMAI (4 Minced Pork Dumplings with Shrimp and Lotus Roots) was not very flavorful, and was our least favorite dish.  Since each dish is relatively small, we ordered one more item - SAIKORO STEAK (Diced Steak Sauteed with Olive Oil Flavored with Grated Onion and Soy Sauce).  The chopped pieces of steak were very flavorful, and quite tender, and the sauce was delish.  Since we had heard their homemade deserts were to die for, we couldn't resist.  We were not let down.  The deserts alone earned this place 5 stars in my book.  Get the Chocolate Souffle and the Black Sesame Creme Brulee to share.  You know that feeling when you taste exactly what you were hoping for, and you just can't help a smile coming over your mouth, well that's what these were like.  You will not be disappointed.
Brittany H.}Santa Monica, CA}1037}631}254}18}4}1/31/2010}Traditional elegance, and "hotness", literally.  Located in the basement of a desolate building, the place was like a sauna walking in.  I walked a block or so, before realizing I had passed the place.  It's kind of a little hidden treasure.  Remarkable for sure.  Onto the food!!  I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi, but more izakaya or tapas style, not really traditional izakaya, but authentic nonetheless.  Did I confuse you already?  Whether in small groups or big, this place is a must for ordering a few different dishes and sharing them.  Hot, cold, raw, cooked dishes... there is a great variety to choose from.From what I can remember, we got the fluke sashimi, tofu salad, uzaku "eel", tuna tartare (atop with caviar), grilled japanese eggplant and onigiri and buta kakuni.  My least favorite was the onigiri, it was uninspiring and straight up boring.  Highlights were the fluke sashimi, eggplant (eggyork being the best flavored sauce, sweet red being my least) and tuna tartare and their black sesame creme brulee is absolutely amazing.  (Partial to this, because frankly, anything black sesame is pretty amazing)They have an overwhelming listing of sake as well.  I mean, it was pretty unbearable.  We had our waiter pick out 3 different types of suggestion, the next carafe better than the previous.  Overall, this place is nearly flawless.  The onigiri ruined it...and though I loved the tuna tartare, I think the caviar could have been fresher (hence tasted better than what I sampled).  I've had a million versions of tuna tartare in my days (yeah I'm that old) and this definitely was not my favorite.  Still, I "love" this place and I will be back for sure.
Fumista O.}Brooklyn, NY}9}37}20}-1}5}1/30/2010}All i can say is very yum. and there are so many SAKE. If you are Japanese Sake fan, you should go. All foods are fancy and super good.You can have REAL japanese food.
Charlie L.}Seattle, WA}134}695}97}18}4}1/29/2010}Not sure I can add much to the hundreds of yelp on Sakagura. All I can say is yum... and that I've had my share of soy based pudding as a kid, but the Tonyu Pudding is the best I've ever had. To die for. Also highly recommend the Zuke. Fantastic fish, fantastic flavor combination and fantastic value. Kake Soba is okay, and the homemade ginger ale is a little overwhelming, but overall great food. My only complaint - they had last call for food, and my yakatori order was placed about 5 minutes before that point, and 10 minutes later they told me they had already broken down the grill. I left hungry. Not cool. But dispite that, I would go back.
Matt L.}Washington, DC}43}141}0}-1}3}1/27/2010}After my soup at Arirang, I figured I needed to go to yet another "hidden" restaurant.  This one had over 250 Yelp reviews, so I knew I wasn't discovering anything, but it's in a basement! That has to count for something!Maybe I ordered wrong -- I went with the Tsukune, a salmon onigiri, and the Maguro Tororo.  The Tsukune was tasty although a little fatty and overwhelmed by the teriyake sauce. I've had the same dish at Aburiya Kinnosuke, and their version is far superior IMHO, coming right out of the robata.  The salmon onigiri was fine.  Not fantastic, very edible, and not expensive.   A little too much rice for my taste, and the salmon was a little dry (again, I could favorably replicate this at oms-b).  The soba in the Maguro dish was quite good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  On a whole, the dish was good, fresh, and well flavored, but no better than anything else I've had.  The decor is very cool and the service is good, so this was on the whole a positive experience, but I just wasn't blown away.
Catherine S.}Atlanta, GA}113}197}1222}-1}4}1/25/2010}Feels like you are going to a speak-easy japanese restaurant!Food was fantastic and very varied in flavor.  Service was fantastic.  Food came out in a sensible order.  Cold things first, then at a perfect pace, the hot plates, followed by the starches and  then finally dessert was offered but not forced upon us.  I really do appreciate a well-timed meal!Cold Highlights were the housemade tofu salad and daikon salad with spicy cod roe dressing - chef's specialty sushi platter was a great deal - 15 slices for $45!Hot Highlights:  Agadashi tofu in a savory broth and grilled eggplant with 3 types of miso sauce.Starch:  Soba noodles (cold with dipping sauce and wasabi and scallion) and rice balls (salmon roe and cod roe).  The rice was perfectly textured.  Not too moist, and not too dry.Dessert:  The sesame creme brulee was amazing as was the earl tea ice cream with poached pear.Everything was beautifully presented and the final bill for three people was about $60 each with tax and tip.  Wonderful meal at a great value.
RM S.}Watertown, MA}0}34}0}-1}5}1/25/2010}Hands down the best place to go in NYC!  I stop by here every time I visit NYC.  I love the ambiance, service, and the high quality of their food.  They have so many sake choices that I was more than happy when the wait staff offered to recommend a few options.  Be ready to drop some $$$ when you come here, but you will not regret it!  They also have a great lunch menu that is a lot cheaper than their dinner.  Their soba is made in-house and you can really taste the difference.  I love the cold soba.
Ryan F.}Brooklyn, NY}97}13}0}-1}5}1/23/2010}Absolutely awesome experience.  Super appetizers and the best sake selection in NYC.  I will be back.
matthew h.}New York, NY}206}207}3}-1}4}1/23/2010}i have been meaning to go here for quite a while (since our soba discussion on yelp in '08) and i finally made it - but  didn't have soba.the space: entering the building it looks very much like you've picked the wrong place. but go down the industrial gray staircase and you arrive in a comfortable space, nicely lit w/out being overly bright - full but not overloud. the menu is arranged by increasing dish size - 1st all the cold then all the warm dishesignoring the ridiculously expensive bottle of sake we had (there are more reasonable options i assure you - but then there were WAY costlier ones too) the prices were really not bad, given the amount of food we ate. everything was plated beautifully. between 2 of us we had (in no particular order):FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf this was one of my top 3 tastes of the night - the sour saltiness of the umeboshe paste set the fish off perfectly, and the salmon roe seemed to be lightly marinated in some soy concoction and the olive oil, adding a bass note of richness to their bright popJAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crispthese were like potato zeppole with a dish of salt on the side. fried mashed potatoes people - are you hearing me? delicious as is, but adding the salt lifted them to a level beyond.....SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU : Grilled Japanese Eggplants Served with Three Kinds of Miso ( Eggyork {sic}, Spinach,and Sweet Red )these were ok - well prepped, but all the misos were a bit too sweet, so each was its own monotone flavor. not bad, but not memorableGYU MISO NIKOMI : Shredded Beef Back Ribs Stewed in Miso Topped with Grated Dikon Radish mm mm mmmm mmm mmmmmm. another fabulous one from my top 3 - long stewed falling apart bits of meaty goodness with miso adding real rounded depth of flavor. a freakin umami bomb. YUBA SHUMAI : Minced Pork Dumpling with Shrimp and Lotus Roots Wrapped in a Thinly Bean Curd Sheet Served with " Ponzu " Japanese Citrus Saucereally good - nothing ridiculously innovative, but in a world where stuff wrapped in stuff tastes good, this stuff tasted really good. the ponzu cut the richness of the pork/shrimp really nicely. the yuba bean curd wrapping was a nice touch over the usual wonton wrapper.also 2 dishes off the specials of the day (so i cannot cut and paste the descriptions)Simmered Octopus with grated mountain yam and wasabi in a light citrusy broth of some sort.very tender - big chunks of octopus, and REAL wasabi, which i think is found in about 1% of restaurants in NYC. A real nose clearing kick.grilled duck and scallions - i think the sauce was a sweetened ponzu but i may not be remembering exactly.really really enjoyable. rich and comforting, even if the braised scallions tended to squirt their middles out if you tried to bite them. 3rd of my top 3.for dessert we had:CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with vanilla Ice Cream & Raspberry Saucethe souffle was good. a very standard dessert, but executed correctly - cakey on the outside, creamy on the in, and a rich chocolate taste that had me putting the raspberry sauce on the ice cream only, because i didn't want to adulterate the souffle flavor.BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Creamall the components of this were tasty, though i think the ice cream overrode the delicacy of the creme, which was a shame. nice piece of sesame brittle on top.there is a lot more menu to explore here, and i think i could spend my time in many worse ways than doing so.The sake was amazing - crisp, dry, super-premium (over 50% grind on the rice) and cost more than the rest of the meal combined. I'm trying hard to remember the name, so i can purchase it for my house (started w/ a k, came in a bluish squared off bottle - if you know drop me a note)so - do you want to go here? yes. yes you do.
Rachel K.}Queens, NY}152}248}13}-1}5}1/13/2010}I've been to Sakagura 3 times now and every time has been an amazing food experience.  I'm not Japanese nor will I pretend to know what authentic Japanese food tastes like, but I do know that Sakagura has never disappointed me.The atmosphere in this restaurant is definitely not what I expected the first time I walked in.  It's a huge space with high ceilings and giant barrels (which are actually the bathrooms).  The tables are nicely spaced apart which I think is hard to come by in NY when sometimes you feel like you're having dinner with the table beside you.  Reservations are recommended as this place has gotten to be quite popular and busy, but if you go on a week night, the wait may not be too long.The service is friendly and smiley.  They're also pretty informed about the sake menu in case you aren't.  The menu is huge and there are tons of choices.  The list of specials on the front page are always good choices.  Other good choices include the soft boiled egg and uni cold soup, grilled octopus, salmon sashimi bowl, grilled beef on stones and the cold tofu.  There are so many options to explore that you can really get whatever you're in the mood for at this upscale sake bar.I'd put this in my top 5 places in NYC.  Love it and will continue coming here.
Lorrie M.}San Jose, CA}3818}2992}262}18}4}1/5/2010}This is a unique restaurant which gave me an unexpected taste of Japanese cuisine here in New York. I don't think even after reading the reviews and getting the recommendations AND seeing the menu I was really prepared for what I was about to encounter. First, their lunch menu is VERY reasonably priced, especially their daily special soba set at $11.50 for a limited amount of sets ... but even so most of their food is very reasonably priced and they give you a lot of food as opposed to most of Manhattan where you end up paying a lot for a little.I can't lie, I was totally expecting ... sushi perhaps? but the sashimi pieces that came with my meal and even on the donburi bowl were tiny TINY pieces. Yes this was the Manhattan sized meal I was expecting ... but only for the sashimi. The sashimi was nevertheless good but I was disappointed to find that basically there was not even much nigiri or any other type sushi menu .... however, their soba ... wow. I was never even a fan of soba, I got their tasting course for lunch and the steak ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. hello, unexpected, undecorated slab of juicy tender beef ... little did I know.But overall, I have to say this was probably one of the best Japanese food experiences I've had simply because it was *so* different and quite amazing at that. The whole meal after all the combo and tasting courses came out to be around $50 for two. Lets try to find THAT in NYC ... good luck! I highly recommend their hot and cold soba sets, highly recommend their tasting menu and their beef is amazing. Sashimi not so much ... great place for lunch in the city!
Daichi K.}River Edge, NJ}10}57}37}-1}3}1/3/2010}Went to Sakagura after reading the all of the raves and the hype on yelp, the internet, and the local "Japion" newspapers in NYC and here is what I took away from Sakagura. Please, take this review with a grain of salt. The restaurant had an intimate setting. Very calm atmosphere with the dimmed lights and semi-quiet crowd. As you walk in, you will encounter a long line of sakes (over 225 bottles they claim) that just takes your breath away.  "Where do I even start??" was my first question after seeing the sake menu.Their sake list was, I must say, very intimidating. If you don't really know sake and you walk in to the restaurant, expect some surprises. They list their sake's by location (of where it was made) in Japan and by their grades (Junmai, Junmai Ginjo, Junmai Daiginjo and so on). I, not being a sake-fanatic, was puzzled by all of the different regions. The sakes can range from $6~$100 a glass so choose wisely.The food was honestly is not worth the price I have paid for. Flavor was great, but am not quite sure if the price that was paid was really worth it. My friend and I walked out of Sakagura spending $180 (with tip) to try 3 sake's each and some small side dishes. I do not understand the hype or the rave that people say the place is. The sake is great but their food is not something I would recommend here. I would come here for the sake. I would advise eating else where and then come in to Sakagura to have a small snack while enjoying the sake's on the list. Now come to think of it, when Anthony Bourdain did his episode in NYC. He did visit Izakaya Hagi with his guests before hitting up Sakagura. Maybe that should've been a hint?
Jordan H.}Wood-Ridge, NJ}5}27}1}-1}5}1/2/2010}Sakagura has the best selection of Sake in Manhattan as well as a very unique selection of food.  The atmosphere is unlike anywhere you will find anywhere else.  If you want a great selection of sake as well as excellent traditional Japanese cuisine, Sakagura is the ultimate location in New York.
dice-K S.}Brooklyn, NY}28}131}4}-1}4}12/29/2009}If you want sake, and some snacking food this is the place to go.  Extensive Sake menu, that might work well with an after work with co-workers senario. A bit loud and noisy but creates a nice atmosphere, similar to drinking restaurants in japan.The price is reasonable. Also recommend for a casual night out with friends
Laurie K.}New York, NY}2}17}0}-1}4}12/28/2009}my favorite japanese restaurant in the city -- and the best one i've been to so far.  after living here for 3 years and being disappointed by most japanese places (i am japanese myself), sakagura was a real find.  that its hidden in the basement of an office building, makes it even more of a treasure -- quiet, intimate atmosphere and it feels really japanese.  i ordered the ten don set, which was great. my mom had the soba salad, which was amazing. we also shared the seaweed salad.  and i had a ume musubi on the side.  it was my second time there and it didn't disappoint. the bathroom also has a japanese style toilet which was so fun!
nora c.}Manhattan, NY}8}54}0}-1}4}12/24/2009}the sake selection is pretty daunting and the waitress offered a description of each that was still confusing.  its located in the basement of an office building so you feel like youve discovered something special even though the whole world probably knows about this place.  the food is pretty good and creative.  i remember cooking wagyu beef on a sizzling stone with butter, and some deliciopus morsels of chicken and root vegetables.  delicious.  would definitely come back!
Phil L.}San Mateo, CA}264}75}0}-1}4}12/18/2009}So I came here with a friend to explore the world of Japanese dishes (outside of teriyaki, sushi, and tempura).  We ordered a total of 6 dishes: a duck dish, a cod dish, an unagi dish, agedashi tofu, pork belly dish, and tuna sashimi dish.  The duck was awesome, the cod was delish, and the unagi atop a salad was also wonderful.  The tofu was average, and the tuna sashimi one was with Mountain Yam, which the waiter immediately warned us was "slimy."  My friend and I just assumed mushier yams and then found out what someone had already Yelped...it was more like cottage cheese than it was yam.  Not all that enjoyable, but not terrible either.  5 outta 6 dishes in, I spoke with my friend.S: Hey, are you still hungry?Me: Yup.  Are you?S: Yeah.Clearly, the pork belly would not be enough.  Fortunately for us and for fellow hungry Yelpers, I quickly found the solution.2 Bowls of steamed white rice.  Coupled with the Pork Bellies, this filled us up and saved the day.
avalon e.}Sunnyvale, CA}22}228}18}-1}4}12/17/2009}Upon entry I realized its one of the joints mentioned by Bourdain.  Sashimi is pricey $48 for 5 kinds 3 pc each but fresh enough so I guess factoring in the NYC price premium it's ok.  Sanma (cooked) onigiri was way too challenging for my stomach and olfactories.  I kept burping sanma all night.  Other stuff like gyutan and seaweed salad are, well, good but pretty much like Tanto or Gochi of the Bay Area.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.
Carol S.}Marina del Rey, CA}5000}761}15}18}3}12/16/2009}I wasn't too pleased.  We had tuna with mountain yam which looked like creamy, white spit.   The soba noodles were mediocre, but the short ribs were good.  My friend recommended the pork belly, which I didn't order because it wasn't listed on the menu!Kickin myself in the ass.
sarit r.}Brooklyn, NY}1}2}0}-1}5}12/16/2009}best Japanese sake bar in the city. great food and amazing sake collection. one of my favorite spots.
Anhe N.}Brooklyn, NY}99}28}0}-1}4}12/15/2009}I have to divulge I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to Japanese food, only because I lived in Tokyo and the food there is so fresh and tasty (and affordable!) that few options here, even in nyc, compares. How delighted I was to find Sakagura! Hidden in the basement of what isn't even a very pretty office building, it feels like a beautiful, hidden gem. It's hands down the most extensive selection of sake I've found in the city so far, and eating in it's dimly lit, hush hush environment reminds me of the small, intimate restaurants in Tokyo. Their food is decent but not cheap (or I would've given it 5 stars). After the first meal, I only go there now for appetizers (I LOVE their chicken kagiage), sake, and some quiet conversation. And for their bathrooms. Even those are adorable. It's THAT kind of restaurant. You're almost guaranteed a great night of feeling pampered just the right amount :).
Diana L.}San Francisco, CA}3}36}0}-1}3}12/13/2009}(this review is only for lunch)i was taken to this place for a business lunch on a recent wednesday noon. it seems really popular as the place was packed. but luckily my colleagues made reservations. firstly, i would not have known about this place had my colleagues not picked this place. it's located in some office building(?) in the basement. but once you enter, the decor is very japanese. we settled down at our table and began to purvey the menu. we decided on a sashimi appetizer to share and each got a main dish. i got the tempura gozen, my colleagues each got the kamo namban and sake don. the food was fresh, well made, delicious and served pretty quickly. the service overall was attentive. the price is definitely on the higher end. but i wasn't paying so didn't care. we didn't have any sake since it was a work lunch. for that location/area, the price is probably comparable. if i want to try to sake i'll probably go back. but there are so many good japanese restaurants and sake bars that i am not sure if i'll trek up to mid town just to eat/drink here again. of course, i would if someone treats =)
P J.}San Francisco, CA}327}260}119}-1}5}12/7/2009}I haven't tried every sake bar in the city, but I'm willing to agree with the reviewers who say that Sakagura is the best.   We were lucky to find ourselves in the hands of "sake sommelier", Momo, and if you're looking for a sake experience as well as a great Japanese dinner, I would go when she's working on Tuesday or Thursday night.  Sakagura is a sister to Decibel in the East Village, but with a wider range of offerings from $6 glass to over $100 a glass.They serve a selection of sashimi, but Sakagura is a Japanese restaurant, not a sushi restaurant.  We ordered the sashimi tasting which was amazing.  Other favorites were the smoked duck, served cold with scallions, the pork belly, the miso cod and the black sesame creme brulee.Sakagura is next door to a sushi restaurant which can be confusing.  Go past the sushi restaurant into what looks like an office building, head left past the security guard and down the stairs into the basement.  "Basement" has negative connotations, but it actually adds to the the ambiance and the feel of stepping out of NYC and into Tokyo.  It's a little tricky to find, but well worth the search.
Karim Q.}Washington, DC}46}169}0}-1}4}12/4/2009}For a non-Japanese person, I consume far too much miso soup.  None has ever been as good as what Sakagura serves.  My palate was unexpectedly surprised to even have some, since the salmon and rice I had were delicious all on their own.  Yes, the salmon was so fresh I thought it may still be alive.  Rice is unfortunately underappreciated nowadays, by chefs and consumers both.  At Sakagura, it is not -- no, it has great texture and consistency.  I went for lunch so I missed out on the sake.  Yea, you ask who comes to a sake joint and doesn't drink?  Me, my coworker, and about 500 other people.  It was busy and loud but you're not coming here for the quiet ambiance, are you?
Laura A.}Brooklyn, NY}234}342}1228}-1}4}12/1/2009}There is so many ways I could write about it and tell you how good it was that I don't know if to focus in the sake, the food or the ambiance since each one can overpass the other.Located in an area with probably the highest 4-5 Yelp-rates concentration don't be tempted to go into Soba Totto or Sushi Yasuda just because its easier to see it; I know, it's right next door and it worth a visit for sure, I'll tell you soon, but you can't miss Sakagura. This time you will need to remember this: 211E Basement #1... Basement.. very importantYou can breath the ambiance of beautiful clandestinity at the first step. Traditional Japanese decor full of what we all like; noren, bamboo, plants, bright and with an impressive bar decorated with sake bottles all kinds over a shelf covering the wall.Nigori is the sake that I most like, is unfiltered sake resulting in a cloudy drink, the sweatiest, where sometimes you can even taste the rice grains already powdered.. I guess I'm that rustic compare with my friends. Attending my wishes but pleasuring everyone, we order sparkling Nigori.. First time I hear about it; a dark green bottle filled with Sake in 2 separate phases, aqueous in the half top and a milky solution, formed for the rice residues, in the half bottom. Delicately mixed for our "sake server"  the bottom cloud slowly fused and dominate the aqueous part becoming a uniform white pale liquid served in flute type glasses. It wasn't that rustic at all, right?. The perfect food pairing this sake was suggested in the menu and so we order the Scallop sashimi with mango vinaigrette, a mayonnaise type sauce very tasty that I didn't like. Just personal preferences, tho. But I swear the scallops worth the time I spent draining out the sauce, either in flavor and texture, melting in our mouth in a way that I can't believe it was meat.  It takes some time to decide our next Sake round. We decided finally the one that Sakagura just run out that night; it was a limited edition.. among 200 that they have.. great :/ . We were already in love with that Sake; forget about it was impossible; replace it takes a while, "2 sake servers", that take it as a challenge, and at least 6 sake shots (maybe more?) until we taste one that satisfied all of us. Most of them was excellent, tho. In the mean time, food was coming, Food that also takes some time to order.. since the menu is not that little and everything sounds amazing. A Maguro Tartar, an Uzaku, a Gindara yuan yak (grilled cod in special soy sauce), a Gyu Miso Nikomi (Shredded Beef Back Ribs stewed in Miso),  a Chawanmushi (Steamed Egg Custard) a Yuba shumai (Minced Pork Dumpling) and another half bottle of sake later (plus the shots) we were so happy that we even didn't care about the fact that they forget the tofu that I ordered. They just annulled the order and we were ready for the dessert. Let me say that I loved all the dishes. But that the Uzaku, which is Grilled Eel Vinaigrette Served with Thin Cucumber Slices and Wakame Seaweed and the Maguro tartar, Tuna with yuzu-steeped roe & caviar served over a bed of cucumber slices, juts take my breath away. For dessert we order Black sesame cream brulee and Sea Salt Chocolate ice cream.. as good as it sounds. The cream brulee was as good as the one you get at Cha An and about the sea salt chocolate ice cream,  you have to like "weird" chocolate. I tasted it before; sea salt truffles are one of my faves; this one was very well balanced with just a touch of saltTo finish this history just 2 things remain to be said,- Atif I, you was right- and..  why not a five? well... 5 means being perfect and among others small things, there was for me 2 main imperfections at Sakagura: 20 min waiting to be seated (even we arrived on time) and that they didn't realize before that our beloved sake was run out However, don't tell anyone else, but I'm not always demanding perfection
Sarah W.}Brooklyn, NY}415}221}81}-1}4}11/29/2009}I was a bit late (10 min) for the reservation because I was outside of plain midtown builing waiting for my friends, texting and calling but no replies. I decided to just go down but the basement looked a bit too much like a boiler room.... No wonder no phone receptions... But walking in, I see my party still waiting for the table and some lively steaming food scenes going on and stomach awakening aromas kicked my nostrils. Suddenly the hostess asked for my coat to check and apologized for our wait. It was packed but her apology and the immediate well-manner made up for it.The place is dimly lit but cozy. I like the Chrysanthemum flower arrangemenet on our table. The whole place is colored like bamboo and brown rice papers - even the flowers.  The menu books were nicely hard covered and thick. I like the fact that the sake menu had a map of Japan with name of regions written so that we can relate with where the sakes are from since the sakes are mostly categorized by the regions. We had some sparkling unfiltered wine as a starter but I was not so fond of it. it was a bit felt like 3 layered notes than balanced. There was one of sakes that I was just wanting to try. it was listed in limited edition page decribed to have baked apple note. We got to taste before we buy the bottle($82) and we all absolutely loved it.  But the waiter came back and said that the last bottle has been just used. arhhhhhhh..........  From then on, we were constantly suggested to try different sakes until we found our choice. All the staffs are Japanese and seemed natives as well. They were knowledgeable about sakes, not to mention having some pride in the culture.  Foodwise, it certainly was home-cooking. Mostly I feel dishes were mildly seasoned but so fragrant and well balanced. I personally think that it is their seasoning soy sauce/vinegar. They probably had their own soy sauce but vinegretted. It means it is not from Kikoman bottle... LOL Korean call this "Jang-Maht" literally meaning - Soy Sauce Taste where the food of the house or place depends on soy sauce of the house since traditionally every home brew their own soy sauce/vinegar in Asia. For example, the grilled Eel came with pickled fresh cucumber slices and also marinated with seaweed and cucumber sliced.. the marination was simple, the vinegretted soy sauce or some aged vinegrette. I could taste this sauce in many other dishes. I assume that the soy sauce or vinegrette is from aged pickled juice - Korean called this "Jang-Ah-Chi", which such as garlic, plum/apricot (Umeboshi), Dai-kon and etc get pickled in the mixture of simmered and cooled down water, soy sauce. vinegar and sugar or syrup. Therefore, even without much addition, the whole dish has mysterious savoriness and is whole. I love love this cucumber slices and it cleanses your mouth between dishes very well but also it mixes very well with sakes. Apparently, my appetite went skyrocked and I went to Asian market(Han-Ah-Reum) to buy some garlic Jang-Ah-Chi ($2.99) today. The first dish was scallop sashimi with mango sauce but the mango sauce was so rich that almost tasted like Uni(Sea Urchin). The tuna tartare was excellent and I could not stop eating wanting more, not to mention the beautiful plating. I wasn't so crazy about the pork Shu-mai which was A OK. Grilled Black Cod got high marks on the texture. The dessert, the black sesame creme buree was the star. The puree was very creamy and delicious not being overly rich goes so well with the ice cream - oh so heavenly. However, Nah for the sea salt chocholate. It was way to salty and the salty kicks were so intense even to the degree of surprise.Since we had tried so many sakes before we made our choice (trials were only 6 sakes!!) top of our two bottles, we got all very tipsy. One of our tipsy friend went to the bathroom and came back so excited with the bidet buttons. I am sure he must had some good time in there playing with it. hahahaAll nicely food and wined, each spent about $70 each. The hostess already grabbed my coat, waiting to help me put on while I was hehe with my friends a little buzzed. Good life, good food - I promised them that I would be back soon.
Ken K.}Chadds Ford, PA}0}29}1}-1}5}11/28/2009}Excellent sake list. Should make a reservation. Also great Japanese food besides sushi.
Christine M.}New York, NY}8}97}0}-1}4}11/23/2009}its in a discreet location but the food is good and they have so many different sakes.  Good place to bring out of towners
Miles W.}New York, NY}47}57}0}-1}5}11/20/2009}Great food and a tremendous sake selection. Although expensive, I am looking forward to visting again soon!
Kealan C.}New York, NY}138}144}4}-1}5}11/9/2009}It's a big American tourism trend to want things to be legit, local, un-Disneyfied. Whether or not all of this need for "local flavor" has become touristy itself is another subject, but one thing is for sure, the Japanese aren't buying it. If you have friends from Japan or do business with the Japanese, you're probably familiar with the fact that they don't want our stinkin' hot dogs when they come to the States, they want Japanese food! Such was my luck when a Japanese friend came to visit from Tokyo and suggested Sakagura. Located in a brightly lit, typical Midtown office building, you'll walk down a flight of stairs to find yourself turning Japanese, you'll think you're turning Japanese, I really think so. It's amazing - 30 seconds ago you were listening to the security guard sing along to Marvin Gaye on a staticy radio, and now you're in Tokyo. Going with my Japanese friend definitely added to the experience as he took the reins and ordered everything for us along with the waiter's recommendations. The daily specials that we tried were amazing and fresh, but Daikon salad, jaga dango (mashed potatoes coated and fried in a donut batter - YUM), shrimp balls, cold udon, and rice balls are on the regular menu and were very tasty. I loved everything we ate, but the real standout was the sake and we had two bottles of the smoothest I've ever tasted. I don't know what was ordered, but it was so, so good and I'm not sure you could go wrong with anything your waiter might suggest. If you're going to get dessert (which, um, obvi, always get dessert) get the black sesame creme brulee. I had the sea salt chocolate sorbet, which was great, but I found myself taking advantage of my boyfriend's smarter ordering and ate an unfair portion of his creme brulee. What are sig. others for, right? All in all, a really fun, unique experience that I'll definitely be trying to replicate again, even sans friends from Tokyo. Oh, and PS: the smart toilets in the bathroom? Yeah, they work on a sensor, so try as you might to view a miniature Old Faithful, you're unfortunately going to have to be sitting . . . and I wouldn't recommend messing with that if you're on a date.
Justine D.}Newark, NJ}528}471}143}-1}5}11/3/2009}I was taken here for my birthday and I could not have asked for better food or dining experience.  You will have to forgive me, my birthday was over a month ago, and I'm old.  My memory is steadily declining as is expected with the aging process.  We ordered the sashimi 5 piece sampler, which was a special of the night.  Every piece of fish was thick, fresh, and screaming to be devoured.  I'm not a fan of uni, but I happily licked a rock on the bottom of the ocean floor. And let me tell you, it tasted damn good.  That clearly is a sign of good fresh fish, because Jason C. makes me eat uni and it never tastes like that.   We next had a seared scallop/s with an egg yolk vinaigrette.  I believe that was a special for the night as well.  The vinaigrette was a little to strong for my liking and probably a little to cholesterol laden.  I'd pass pass on it next time.  If you are going to get anything get the fluke carpaccio and the other fluke dish, Hirame Ponzu.  These two dishes are out of this world good.  I could literally eat plate after palate of olive oil joy and citrus bliss.  I would go back just for these two plates. Of course I had to get the maguro tartar because I love maguro and caviar.  Only thing I love more than caviar is Champagne and gold.  This clearly was a given, a delicious given.  I would get this again as well.  The fried shrimp balls covered in almonds didn't hit my spot.  Boo.  They tasted very dry and I would have preferred them in some sort of dipping sauce.  We ordered more, however my memory fails.  Every raw fish dish was fresh and the execution of flavors is on point, as well as the presentation.  Not only did I receive dessert for my birthday, but was get sung to and had a nice Polaroid photo to take home with me.   I would suggest going with a large group so you can sample as many dishes as possible from the vast selection of small plates.  On a final note, the bathrooms are like little tikis with the coolest toilets on the planet.  Not only was my bum warm upon sitting, but I was able to play with all the settings.  I had my bum cleaned, my cooter cleaned, and I'm pretty sure everything dried.  That is some high tech shit.
Junkfoodie Q.}NY, NY}12}372}0}-1}5}10/27/2009}4.5 stars.We shared the filet mignon over hot stone, grilled duck with slice of scallion, fluke sashimi with salmon roe, seaweed salad, chopped salmon sashimi mixed with kimchee over rice, beef back ribs in a miso stew, soba, tuna sashimi with natto, and black sesame breme brulee.My favorite was the beef back ribs in the miso stew with grated daikon radish.  The broth was so rich and flavorful without being too salty, the ribs extremely tender, an amazing dish!  The seaweed salad came with 4 different types of seaweed, very unique! I've never had so many different types of seaweed! The duck was very tender, each piece accompanied with a slice of scallion.  The filet mignon came as 6-8 raw pieces and was served with a hot stone and a piece of steak fat.  The fat was rubbed all over the stone, and we were able to cook the meat to our liking.  A scoop of msg and a small bowl of soy dipping sauce completed this interesting dish!  All the other dishes were very fresh and tasty!  The waiter brought out a second hot stone for the steak when he saw that our stone was cooling off (and not really cooking the meat anymore).  Service was prompt and very attentive.  A wonderful find!! Especially if you want to dine izakaya-style and NOT be in a loud place...Thanks T!
D K.}東京都, Japan}5}57}22}-1}4}10/27/2009}If you're never been there you should take the low ratings with a grain of salt --No, this is *not* a sushi restaurant. It's a izakaya and all of the food reflects that. If you're not familiar with the concept, a izakaya is essentially a "Japanese pub." This place is basically translated as... sake ground, just call it "drinking hole."As for the people complaining about the price...I'd take that with a grain of salt as well. It fairly priced, like a typical izakaya should be. Our party consisted of three, we ate a lot of food, I drank two beers (the money waster), and the bill hovered around $70. Check out the pictures, these are things you will have trouble finding in most "Japanese" restaurants in the U.S. (though those of you in NY are generally lucky given the high number of Japanese-owned businesses in Manhattan). The layout and atmosphere does feel like you're in shinjuku--even the building, once you walk in, reminds me of Japan--so if you've been to Tokyo and are nostalgic for an izakaya, I'd check this place out. Or maybe if you're in the mood for a free Japanese lesson.I know this place advertises their sake; if you're concerned about the price then here's some advice: don't drink it! But if you eat out often or have common sense then you already know this...I wish they had a few more items on the menu such as takoyaki, or maybe even katsuo sashimi, but I'll come back!
Emily W.}Boston, MA}359}65}1}-1}3}10/21/2009}Myabe this review will end up being a little redundant given all the other reviews of this place, but I will say that Sakagura does a great job with ambiance but I found the menu to be a little redundant.Great dishes I had included the chilled roast duck, fluke carpaccio, roasted pork and black seasame creme bruleDisappointments: the kimchi chirashi dish was super salty and the fish was looked and tasted like discarded leftovers from cutting up sushi and sashimi. The tuna with mountain yam was pretty flavorless and the service was extremely spotty. Our waitress left half way through the meal and wasn't ever replaced so we had to flag down several people to bring the check, take the check, and finally bring back the credit card bill.I would go back to try some of the other dishes but it's definitely not a must-go for me
Tom I.}Fort Lauderdale, FL}150}1313}2059}-1}1}10/19/2009}If you have big budget (like folks work for the UN) and want to impress someone, you will enjoy it. For me, I will never go back. Food is over priced for what it is, and portion is way too small. Re. Sake collection, I really don't think they have the best selection in town. I actually hosted a Japanese sake distributor's executive one night, and he also commented that it's over priced and hyped. He called this place "Japanese disney world in Manhattan". Oh, here's the funniest story, if you are a Japanese or have lived in Japan you will laugh so hard: We asked for umeboshi for our drinks, and when our bill comes we almost fell of the chair, they charged for umeboshis! What!? I never heard any Japanese bar charging umeboshi. We asked for manager but sure enough, they charge EVERYTHING at this place. That's so Americanized in my opinion. Sure they did really great job creating Japanese environment and I can see its good place to feel like Japan, but we aren't buying it. bye bye Sakagura, good luck ripping off from UN folks. Hahaha.
Cary L.}New York, NY}100}111}137}-1}4}10/13/2009}I love this place, the first time my friends took me here, I was like where are we going?  Its in the basement of a nondescript office building.  And Well worth it.  Not traditional sushi, great sakes, great fish and a great atmosphere.
Shannon M.}Daly City, CA}1}8}0}-1}5}10/13/2009}I love this place!  It has fantastic food... said that not Americanized so if you are looking for a sushi roll with Philadelphia cream cheese in it you are looking at the wrong place!Reservations are needed at peak hours and there are often more japense diplomats eating here than not during lunch since its so near the UN.
Dario B.}San Francisco, CA}179}464}5}-1}4}10/12/2009}I've been wanting to eat here since March when Yumi and I were talking about original Japanese shelters in New York. Happens to be from the same owners of Decibel and since then my curiosity grew constantly.Long story short, we went there on a Thursday and had the $11.50 soba lunch special (only 50 available) and Oyako Don with an awesome buckwheat beer from Oregon. Simply fantastic and clearly a solid lunch option if you happen to be in NY. Soba is handmade, with a pleasant texture/chewiness and a rich buckwheat finish. Yumi tells me from their own organic farm but I wasn't able to find the info.The place got packed in 20 minutes around noon so be sure to make a reservation if you want to grab your lunch special, a serious deal including soba and a seasonal chirashi (changes everyday). The rice was just perfect and overall you will find yourself here again and again, just for the cozy ambiance. I seriously would have had a hard time finding it considering that it's nested below an office building, somehow the same secluded location of Decibel. An absolute must, straight from Yumi's repertoire.
Cindy C.}New York, NY}77}217}4}-1}5}10/9/2009}Hidden in the basement of an office building, this place had the best lunch deals, an array of sake and the best black sesame creme brulee ever!!!! Good place for lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, drinks or a date late at night. You feel like your transported to a little town in Japan.For more reviews visit my blog.

Kirk F.}San Jose, CA}36}441}4}-1}5}9/28/2009}I've spent a lot of time in Tokyo, and this is the closest I've come to a Tokyo sake bar--outside of Tokyo.  The experience of walking into the painted cinder-block basement of an office building to find a restaurant-oasis was just like back in Shinjuku.  The sake list was amazing.  The food was tasty--especially the grilled eggplant with different kinds of miso paste, but also the various preparations of tofu, pork dumplings, all sorts of snacks.  Come here with time to graze and several friends so you can try a bunch of different things.By the way, I think this works for kids who are even a little bit adventurous.  We brought two 9-year-old boys, and the great thing about having a lot of little plates of food on the table is that if they don't like one thing, they can move on to the next, and if they like that maybe we get a second plate for them.  Our kids both tried things they never ate before and were proud of their efforts to try new things.  We were seated in the corner so the minor chopstick/sword fight went unnoticed by the other patrons who were happily tasting/swilling their sake.  I don't know if everyone would consider this a "kid's" restaurant--there was no one below 25 in the room besides our two guys-- but we made it work great!
Jade D.}Foster City, CA}32}62}7}-1}4}9/28/2009}Went here with my parents when they were in town and we all loved it. Was a bit decieving from the entrance, but is like a hidden world downstairs. Decor is traditional Japanese, high ceilings, a bit modern but without losing the authenticity. Tried a bit of everything: sashimi, tofu, eel,  duck, sesame creme brulee. Great sake. Sake martini was delicious as it looked. Portions are a bit small and we left a bit hungry (there were 10 of us). Highly recommend.
Justine H.}New York, NY}61}141}0}-1}3}9/25/2009}i know this place is supposed to be a 5 star place, and im nearly positive that i didnt fully enjoy it bc i didn't order the right things, but regardless, the place was just ok every time i went. i'm going back at some point bc i refuse to believe that while everyone else in the world loves this place, i barely liked it. for now, 3 stars. stay tuned for updates.
Julie G.}Los Altos, CA}0}104}0}-1}4}9/23/2009}an oldie but a goodie. great date place.
Natasha B.}Sydney, Australia}151}198}84}-1}5}9/18/2009}It's hard to find a decent Japanese lunch in NYC without feeling like you shelled out too much for it. Even harder to find a fancy Japanese dinner that actually left you with a feeling that you got what you paid for (*cough* Megu). Saka Gura wowed me with its lunch bowls and desert. The menu was creative and executed beautifully.  I tried Oyako Don ($11.50) with Wisdom Sake tasting ($10), and for dessert, a beautiful sesame creme brulee, which turned out to be the best desert I ever had in a Japanese restaurant (no yucky sticky rice buns). I can't wait to try the truffles, next time. Tucked away int he basement with no cell phone service, Sakagura is truly a treasure for some authentic(?) and quality Japanese cuisine and  a great sake infused conversation (that is given your friend/s find the place) Everything here is definitely worth price, and flavors won't leave you disappointed.
Jeffrey M.}Los Angeles, CA}0}26}0}-1}5}9/15/2009}Favorite restaurant in NYC.  Braised pork belly is my single favorite dish on the planet.  Been coming since 2000 and this place is consistently delicious.  10 stars.
Nina R.}New York, NY}1}1}0}-1}4}9/15/2009}My friend and I went there for their Natsumatsuri festival and I must say we were impressed by the food and the service. The food portion was small but still decent for the price because even though it was not that big, it can still fill you up and the quality of the food is exceptional. They also have a wide variety of sake and they gladly assist you in choosing your preference. We ordered the Sanma Onigiri and Sake Oyako Don, and both were very tasty and filling. Service is fast and the wait staff is very courteous and accommodating.A japanese friend also recommended this restaurant, which was another reason why we went. This japanese place could be a little pricey but if you are going for quality and authenticity, Sakagura is highly recommended.
mary l.}New York, NY}237}327}9}-1}5}9/15/2009}Wow - I had no expectations walking into this place and in every aspect, my mind was blown away.  The location is part of its charm; you walk into an office building, go down a staircase and all of a sudden find yourself in a cozy traditional looking Japanese restaurant.  There is a sake cellar and sapporo on draft - yum!  4 of us STUFFED ourselves for about $200 including tip and it was THE best Japanese food I have eaten.  The table ordered jagadango [potato croquette things] that were INCREDIBLY fluffy and not oily, a sashimi platter with the most sea urchin i have ever seen served in one plate, duck with green onions, two servings of soba, and the chocolate sea salt ice cream and the black sesame truffles for dessert.  The meal was followed with that really great green tea that almost smells like fresh plants and tastes like popcorn.  Additionally the service was excellent and the bathrooms were clean, modern and really fun.I can't wait to take my foodie brother here; it was the best Saturday night treat.
Aka C.}New York, NY}34}98}26}-1}4}9/14/2009}I've ordered the lunch special every time I've gone, but the food has always been really good and the service is excellent. The soba lunch sets are generally pretty decent, but we've usually ordered the "Jewel" Oke Bento plus the Soba Gozens, even the taster set. Everything is fresh and delicious. I plan to go back next time for dinner because I am really curious about their dinner menu and their selection of sake (drinking during lunch is not the best work practice... so I try not to).I actually like their setting a lot. The place is hard as hell to find (in the basement of an office building next to a garage!?), so you won't find many random people there. Usually people know what they are in for. Also, I am very amused at the bathrooms. They're always fun to point out to people who're there the first time.
Daniel F.}Flushing, NY}679}598}1023}18}4}9/13/2009}Nice little japanese place, with lots and lots of sake selections.  The waitress seems to know a lot about each kind and which were good and which ones we should not try.   Each dish is very small, and it felt like a japanese dimsum style kind of dinner where we all picked off a little of each plate.  Just like everyone else who has reviewed this restaurant, the kaisen kim-chee don was great.  the assorted chopped sashimi mixed with kimchee and rice was filling and satisfied my sushi cravings.  The tuna Tartar is another recommendation i have for you sushi lovers.  The Caviar on top of the tartar went quite well together.  To top it off, we were celebrating 2 friends birthdays and the waitress knew, so she asked me for their names and then came out with a bday song and candles during the dessert.  And whipped out a classic Polaroid camera to take our picture which we were able to keep.  Also must have the dessert dish Black sesame creme brulee.  you'll love it , I gurantee it.
Xue T.}New York, NY}81}145}333}-1}4}9/12/2009}Definitely recommend sitting at the bar - it was so convenient for our waitress to grab some sake behind her for our tasting. We tried 5 sakes before we chose "Pride of the Village" (sorry that can be wrong since my memory was impaired due to overdose =) My favorite dishes were also Fluke Carpaccio (SO FRESH), Kaisen Kim-Chee Don and melt in your mouth Truffles! go for the green tea!
Kitten T.}New York, NY}2}22}0}-1}4}9/12/2009}This place is great; very non-descript signage, once you enter downstairs, you feel like you are no longer in NYC.  While sharing a bunch of things with friends, I highly recommend the Kaisen Kim-Chee Don which is assorted sashimi with kimchi and rice.  The black sesame creme brulee is an amazing way to end your meal here.  Another note, you have to check out the bathrooms.
Henry T.}Arlington, VA}12}66}30}-1}5}9/12/2009}Yes, it's true.This place is awesome. It's tucked away in the basement of a generic, midtown office building.But Sakagura has transformed the basement into a small traditional japanese village. Very classy, nothing cheesy.The Saki list: ridiculous. Dozens of pages, detailing hundreds of saki.The food: excellent as well. The dishes are small, so you should older 2-3 per person for sharing.Will definitely go back soon.
Tim L.}Sunnyvale, CA}24}118}0}-1}4}9/11/2009}Sakagura was good.   But not great.Gochi in the Bay Are is better than Sakagura.The location is cool and pretty hidden (just walk through the parking arage)As for dishes, the fluke and duck were the best dishes.The cold duck wrapped around scallions were amzing and extremely memorable (a must try).
Donna Z.}Woodhaven, NY}59}69}11}-1}4}9/10/2009}Went for a girl's night out. Dinner for two included:1) KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON : Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over Rice [Served with Miso Soup] $13.002) KAMO ROAST : Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce $9.503) FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf $10.00 4)  BUTA KAKUNI : SAKAGURA'S SPECIAL Stewed Diced Pork $4.50 (Per piece) 5) GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI : Beef Tongue Stewed in a Miso Served with Slices of Daikon Radish, Taro Potato, Spinach, and Shiitake Mushrooms $12.50  6) DESSERT:BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE with Black Sesame Ice Cream $7.00 and TRUFFLESAmazing food and a great dining experience: PricelessMy favorite dishes were: 3)Fluke Carpaccio and 1) Kaisen Kim-Chee Don 6) TrufflesThe truffles is very very good. It is very rich in flavor, yet subtle. At first they look very ordinary and if you were not savoring it, you probably won't even notice the levels of flavor that slowly come up. Service was good. We sat at the bar, our water was never empty. Plates were cleared fairly regularly. We had the opportunity to taste different sakes before we ordered and when we ordered one glass, our server was nice enough to have the initiative to put it in two glasses for us without us having to ask. Still thinking about the truffles. The subtle richness...Mmmmm!
Pamela K.}New York, NY}243}276}182}18}5}9/8/2009}Sakagura (if you can find it!) is consistently amazing. There's something about going completely subterranean, sans cell phone reception or linkage to the outside world, that adds to the overall character and authenticity of this place.I especially enjoy trying as many different small plates as possible each visit -- the uniqueness and variety are surprising in all the right ways. Food favorites include: sardine crackers, fried mashed potatoes coated in sweet batter, fluke carpaccio, stewed pork, and thin beef fillets slices (cooked on a hot stone). Desserts: chocolate souffle cake and black sesame creme brulee. Sake: An endless selection with staff "picks", which include descriptions and recommended food pairings.Service is great. Food+drinks can get pricey, but I always feel like it's worth it. Wonderful place for a special meal.
Jessica Y.}Los Angeles, CA}26}20}1}-1}5}9/3/2009}My new favorite izakaya restaurant ever. I've been to a few others in New York and Los Angeles, and none have compared to the authenticity I felt here. The ambiance is nice in a dimly lit, wooden décor setting. There were many notable items on the menu and a fully stocked sake bar. For my party of 5, we ordered somewhere upwards of 20 dishes. It wasn't cheap, and we were squished into a tiny table- but were still delighted each time a new dish arrived at our table. The names of the dishes were all in Japanese so you should have an idea of what you're ordering beforehand (ordering right can make all the difference for your experience here). Of all the well-known dishes, the special buta-kakuni (pork belly) was the only item that didn't live up to all the hype. It is not for those that shy away from fat and in my opinion large enough for 2 to share. We had each ordered our own portions and had quite a bit leftover. Definitely leave room for dessert- we tried both the sesame crème brulee and chocolate soufflé and they were the perfect cap to an amazing meal. The restaurant itself is pretty hidden from street level (with poor reception in the basement) so if you are coming with a large party it is probably best to meet outside before going in. I almost want to take away a star (or -0.5 stars?) for the hostess that gave us a bit of attitude when they had to rearrange the seating to fit 5 instead of 4 people. I didn't find the friendliest of service people here, but its ok- the food wholly makes up for it.
Wakako U.}San Francisco, CA}857}1276}4}-1}5}8/23/2009}I thought I was in Japan for a minute...stylish restaurant in the basement of an ugly office building is very common in Japan.  I liked the black sesame creme brulee more then any savory dish. Impressive sake offering, but what would one expect from a restaurant named Sakagura.  Toto washlet is a nice touch.
Stella K.}New York, NY}28}326}1}-1}5}8/13/2009}One visit and I fell in love. I don't drink so their sake collection doesn't even have anything to do with it (though it's a big plus for my husband.) One of the best Japanese restaurants we've ever been to, for sure. Every single dish we had there was excellent. We had salmon tataki, tuna tartare, chawanmushi, seaweed salad, roast duck roll, and grilled cod for those of you who are curious. And of course black sesame creme brulee to finish, which was sublime. I love black sesame flavored desserts, and this was one of the best I've ever had. It's not cheap, especially considering the portions are quite small, but I felt it was worth every penny. I can't wait to go back, and I have a feeling I'll be bumping it up to five stars once I have a couple more visits under my belt! This place totally deserves 4.5 average stars that it has right now (a rarity on Yelp) and if you've been thinking about going, you should not walk, but run to this place!Edited:Two more visits since then and it's officially five stars. This place is freakin' awesome and truly one of the kind. I've also been told there's not another restaurant in this country with a sake list that rivals Sakagura's.
Duy L.}Lawndale, CA}86}315}0}-1}5}8/10/2009}Thursday night, 6/4/09I follow my cousin who is taking me to a Japanese restaurant she loves.  She also mentions that the duck there is the best her fiance has ever had, anywhere.  I'm excited because she loves to dine, and she's paying tonight, haha.The place is down in the basement, and I feel as if I'm crawling a dungeon to discover a secret shop.  Indeed, I find myself at the entrance of a bustling restaurant, dimly lit, with an old Japanese town feel to it.  (Actually, the place really reminded me of an Edo-themed onsen I like to go to in Tokyo).I see that the staff is Japanese, and I can even hear the loud chattering of Japanese business men just inside.  Usually, my cousin tells me, the place is usually packed and you need a reservation... but we're in luck and they have a table open!We are seated, and ask the waitress for a sake recommendation.  We want a dry one, and she has a few recommendations.  We order a cold one that she says is "very dry."Our first order comes out, and though I forget what it was, it was awesome.  The second was the hirame ponzu, I believe, and it's delicate texture and flavors were a joy to experience.The sake was indeed VERY dry.  The waitress knew what she was talking about, and I enjoyed the sake very much.  It went down smooth, and I felt we could eventually handle a second bottle.  My cousin laughed and asked me if I was sure I could drink more, cause the sake might creep up.  But, we ordered a second one that was less dry anyway.The next dish was the duck (kamo roast) she had been raving about (though she doesn't eat meat, other than chicken, herself).  Wow.  It was good.  The cut was just the way I like most of my meat, with a thin edge of fat.  The presentation was very nice too, with each slice wrapped around scallion.  Seriously, it was damn good.Next was the soft shell crab.  It too was good, though I don't remember it being amazingly remarkable.  I think we also ordered a walnut-encrusted shrimp ball (based on the picture I took), but I don't think it was too remarkable either (nor can I find something about it on the current online menu).The second sake bottle came out, as well as the eggplant (sanshoku nasu dengaku).  It was less dry, and equally refreshing.  The miso (of the eggplant dish) had a great flavor that cleansed the gritty nuts of the previous dish.Our final dish was a bit of a disappointment -- a bowl of hot udon.  The udon had... vermicelli noodles it seemed like.  I've never had udon noodles that thin.  Also, the soup was rather insipid.  But the warmth of the noodles did wash the meal down satisfactorily, and I walked out very happy.If I'm ever back in town, I'd definitely come back to try the other items on the menu.  This easily ranks as one of my favorite meals.p.s. as I walked out, the sake really hit... and when I got off the train, I told my cousin to keep walking as I dashed to the nearest trash can to throw up.  All in all, a great night =)
Daniel S.}Chicago, IL}334}60}0}-1}4}8/8/2009}After looking for the entrance for 10 minutes, only to discover I was right in front of it the whole time, I was delighted and surprised by some very interesting and unique food. The wait staff was more than willing to take the time to explain the vagaries of their menu to my thoroughly western pallet. So was the Sake Sommelier (?). All in all, while some of the things I tried were probably a stretch for my conservative taste buds, I have a strong feeling that to a more knowledgeable patron, this place would score well.
Hideki K.}New York, NY}466}1079}310}-1}4}8/7/2009}Yes to Sakagura's Duck Curry Udon!Too bad this tasty dish is only a weekday lunchtime offering. I waited so long to try this meal.  Since I cannot take workday lunches in Manhattan, I had to wait until I used a vacation day.  It was well worth the wait!
JW S.}Brooklyn, NY}0}21}0}-1}4}8/6/2009}Wowzerz.... It is good. Yup, all four of us were happy. Truly authentic Japanese Sake bar experience. Its pricey but I thought it was all worth it. One nice big bottle of their summer sake and another half bottle, 7 things of appetizers and one entree portion of  Kaisen Don, 3 desserts. The total bill came out appx $200. I was happy to pay for that. These are the things we got.Kamo roast - the best!! (nicely chilled tender duck roast, 6 thin slices)Maguro tartare - loved it! (portion good enough for 4. but i could use more of this.)Gindara yuna yaki - loved the buttery texture of cod, a bit salty. Ebi stick - so so. thinly rolled fried shrimp roll. also a tad salty.  Jaga dango -  loved its fun factor. double fun of doughnut and mashed potatoes. Tori karaage - nice big chunks of fried chicken. Tori tsukune - not my fav, but others loved it. chicken meatballs.Kaisen Kimchee don - LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! just about the perfect mix of kimchee and sashimi. this will fill you up as an entree.  Goma brulee - good, but not as fantastic as how i was told from others.Souffle - just a ok, can easily get the better souffle from somewhere else perhaps. SAKE - the big bottle was $63, the half bottle $32. can't remember the names but both were delicious.overall, Id love to go back there again for other things that we hadn't tried. even w/ the reservation, we're waiting for another 15 mins. obviously very busy even during the weekdays. I can see myself walking in for their lunch specials one day.
Alexis L.}New York, NY}35}150}31}-1}4}8/4/2009}Busy (even on a Monday night) but the sake selection (I had a staff recommendation, Hiroki, delicious) is worth a try and the food pairs drinks nicely. I second others when they say you should eat slowly for the sake of your wallet.The bar is a good place to have dinner at and the general noise level of the place is quite acceptable.
Yumi A.}New York, NY}33}136}15}-1}4}7/31/2009}Food here is a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds.  Portions are tiny but if you sip your sake and nibble in a leisurely manner, eventually you'll feel full.  Remember, it takes ~20 minutes for your brain to register satiety so just think you're doing your health (and your wallet) a favor by appreciating food slowly  :p I also love the miniature tumblers they use as ochoko.  They  look like a mini version of Riedel O glasses and are adorable.  Quality sake deserves to be served elegantly.  Note to self: ask where I can get a set of these next time I go.  Some of my favorite dishes here are: jidori shioyaki, nasu dengaku, and shiromi nanban (correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen this dish in any other izakaya around here).  I've never tried dessert here because whenever I eat out, I try to order alcohol or dessert, but never both in a meager attempt to cut down on calories.  But if your metabolism is sky high, please do try the pear mille feuille for me and tell me how it is.
Annette F.}New York, NY}3}35}3}-1}5}7/30/2009}Hands down the best Japanese sake bar in the city.  There are really too many amazing dishes to list - I have never been disappointed.  It is tempting to order just everything on the menu   Service is typical Japanese, which means close to perfection.  Even the washrooms are very Japanese...  they used to give out pamplets of those heated super-automated machines, but I digress.  You just gotta try it.  Musts for me are the buta-kakuni (pork belly), the miso eggplant dish, chicken meatballs.  Oh and yes, of course, the sesame creme brulee and the chocolate souffle.
Jennifer L.}Oakland, CA}64}45}1}-1}5}7/28/2009}Everything here is delicious and unique. The space itself is pretty cool. Order the Ebi Shinjo, Saikoro Steak, and Black Sesame Cream Brulee. Don't forget to take home some homemade truffles.
Kelly K.}Philadelphia, PA}34}90}9}-1}4}7/26/2009}Where better for a night out alone than to sit at a sushi bar, watching the bustle of the place around you? This hideaway basement restaurant really is more of Japanese tapas...there is very little sushi on the menu. There is, however, a sake menu at least as extensive as the dinner menu. I settled on a nama-zake (unpasteurized sake) tasting with three varieties. My favorite by far was: BORN DAIGINJO MUROKA from Fukui.It had a more complex flavor and nicer finish than the other two, though I enjoyed trying them all. Next time I'd probably just stick with the Born.I started with an eggplant dish from the specials. Pieces of eggplant scored to look much like pieces of fish, in a light broth and sprinkled with bonito flakes, so they even tasted of fish. Never had anything like it. Next up was maguro natto...fresh tuna sashimi served with fermented soy beans. The fish was wonderful and the soybeans were interesting with it, but the ratios seemed a bit off to my palate...I'd rather have a little less of the soybean to the tuna. If you haven't tried the fermented soybeans, they are a bit gooey.The sanma onigiri -- cooked rice balls with shiitake mushroom, pickled radish and mountain vegetables wrapped with baked pike mackerel were wonderful. The mushrooms and vegetables imparted such a savory taste to the rice to pair up with the smoky saltiness of the fish. I absolutely recommend these. They offer a number of varieties of rice balls.At the end of dinner, I was presented with green tea and a dessert menu and couldn't resist the recommendations from other Yelpers for the black sesame creme brulee. I enjoyed it a lot, though I think it would have worked better without the traditional caramelized sugar on top...it just didn't need the extra sweetness with the ice cream and the little wafer provided a nice crispiness.Service was friendly, attentive and unobtrusive throughout. I really recommend a visit to try something different.
Steph C.}Los Angeles, CA}3725}3206}93}18}5}7/16/2009}An underground kingdom of bamboo and sake drums, Sakagura has got it all.  Cozy-chic decor, smooth ambience, unfussy but competent service, and goodness gracious great food.My friend and I opted to sit at the bar so we could replenish our plates at will.  We ordered namazake tastings to go with our meals.  These consisted of small pours of three different types of unpasteurized sake, all of which came with little explanatory laminated cards - a nice touch for the uninitiated (see, e.g., Steph C.).  All three were quite good and each different enough from the others to warrant the tasting.To wash that down, we got a smattering of delicious dishes.  To wit: ichijiku dengaku (figs grilled with miso), gyu miso nikomi (short rib stew), chawanmushi (steamed egg custard), gindara yuan yaki (grilled cod with sweet soy), tori karaage (JFC), and gyutan yawarakani (stewed beef tongue).  The figs were a flavor triumph, sweet, salty, and interesting.  The short rib stew, with soft vegetables and grated daikon, was intensely comforting with a robust broth and fall-apart meat.  I could have done without the chawanmushi, which was overwhelmed by a sour thickened ponzu sauce poured on top.  The chicken, shrimp, and gingko nuts were nice additions, though they made this dish a toughie to split.  Cod was scrumptious, cooked moist and flaky, but isn't it always?  Karaage - big chunks of chicken fried fresh, hot hot through and through - threatened to scorch every nerve in our mouths, but was very tasty.  The beef tongue, stewed in miso with daikon, taro potato, spinach, and shiitake, was a succulent surprise.  Yawaraka means "soft" and they weren't kidding.  I didn't realize huge chunks of tongue could taste so pleasantly fatty.To round out this excellent meal, we ordered the black sesame creme brulee with black sesame ice cream for dessert.  I've had an almost identical dessert at Cha-An in the East Village, and as much as I love that one, Sakagura's version wins hands down.  Smooth and creamy with bold sesame flavors, it is to die for.  Do not miss.I left feeling satisfied but shockingly unbloated.  This means I can eat more next time.  I look forward to it.
Catherine L.}San Francisco, CA}55}145}21}-1}5}7/12/2009}one of my favorite japanese restaurants. but then again, japanese is my favorite cuisine.decor - so bamboo. so japanese-underground. check out the toilet and get a taste of tokyo bathroom-philia. food - frickin tasty. i won't even go into how yummy and savory the dishes are. they're all good. actually, the chicken karage is mediocre - i've had better at other places. but damn, the rest are superb. the green tea truffle dessert is something that, if you don't partake in, would be preventing a well-rounded existence.service - typical attentive, polite japanese. i think we got warm hand towels and what not. price is what it is. excellent food for reasonable prices. you get what you pay for. one thing i love about this place is the cool utensils and set up of the dishes. i love how the japanese obsess over presentation and extraneous tools. they have one dish where you head raw chunks of beef on a heated stone.
S S.}Bronx, NY}26}17}0}-1}5}7/12/2009}I don't think I even need to review this place, but my meal was so outstanding that I will anyway.Located in the basement of an office building, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. After walking down the stairs and winding through some hallways that could have just led to a boiler room, I stood before the waiting area of a Japanese restaurant. My friend and I got there early, so we didn't have to wait even though we had no reservations. We had the Hiyayakko, Maguro Yamakakke, Gyutan Yawaraka ni and the Kaisen Kimchi Don. Appetizers:The Hiyayakko  was the loveliest piece of tofu that I've had in a very long time, perfect texture, perfect amount of onion and bonito on top. The Maguro Yamakakke might not be for everyone, but I love mountain yam in all it's forms and hardly ever have it at home, so I had to order it, the flavors are very simple, mostly from the soy sauce that I added, but the texture of the yam and taste and texture of the tuna in it were excellent.The Main Dishes, I will definitely order these again!:Gyutan Yawaraka ni: Deliciously slow cooked pieces of tongue in a rich miso base accompanied by tender mushrooms and turnip and potato. The chunks of tongue were a bit large, but they were so tender that I was able to easily splice them with my chopsticks. Kaisen Kimchi Don: The kimchi was delicious, yet not over powering.The sashimi used was so fine it virtually melted in your mouth, half a week later, I'm still thinking about it.Waitstaff were very attentive, very well versed in the menu and suggestions for the food. All around a 5 star establishment!
Tyler C.}Los Angeles, CA}142}151}15}-1}5}7/3/2009}hmm....a sake speakeasy that serves soba...what a concept!   my inaugural foray for soba in NYC landed me in this secret dark wood paneled basement.  the lunch reviews are true - $11.50 special with very good soba, but they have really nice hot and cold soba dishes ranging from $11.50 to $20 on the menu that looked absolutely tasty.    having been in boston for the past 8 yrs...i can now thank the gods a good portion of soba no longer requires airfare to the west coast...i'm not much of a drinker but for those who like to savor a good drink the sake wall is worth seeing...
Cocomero M.}Irvine, CA}1}46}3}-1}5}6/21/2009}I love this place too and all the food was delicious.  It was definitely the highlight of my food adventures in NYC.  They have all kinds of sake and the service was great.  The best part about NYC is that even though we were extremely tipsy, we didn't have to drive home. Just hopped on the subway. Woohoo!
Love M.}New York, NY}8}98}36}-1}4}6/8/2009}I took 1 star off for the price.Otherwise, everything is reliable. You won't go wrong with this place.Clean, tidy, great menu, great selection of sake.Ume cocktail is refreshing. I loved it.
Sophia Y.}San Francisco, CA}73}614}27}-1}5}5/28/2009Updatedreview}just went there again. love that the kitchen closes at 11:45pm on a weeknight.Great japanese service(attentive, helpful, respectful) and food.we got the pork special butaniku - sweet, melts in your mouth, yummyshrimp balls covered in almonds - how can you go wrong with thatochazuke - huge portion of rice - could serve 2soba - my daughter loved!batter covered potato - oh so naughty! free range chicken - with yuzu/pepper and sea salt on sidechawan-mushi - huge portiono- i ordered too much food!finished off with light lychee sorbet (2 scoops) comes with sesame crispdessert comes with hot tea.child friendly - in that they gave us a booth and my kid loved it. though no strollers or high chairs are allowed in for fire reasons.each dish is executed perfectly and beautifullytoilet had automatic up/down for cover! my 2.5 y/o wanted to try the water wash option but I think they disabled it.$110 including tax for all this...
Meesh C.}Irvine, CA}21}29}33}-1}5}5/27/2009}My absolute favorite izakaya place in New York. Pricey yes, worth it definitely! I ate here as soon as I came back from my trip to Japan because I was in a state of depression that I was back in the dirty US.  Great decision because Sakagura took me right back to Tokyo--business men drinking sake, dim lights, cute decor, Japanese speaking waiters, oh and yes, amazing food. The food is not too much of anything--except tasty. Very clean tasting and not sodium-laden like much Japanese restaurant food can get. This is a place to come with a small group, so everyone can share the small dishes and each enjoy a taste of Japan with each chopstick-full. The black sesame icecream dessert is to die for. I have been scouring the city for such deliciousness since dining at Sakagura...the only place that came remotely close was Cha-An in EV (for that specific dessert only). Other memorable dishes include the baked uni, hot stone beef, and the custard-like steamed egg [super authentic, tasted exactly like what I had in Japan]. Oh, and we had a delicious bottle of sake recommended by the waiter. Wish I could remember the name, but it is a small blue bottle meant for two and comes in a decorative little wooden basket.
Evelyn L.}New York, NY}77}149}7}-1}5}5/27/2009}Yes they have a great sake selection but the food is still the best part esp their cooked food.  Last time I went there we ordered the chicken meatballs, the ebi stick, the stewed beef and the fluke marinated in balsamic vinegar.  Every dish had a great combination of flavors.  I also liked the fact that they're small so you can sample a bit of everything. Ambiance is romantic and the service is unobtrusive and professional.  Sit at the bar and you'll get to see desserts being taken out and prepared for guests which is quite fun.
Kami H.}Rowland Heights, CA}10}79}49}-1}4}5/17/2009}I love this place! Great ambiance, service, food & sake selections! The Ume cocktail was really good if you are in the mood for cocktails. Sashimi was fresh and I was surprised to find their Uni super fresh since I was told cooked food is what's good there.Oh and don't forget about desserts! Make sure you save some room for their black sesame creme brulee....very special & really good!
Young P.}Los Angeles, CA}4}129}0}-1}2}5/8/2009}This place is bit difficult to locate if you haven't been here.  I don't think I saw any sign for this restaurant. You have to go into the building and look for stairways (next to security desk & elevators) down to the restaurant. The place is very small. They sat me next  to two noisy people. I've asked to be relocated  to other table, but they stated everything was reserved (they were empty at the time and could have relocated me).I've ordered few different items:- MAGURO YAMAKAKE : Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam: This really didn't taste that good.-EBI SHINJO : Deep Fried Shrimp Balls Covered with Sliced Almonds This was ok. - HIYAYAKKO : Chilled Tofu Topped with Grated Ginger , Scallion and Bonito FlakesThis was one of the worst tofu I've tasted.- Sashimi special: interesting - neo fish, salmon, tunaInteresting fish. It was ok.- BLACK SESAME CREAM BRULEE.  Dessert was very good. Waitress service was good also.
Yi-Fei T.}New York, NY}0}19}0}-1}4}5/3/2009}Wow...I was dying to try this place and I can honestly say it did not dissappoint.  We tried a variety of sakes and assortment of dishes that each hit the spot. With all the wonderful sake we consumed, I wish I could remember more of the dishes....however, I do have a strange craving for fat this last week after the savory buta kakuni.  :-)
Nina L.}Alameda, CA}98}489}75}-1}4}4/26/2009}This place is much more reasonably priced that most places I've been to.  Our table of 4 shared at least 8 different items and our bill was only $125, which included 3 big bottles of beer.  Of the dishes the seaweed salad, cold tofu, chawanmushi, beef cooked on a hot stone, and the house specialty stewed pork were all very good.  One little side note: Stewed pork can be shared between two people.  We made the mistake of ordering one per person and were a little overwhelmed (and guilt-ridden) by the rich fatty goodness.  Be sure to know the address when going for the first time.  There's no signage except for a tiny little sign in the doorway in tiny print.  It's in the basement level of an office building.
Helenhana C.}Los Angeles, CA}106}255}261}-1}5}4/21/2009}s avory mini izayaki style  bara dorable, accentual, alluring mood is perfect fork indling your lost love, friendship, and any relationships.a esthetically pleasant wait staff and decor will be heightened by sake consumptiong o and see it for yourself u  must when you are in town r ead the other reviews and you'll seea ssured by yours truly. ------Try the kamo roast negimaki (slices of chilled roasted duck topped with scallions and basil sauce).Must try the buta kakuni (stewed diced pork belly)Recommend but not highly recommend the gindara yuan yaki (grilled cod fish). it was salty and little too smoked grilled style for me. i like my fish fatty and buttery. Must be in the right mood to have inaniwa udon noodle from akita with spinach. It's rather  plain but the clear broth is unexpectedly tasteful. by the way, don't expect fat thick udon noodles. the noodles are thinner than soba noodles and soft. it's simply delightful but not extraordinary. we need sakagura in la. i miss it... i miss it alot.
B P.}Brooklyn, NY}6}24}0}-1}4}4/20/2009}Japanese food done in a truly Japanese style, with a kick ass selection of sake, waitresses who call me out on my crappy Japanese, and to top it off, the bathrooms are giant sake barrels.... the circle of life.So this place is indeed annoying to find, what with entering the darkened office building in a particularly uninspiring part of midtown (which is saying something).  Once you go past the industrial stairway to the basement entrance, though, it's completely worth it.The decor is beautiful and fun.  If you've been to Tokyo, you know how bland office skyscrapers host some amazing and lovely restaurants on random floors, and this is no different.  The service is appropriately Japanese- overly formal, very quiet, etc, which actually is a nice change from more informal standard nyc style, if only for a night.  I speak a smattering of Japanese, and they totally shot me down with complex answers to my weak Nihon-go questions, so point to them for putting a gaijin in his place.  Srsly, pwned.The sake list is extensive, beautiful, expensive.  Ditto the menu - looks cheap, but wait, there's more!  Excellent 'real' Japanese food- sure, some sashimi and so on, but a ton of great and hard to find dishes.  Example: Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and a Squid Liver Marinade.  I do love my dear mom's squid liver marinade, but this tops it.*  Tapas style, delicious and small- so if you want a full meal, though it looks like you can grab a handfull of $5-7 tapas, it'll take a lot.It can get expensive here, but it's such a wonderful addition to the dark, terrifying food culture of midtown (o shuttered hawaiian tropic zone, we hardly knew ye!) that it's very, very worth a visit.* full disclosure:  my mother is Italian and has never made squid liver marinade.  Comment made for dramatic impact only.   Any similarity to persons living or dead Is purely coincidental.
Wailun C.}New York, NY}9}56}0}-1}5}4/16/2009}Tapas?  Good...Japanese Tapas?  Very Good...Japanese Tapas with Sake?  Very, Very Good...Japanese Tapas with a huge ass selection of Sake?  Quit your AA and Weight Watchers meetings Good!Just don't make the mistake I did and make sure you go with people who appreciates this kind of stuff...
Kimmie S.}New York, NY}87}177}0}-1}5}4/4/2009}Around this time last year, my boyfriend who at the time was someone I was dating, took me to this place. I remember going into an office building's basement and being introduced to a cute Japanese village! If you enjoy sake, this is a great place to go that has a lot of varieties and a huge menu that lets you know all the different regions items come from! Since he had a reservation, we had the table for three hours and sampled many of their bar items! From squid in squid ink - which was tasty to pork belly (it wasn't for me but my boyfriend loved it), this was definitely a great experience. I truly loved the decor as it made me think that I had been transported elsewhere. This is a great place to go for a date or a girl's night out! The most memorable moment was that we had a sake sommeiler - you can also sit at the bar and enjoy the drinks as well but I'm not sure if that requires a reservation as well.
Jeff F.}Forest Hills, NY}11}50}0}-1}4}4/3/2009}I wouldn't clear out a spot in my regular rotation for this restaurant but it's definitely worth it to try once. Bring a date who can drink and try all of their delicious sake!Stand outs where the black sesame creme brulee and the beef tongue.  Their tofu is also incredibly fresh.  The cold soba was touted as being hand made but it didn't look or have the texture of being.  The custard with shrimp and pork was average.  Grilled uni was very good.
Bing S.}San Mateo, CA}83}102}0}-1}4}3/31/2009}Sakagura challenges my fear of basements and midtown.. Surpassing these hurdles, i was rewarded by a very stylized basement eatery replete with lots of wood and tasty 'whatisthises.'  i had a whatisthis monkfish liver thingy that looked like  pink carrot and tasted like a funny high end hot dog..  i also had a whatisthis tasty fried seafood and dip combo whatnot which was awesome.  the service was wonderful and i would totally come here again, especially to try out their extensive sake menu.
Adam E.}Astoria, NY}86}95}3}-1}5}3/28/2009}Sakagura is currently my favorite Japanese place in the city.  I wish I could remember more about the great food I had, but I went a little overboard on their fine selection of sake that night.  Next time I will have to take notes.
Sean S.}Manhattan, NY}743}1655}34}18}4}3/25/2009}This place is a super-duper special Japanese place.  Walk into a non-descript office building, and down a flight of stairs to a Japanese shangri-la... complete with plenty of izakaya style food, and a full menu of sake with page after page of options.  It's been a while since I've been here, but it is memorable, and worth going back.This place is perfect for a date.  It will impress all of your most jaded new york diners, as well as those with a particular Japanese taste.
Umi F.}New York, NY}17}56}4}-1}5}3/22/2009}The same people that own Decibal own this place. The walls are lined with different sakes and they have a multitude of menus dedicated to different tiers of sake (seasonal, exclusive, regular fare). Tonight we tried a carafe of Wataribune and Harushika (from the seasonal menu) and they were both refreshing and aromatic. DELICIOUS. Definitely try the Harushika sake from the spring sake specials, if you get the chance.That being said, when we came here last time, we got the karaage (fried chicken thighs) and they were large, chunky, and juicy. This time, we went for the shiromi nanban (white fish fried in a Japanese vinagarette marinade with sliced radishes, shiitake, etc..). Delicious and delicate tasting.My favorite appetizer is the hiyayakko (cold tofu with bonito flakes, ginger, and soy sauce). The grade of tofu was superb. The katsuoboshi was shaved in large chunks and was very flavorful.I couldn't NOT get the various sashimi donburis they had. I tried to hype myself up to get something else, but I kept thinking about the Sake Don and Sashimi Kimchee Don. My boyfriend claims that short of going to tsukiji market in Japan, this is the one place with the freshest ikura in town. Tonight, our dinner companion and I got the Sake Don and my boyfriend got the Sashimi Kimchee Don. Delicious. They line a mound of very lightly seasoned rice with thin slices of very fresh and fatty salmon and surround the thing in a pool of ikura. The Sashimi Kimchee Don features various sashimi pieces (last time I got engawa hirame - the hard end part that is DELICIOUS and quite coveted). This time my boyfriend had pieces of ika sashimi that melted in your mouth.Yeah. We go there for those donburi. We just can't go without them if we are there.For desert we got the black sesame creme brulee and the chocolate souffle. We broke the soufle and poured the raspberry puree in and it was DECADENT! The chocolate was warm, soft, gooey, and not that sweet. It was still VERY rich. The black sesame, though, was my favorite. It just has a very understated elegant taste. It is toasty and slightly sweet and just very satisfying.I am never disappointed when I come here. Get the sake! Get the donburis! Eat the black sesame creme brulee!For 2 appetizers, 3 donburis, 2 deserts, and 2 carafes of sake, the bill came out to $120. I would say that's reasonable for the sublime food you get. If you don't want to break the bank, don't get appetizers, get a glass/masu of delicious sake, and stick with the donburi. OR, go for their amazing lunch specials (and hand made soba). I think this week they are under $12.00. If I thought I could make it there and back in an hour, I would travel from work!
Vicky L.}Jersey City, NJ}783}903}409}18}4}3/20/2009}I ate so many things on this menu I'll have to upload pictures because I can't remember.  It was really good though and I like that even though it's not so secret anymore, it is still a secretive place.Get the Midnight Moon Sake.
Mindy Y.}New York, NY}1183}181}142}-1}4}3/15/2009}I just returned to Sakagura after a 2 year hiatus and I'm happy to say that I still like it. The food is intricate and unique... different than most Japanese restaurants in the city. The sake menu is ridiculously extensive, it can be very difficult to navigate through.Sakagura can be very pricey so unless you still run around with your corporate card, I do not recommend Sakagura for a big meal. Rather, it's a great place to experience different sakes and taste authentic tapas-style dishes.p.s. I love it that they are located in a very boring commercial building and you literally "discover" a world of sake. The ambiance is warm and their ladies' room is indeed super clean.
Norman S.}New York, NY}78}484}0}-1}2}3/14/2009}what is all the hype about?  i am really baffled!!!  i knew i was in for a rough night when we walked down to the substation of this office building and it faintly smelled like a bathroom.only a couple of things this place is worthy of mention.  if you don't want to spend 600 bucks on a full bottle of daishichi to try the most expensive sake in the world then you can order a taster size here - unfortunately it was not worth it, overly hyped and explains why this sake is only popular outside of japan.  the onigiri topped with saba was the only dish that was worthy of 5 stars.  everything else was just a huge disappointment.the pork belly was worthy of 3 stars it was way tougher than i am use too.  the hanger steak cooked on a hot stone was ok too but i could do the same at home.  the steak was nothing special and it wasn't even marinated.  the umiboshi was probably pickled not more than a week and was slightly too sweet.the duck was dry and quite bland.  tuna tartar was grizzly.  the grilled clams were gritty - come on even i know you are suppose to soak clams in a huge bucket of water for at least 24 hours so they will spit out the sand, before you even attempt to cook them.they focus too much on food presentation but even at that there really ios no art to it and it just doesn't deliver to the palate.  if you want great presentation AND taste go to aki on west 4th.I will never come back here again.  time is too short to be wasted on a poser place.
Hank C.}Jersey City, NJ}1664}2641}222}18}4}3/11/2009}Okay, Sakagura is a Japanese Sake Club located in the basement of an office building. That much said, an elevator or stairs down will take you to a place filled with Japanese businessmen and traditional waitstaff.A suggestion from the waitress on a not too dry, not too sweet sake ended up selecting the wonderful Uragasumi JDG, and that was delightfully light and refreshing for the three of us at dinner that night. Hot towels at the beginning and a very attentive staff with water and cleaning the table, folding the towels and more.The kamo roast - cold duck with green onion slivers was tasty (6 pieces), as were the hot dumplings - yuba shumai - (3 pieces) in a thin skin and special soy sauce. The gindara yuan yak - cod in special soy sauce was heavenly, flaking away and melting in the mouth (2 pieces), and the agadashi tofu came with bowls and spoons - served very well (3 pieces) with bonito flakes up top.  The dengaku (miso) was eggplant, and had three different miso sauces (2 pieces each), and the natto with raw tuna (5 pieces) wasn't bad (although natto - fermented soy beans - is an acquired taste for most, and has really long sticky strings).The cold udon with mushrooms was a vinegary, cool treat, and the rice - sanma onigiri - wrapped in mackerel was tasty and filling.  Hot fried chicken - tori karaage - (5 pieces) was excellent. The chocolate souffle topped off a great meal along with a side of ice cream and raspberry gel topping.Much a place to drink, talk, and enjoy one's self, it is expensive, but certainly worth it to relax and enjoy the company and drink great sake. A hot cup of tea at the end to finish the night.Dishes come as they're prepared, and certainly you'll want a few (2 dishes) at least per person, and maybe one rice or noodle dish for every two. While expensive if you have sake, price are much more reasonable if you don't drink liquor.
Erin L.}La Puente, CA}62}388}29}-1}5}3/5/2009}This place is absolutely amazing. I came here for lunch special for chirashi don, but they ran out :( I was so sad. Instead I got a mixed shashimi with soba noodle set. Their raw fish is very fresh and probably the best I've tried so far. The fish comes out in room temperature, and they literally melts in your mouth. For desserts, the green tea ice cream and red bean manju are awesome too. It's just the right amount of sweetness and you can really taste green tea and red bean flavor. I'm definitely coming back early next time to eat their chirashi don!!!!
Joel S.}Washington, DC}9}159}9}-1}5}3/4/2009}Atmosphere nice, food sublime, cost more than reasonable.I especially loved the buta kakuni (stewed diced pork): melt-in-your-mouth delicious, every bite a pleasure, though not for those who shy away from fat.  The fried tofu was also wonderful, and for dessert the black sesame creme brulee was also really delicious.I will say that the monkfish liver was not quite as good as at Sushi Taro in DC.My friend and I had a carafe of unfiltered sake, about 7 dishes, and dessert, and the total was about $100 -- a New York bargain.
Yi J.}New York, NY}7}49}1}-1}5}3/2/2009}I've been here quite a few times with friends and coworkers.  They've never disappointed me!!The place is a bit hard to find, since it's located in the basement of an office building.  However, once you get inside, you feel being transported to Japan.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is simply great.Sakagura is not your typical NYC sushi place.  In fact, they don't do sushi or sashimi at all.  Instead, you can find a large variety of delicious Japanese hot dishes.  Their serving size resembles that of a tapa's place, allowing you to sample many items from the menu.  For appetizers, their Kamo Roast (Slices of Chilled Roasted Duck Wrapped Around Scallion Accented with Basil Sauce) is heavenly.  Their Seaweed Salad is distinctively different from that from other places, in terms of the seaweed used.  For hot dishes, I particularly like:Buta Kakuni (Stewed Diced Pork) - Just beware that it comes with a thick layer of fat.  I usually just pick out the lean parts, and leave the fat.Gindara Yuan Yaki (Grilled Fillets of Cod Fish Steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce) - A must-try item in my opinion.  The fish is well grilled, and simply melts in your mouth.  Gyuniku Ishi Yaki (beef filet cooked on hot stone) - This is a fun dish, as you get to cook your own meat on a stone.  Just remember to rub the stone with the piece of fat they provide you with first.  Otherwise you might have a hard time peeling off your beef.Now, I have a slight issue with their Onigiri (rice balls).  Not that they're not good, but usually when you get, say a Meitaiko Onigiri, the fish eggs are supposed to be inside the rice ball.  At Sakagura, all the fillings become toppings, i.e., they sit on top of your rice ball!!  You also need to wrap the seaweed around it on your own.  I still haven't figured out the best way to enjoy their Onigiri's, and end up making a mess every time.
Jaime D.}New York, NY}13}75}23}-1}4}2/23/2009}I went there for lunch with three other people and right away we were seated. At first approach, the entrance looks deceiving because it's an office building but you have to just walk through the lobby and pass the security desk to the entrance right next to them. The minute you begin to descend the staircase you know you are approaching a Japanese restaurant because of the smell of raw fish. The ambiance was peaceful and no boisterous crowds. The service was very polite and no pretentiousness. I ordered the Sake itura Don which is salmon sashimi & Salmon roe on sushi rice with a full size of soba noodles on the side. The portions for the noodles and the rice are very much acceptable for the high lunch price of $16.50, however the quality is worth it. It was a special occasion for myself and my lunch mates so we were ok with the price. The rice bowl had a sprinkle of salmon roe and the black seaweed and there were three slices - yes I repeat 3 small slices of very fresh salmon sashimi. Although the fish provided was meager, you can't but help savor what you have received and that's what I noticed the whole table did because we ordered the same dish. The broth and the soba were exceptional! I enjoyed the entire broth. Even the tea was well made. There are some places where they pass off boiled water and reused tea leaves for green tea, but this tea you can taste the leaf and it was quite good as well as I didn't have to ask for the waitress to fill my cup, they were there making sure our cups were filled. I gave the place and overall 4 star rating because the quality of the food was good, I felt full because I ate up all the rice and noodle and drank the broth up. At $16.50 for my lunch, it was pricey but worth the experience and I would do it again, not for an everyday occurrence but more for when we feel like treating ourselves after bringing lunch in all week.
Lisa Marie R.}New Rochelle, NY}21}22}0}-1}3}2/21/2009}I went here on a date and let the dude do the ordering, so I kind of feel like I would've liked this place a lot better if I got to pick the selections. Though my palette has come a long way from the chicken fingers days of my youth, some of the options like the sardine crackers and the monk fish liver were just a little too adventurous for my taste. Although I have to say the braised pork shoulders was one of the best things I ever had the fortunate happenstance to put in my mouth. (Insert dirty innuendo here). The free range chicken wasn't, in my humble opinion, worth its price. Also, I totally would have gotten lost had I tried to find this place on my own. Now that I know how to find it, I I'd likely go back and order for myself, thank you very much.
Madhuri S.}New York, NY}29}54}0}-1}5}2/19/2009}Just fabulous. One of my favorite places to eat in the city. And yes I'm definitely enough of a dork to still love the idea of walking into that dry office building and down that dingy stairwell to find this place. I always get the eggplant three ways and the black sesame creme brulee. From the rest of the small plates I've tried the only one I didn't like was the tori karage, not my favorite style of fried chicken. I never really met a sake I didn't like, but if you are lost with the plethora of choices the staff are knowledgeable and extremely helpful.Its a great date place but could also be perfect for business dinners. Hello expense account.If you are freaking out about the prices, my suggestion is to make a few trips out there for drinks and small eats. It only gets expensive when you try to fill your empty starving stomach with the tiny portions.
Kiki D.}Hoboken, NJ}5}35}0}-1}5}2/17/2009}My boyfriend and I enjoy trying new restaurants as often as possible and what a great choice this was!  Although you may not see the restaurant from the street I think that adds to the excitement.  Walking down the stairs we found ourselves in Japan.  We were seated immediately and were greeted by our great waitor.  He was able to help us pick out a sake for the evening which was a Shizuku-Zake (the presentation alone was beautiful).  Our meal included: GYU MISO NIKOMI (shredded beef back ribs in a miso stew that was divine, EBI SHINJO(deep fried shrimp balls covered in almonds which were crisp and delicious), YUBA SHUMAI  (pork dumplings), and last but certainly not least...INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA (noodles that were absolute perfection). To end the meal we had the chocolate soufflé which was also fabulous!  Overall, this place for the hour or so that we spent there took us out of Manhattan and let us experience true Japanese cuisine.
Judith C.}Philadelphia, PA}8}66}0}-1}5}2/17/2009}Very fun and tasty. It would be worth dragging a group of friends up to midtown to go here for drinks and nibblies. They will like it and you will have fun.
Janet S.}San Francisco, CA}50}278}112}-1}4}2/11/2009}The fried tofu in broth... first of all.. was the best I have ever had... it was so smooth and warm.   just for that i would have given it 4 stars.  We also got the grilled eggplant... deeelliciiouussss..  it comes with three miso sauces each different, each i have never had before.  trust me... its wroth it at $12... get it.I think they only thing i thought was weird was when we asked the waitress what was the difference between one sake and the other in our sake tasting flight.. she couldnt really explain.  She just kept saying one was premium and the other one is not... we kept asking, well what makes it a premium... she couldnt answer.  Oh well.  tasted good tho.
Chad M.}Jersey City, NJ}13}93}3}-1}5}2/6/2009}I try to be sparing with my 5 star reviews, lest they lose their special meaning. After my 2 dinner experiences here I'd say it's a solid 4-4.5. However, recently my friend and I went here twice in a week for lunch, and there's no doubt that it deserves a 5 star when that is factored in. Literally the best lunch deal in NYC. You have to get there before 1:00 to have a decent shot at it. Each day they make 30 sets of homemade soba (they don't skimp on the portions) and a donburi of some kind (varies by day of the week). The first time we went the donburi was Bara Chirashi Don...again not a small portion at all. What makes this the best lunch deal in NYC is that their sushi rice is OUTSTANDING (in my top 5), their homemade soba noodles are better than Soba Nippon, and comparable to Onigashima. The absolute kicker is that this lunch set is only $11. That's right, for the price of either one at any other restaurant, you get both here, of superior quality. I'm so sad that we are back down in the financial district for work now and can't do this daily. Last word of advice, even though plenty of people have already said it...I'll reiterate, try the black sesame creme brulee and the green tea truffles! Water Refill Meter: 4/5 Generally it's refilled before completely empty, but sometimes I have to ask. Very rarely it's a little hard to get a server's attention.
Irene H.}Middle Village, NY}135}205}0}-1}4}1/31/2009}The infamous Sakagura.  How this place eluded me for so long, I will never figure out... after all, it's hidden in the basement of a corporate building on an inconspicuous street in Midtown behind a few closed doors.  So, I finally made way to this underground sake bar that I've been dying to go to for quite some time.  In fact, we celebrated my birthday here not too long ago and I can't rave enough about it.  I had requested a hole in the wall restaurant and I literally received a square.  We were seated in the back within a square sectional.  One steps into a sterile building, makes there way down a flight of typical stairs and behind two wooden doors lays this bar/restaurant that produces some of the finest sake bottles and Japanese bar food known to .. Midtown.We began the evening asking for sake recommendations and the waitress brought out her two favorite bottles.  I liked both.Unfortunately, I misunderstood the waitress and thought she said the bottle of sake was $29 when in fact, that was for just a box.  We wound up ordering the bottle and I'm sure the bottle was a weeeee bit more expensive than just the box.  You are getting more after all.  Thank you friend! and very very sorry ... um yes sorry.So while I will rave about the sake itself (smooth, flagrant, nice finish), I won't rave about the lost in translation prices.  Please make sure you are asking for the price of what you would like to order.  I thought I had that down pat many years ago too.As for the food, most of it was delicious.  The seaweed wrapped rice balls was probably my favorite dish.  The age tofu was silky and very clear in flavor.  The pork and beef special combined flavors that are unique and hardly seen in your typical Japanese restaurant...The best part was the company received in a place I've been wanting to dine at for ages.  That, and the awesome restroom!  They have the techy toilets that you have to figure out how to use.  I stayed in there for a good amount of time trying to figure out how to flush.  Where else can you get that experience??!
ryan c.}Long Island City, NY}13}42}0}-1}4}1/11/2009}The place was easy to find but in an odd location (not a bad thing at all)  It's a few blocks from Grand Central so it's easy for people in Westchester to get to if you want good, authentic Japanese food.  I sat at the sake bar and I'm not that familiar with sake nor am I a tourist but I asked the bartender definitely favored pointing out the most expensive bottles of sake.  I had the Masakura sake which was very good.  I also had Maguro Tartar which was very very good.  The complimentary tea at the end of the night was nice too.
Dennis C.}Los Angeles, CA}107}93}8}-1}4}1/4/2009}I saw this restaurant on Yelp and heard about it from friends, as a visitor from LA.  So you have to remember, this is a LA perspective -- a place where often times you have to trade off great food with bad service/ambiance and vice versa (I'm not hating, just stating my opinion).  One of the best aspects of New York that I absolutely love was... its genuineness.  In this over-crowded, word-of-mouth, ultra-critical (again, not hating), restaurant environment in Manhattan, hype is not a word or concept that is uttered.  So many of the restaurants had great good, service and ambiance.  And to me, Sakagura was a standout in all categories.  The wait staff was attentive at replacing the flatware, replenishing the water, delivering the food in a timely manner (as we finished each dish), and recommending the myriad of sakes in their collection.  The place was dimly lit, with just enough lighting to pass for a casual dining establishment, but intimate enough for a date.  And the food!  Expertly prepared, as close to the subtle mastery you'd find in Japan as you'd expect to find here thousands of miles away.  Fried foods were delicately battered and perfectly fried.  Most of the sauces were flavorful, but still retained their subtle flavors.  I won't repeat what others have said here, but some of the more memorable dishes for me were:  *  Uni, crab over sushi rice--Probably my favorite dish.  It was surprising to eat the slightly cooked uni -- almost like crab roe but the combination of the three was awesome* Jellyfish with persimmons and cucumber -- very subtle miso, sesame flavors (however, not enough jellyfish for my Chinese taste);   Uber yummy, but expensive at $28 for a small bowl (it was actually served on a small crab shell).*  Stewed pork -- very fatty, but very well steamed and seasoned.  *  Sake -- well, you can order about any type, from the unfiltered to the ultra filtered, sweet or dry, etc.  By far one of the best aspects of the restaurant, but a bit pricey.  So some people complain about the service -- yes, overall throughout dinner it was excellent.  But then it took 1/2 hr to get the check, because non of the wait staff came by.  To their defense, it was towards the end of the night and most of the patrons were gone, but still....
kevin w.}San Francisco, CA}9}13}0}-1}2}1/1/2009}food is gorgeously presented, but not actually that tasty.  and our waitress was kinda clueless and we had to wait FOREVER for some of our food.
Linda W.}New York, NY}36}369}49}-1}4}12/31/2008}I really do like Sakagura.  I can't give it 5 stars; though the food was beautifully presented, there were a couple of dishes which were just off.This restaurant is in the basement of an office building.  I know everyone talks about how its a hidden gem, but its really just a restaurant.  Decoration isn't bad, but nothing super special.  What I found most interesting was the bathroom.  They are in these circular rooms, the door is part of the half circle and bamboo.  But that's not all - the women's bathroom has one of those japanese everything toilets.  That means you can do anything humanly possible while on the toilet, heat the seat, spray you butt, wash your front - whatever you can think of, you can do in this bathroom.Ok, enough of this.  I know the bathroom isn't the highlight of the restaurant, but it was pretty good.I have to say, i know they have an extensive sake menu, but we decided to forgo that and try more of their dishes.Menu items:- MAGURO YAMAKAKE : Fresh Tuna Sashimi Served with Grated Mountain Yam - do not get this unless you like mushiness.  Maybe I just don't know my mountain yams, but this was by far the worst dish- FLUKE CARPACCIO : Thinly Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf - very good, but portion size was tiny- MAGURO TARTAR : Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar - this was heaven.  I've eaten a lot of tartar this week, and this by far the best.  Presentation was spot on, and taste was fabulous- JAGA DANGO : Mashed Potatoes Coated in Sweet Donut Batter Fried Crisp  - interesting preparation of potatoes.  I am not a fan of potatoes, but this was fried on the outside like a lighter corn dog shell, and the inside tasted like, hm, what is the right taste, ok, I'm going with rice, mashed rice- AMADAI SAIKYO YAKI : Grilled Fillets of Tile Fish Steeped in " SAIKYO " Miso - not great, the fish was old so taste was not the best- SURUMEIKA YAKI : Grilled Japanese Squid Brushed with Garlic Soy Sauce - so salty I had to squeeze 4 lemons on it, and pretty much was the the squid with the lemon juice- HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA " : Cold Plain Buckwheat Noodle Served with Bonito Infused Soy Dipping Sauce - i never know soba could be so good- INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA : HOT-with Spinach Cold with / Choice of Topping - The worst of the main entrees- SAKE OYAKO DON : Fillets of Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe Steeped in Soy Sauce Served Atop a bowl of Rice [Served with Miso Soup] - Yum, this was the best of the entrees.  I really enjoyed the salmon, so fresh, and just beautifully presented- KAISEN KIM-CHEE DON : Assorted Chopped Sashimi Mixed with Kimchee over Rice [Served with Miso Soup] - Par, fish was fresh, nothing innovativeI have to say, I am not a dessert person, but its worth getting the homemade truffles.  We got an order, and they were nice enough to give us one of each: sesame, strawberry, and green tea.  These were so delicious i ordered some the next week to gift.  They put 4 in a cute little box, or 10 in a bamboo wood thing.  This place is definitely pricey, and i didn't even feel the full brunt of the cost since we didn't try any of the sakes.  If you are planning to come here, make sure you're wallet is fat cause you'll leave with it pretty thin.Note on the service - generally pretty good, though I wish the waiter would have spoken just a little more english.Overall, a good experience.  Much happier leaving here than i was earlier in the week from Blue Water Grill.
Michael K.}Los Angeles, CA}31}19}0}-1}4}12/30/2008}Great food, great service (even without a reservation!) and very extensive sake selection.  A stranger to most fine eats in the city, I yelped a good Japanese restaurant and coincidentally the restaurant was located two blocks from my hotel.  Had a great dining experience, but can't remember much (due to the massive amounts of alcohol).  Unlike some of the restaurants I've been dining at, I walked out with a grin on my face.  Friendly staff and good atmosphere is all I need, cuz in reality, how bad can Japanese food be?
George T.}Los Angeles, CA}281}319}658}18}4}12/27/2008}[-1 Star because service was wayyyyy off.  I hate holiday seasons when the regular staff is gone.]I admire greatly people who know what the hell they are talking about, but who don't feel the need to remind you of that every 5 minutes.  This leaves time to talk about other things, which of course includes more "airtime" for me.       MeMeMeMeMe!  Competency is critical for Japanese cuisine, and having an expert there saves ME the embarrassment of asking, when confronted by a statement from the server as: "We have fresh tako tonight." with questions like: "Are they two for 99 cents?" or "Oh, do you have lengua?"  Hey, what do you want?  I was raised as a SoCal kid who likes tongue...Luckily, I had such an expert on Japanese cuisine with me.  Knowing he's modest and not one to seek attention, I'll save the laudatory praises for another review.I love the cuisine here, despite complaints people have about cost.  Everything was fresh, deftly prepared and accompanied by just the right amount of seasoning.  Japanese cuisine is all about subtlety, and people who complain about how little flavor their food has should probably stop eating poo and let their taste buds grow back.  Seriously, put less salt on your food and give it a week or two.What we had (if you hate long reviews, just order the stuff marked with "*" when you take me):*ONSEN TAMAGO : Soft Boiled Egg Topped with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe in Cold Soup - $9.00.  Duuuude, I dub this the "surf & turf" dish on account of the chicken egg and salmon roe combination.  The uni was exquisite; truly the best I've ever had and even--dare I say it--better than Yoshi's, which was the first place I acquired a taste for uni ( yelp.com/biz/yoshis-sush… ).  Well, let's just say you never forget your first, but I'd highly recommend this if you're not put off by any of the various ingredients.  IKA SHIOKARA: Sliced Raw Squid Cured in Salt and Squid Liver Marinade - $5.50.  There was a "pop" from the liver marinade, but it could be too pungent for inexperienced eaters--kind of like when you first eat raw fish of the female variety.  My advice is to down a couple of shots of sake and then you and your squid will both be relaxed enough to enjoy it.*FLUKE CARPACCIO: Thinly Sliced Fluke Sashimi Drizzled with Olive Oil and Topped with Plum Paste, Salmon Roe and Shiso Leaf - $10.00.  Me so in love with shiso.  This was not outstanding, but very good.  I will say that, like a good employee (but one who's not really necessary to the bottom line), this would be the last one I would cut if I were only to order HALF of the menu.*SATOIMO IRIDASHI: Taro Potato, Eggplant and Shiitake Mushrooms Fried in a Light Batter served Broth - $8.50.  I'm Taiwanese and all about taro.  This was some goood root.*JAGA DANGO: Mashed Potatoes Coated and Fried in Donut Batter - $6.00.  The best way to describe this is to replay my stream of consciousness as I bit into it: "Hmm, there's a subtle sweetness that is definitelOMGISTHATMOCHIINTHEMIDDLE?!?"  I'd imagine there's a Japanese version of Homer Simpson walking around in Japan somewhere, popping these babies into his mouth.  I'd rate this a "Woo-hoo!" and a "must order."*MAGURO TARTAR: Chopped Tuna with Frying Fish Roe Steeped in Yuzu and Caviar - $15.00.  What can I say?  A good tuna preparation is hard to find.SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU: Grilled Japanese Eggplants with Three Kinds of Miso (Egg Yolk, Spinach, and Sweet Red) - $12.00.  Eggplant is yummy, but I was starting to be full and didn't try this.*WAGIYU ISHIKAYA: Wagiyu Beef Cooked Over Hot Stone - .  This was definitely a highlight of the meal, and I only wish I could have cooked the beef.  However, after the last time I almost set the house on fire by trying to fry a turkey, I've learned to let the pros do it.TORI TSUKUNE: Chicken Meat Balls with Teriyaki Sauce - $6.00.  The only "meh" part of the meal, probably because I don't like balls.CHAWANMUSHI: Steamed Egg Custard Served with Chicken, Shrimp and Gingko Nuts Topped with a thickened Ponzu Sauce - $9.00.  My parents really love chawanmushi, and I'd love to be able to take them here to try this.*HOMEMADE "NIHACHI SOBA ": Cold Plain Buckwheat Noodle Served with Bonito Infused Soy Dipping Sauce - $12.00.  Great, solid soba that had a significant bounce--just like your GF's fake boobs.  I would order this at the beginning of the meal next time so I'm still hungry enough to eat it.  ALL OF IT.INANIWA" UDON NOODLE from AKITA: Hot broth with Spinach - $11.00.  I'm not normally a fan of udon, but this was a thinner version and very special.We didn't have the dessert here as we moved on to venue 2, Cha-An.As you will gleam from other reviews, this is a serious date place; out of the way and no cell phone reception.  If you make it to date 4+, it's a good bet you'll end up taking me here.
Carol S.}Los Angeles, CA}303}296}94}-1}1}12/26/2008}Umm... Not really a fan. Nothing was impressive, from the really expensive menu to the forgetful waiter. Everyone is really nice, that's for sure... but as for a restaurant, it did not wow me the tiniest bit. I'm sure it doesn't help that I'm not a heavy drinker and wasn't really there for the sake.I ordered their special shredded pork dish that was OK, some mashed potato donut fried thing that ended up tasting like nothing (I was expecting sweet!) and then these fried shrimp rolls that was just OK. We also got their dessert, chocolate souffle and creme brulee... it was just OK. I don't know why everyone keeps talking about their great desserts and special dishes. Have they really never been to better places than this?The waiter KEPT forgetting some dishes and our drinks. (I asked for my diet coke 3x) and the food came out verrry slowly.Even though I tried my best to keep the costs low by only ordering 3 small dishes, everyone still paid $45 per person.  You could eat a steak dinner at Houstons for that amount! I didn't drink but ended up still paying over $30. Sorry, but never again.
joe z.}San Francisco, CA}0}55}0}-1}2}12/23/2008}Other than the drinks I can't fathom why someone would venture across the street from Yasuda to this place.  The service is average at best (took our drinks without asking if we wanted refills), the food comes out slow (an hour for two appetizers and two mains that weren't much larger than the appetizers?), the menu is average in taste and presentation, and if not for the sake and beer I can't imagine I'd eve feel this good...I'm still bummed I didn't eat up stairs at the udon place and thank god I did eat across the street at Yasuda's to get the taste of Sakagura's out of my mouth.
Alison C.}Hoboken, NJ}1023}1360}529}18}4}12/22/2008}With all of the press Sakagura has received since its debut, you would expect it to be easier to locate.  However, this gem truly is hidden, first within an office building and then even further down in the depths of the basement.  The environment does feel a bit claustrophobic at times, but the dark cherrywood decor give it a real traditional flavor.  On weekday evenings, this Japanese hot spot is full of business diners and professional foodies there to sample the tasty tapas-style cuisine and massive sake menu.  Sakagura's sake selection really put them on the radar of chefs like Anthony Bourdain, who visited the underground lair in his Manhaatan No Reservations episode.  There are 3 separate sake menus, including specialties and recommendations.  Each version is available in 4 different sizes, ranging from cup to bottle.  Also, the menu contains detailed descriptions of each, so you know what flavor undertones to look forward to.The large culinary menu offers a similarly overwhelming variety of options.  It is best to order a bunch of dishes for the table to share.  Most courses are priced between $5-15, which is not bad but tends to add up quickly.  The Fluke Carpaccio was thinly sliced fresh fluke topped with fresh salmon roe.  The bland fish really got kicked into high gear with the large salmon roe poured on top of it.  The plum sauce and flavorful shiso leaves added a sweet and earthy flavor.  The Maguro Yamakake was an odd-looking bowl of tuna sashimi chunks drowning in a sea of "grated mountain yam".  I put quotes around the yam because I would not refer to this creamy, chunky mixture as "grated".  The Kamo Roast consisted of tender slices of roasted duck loosely encasing a bushel of scallion strands.  A basil sauce was a terrific flavor enhancer.  We also enjoyed the Satoimo Iridashi, which was essentially an Asian vegetable tempura of taro, eggplant, and shiitake mushrooms.  The sweet Ebi Shinjo deep-fried shrimp balls were dressed with toasted almonds.  I loved biting into the crisp puffs and discovering the moist shrimp bits inside.  Lastly, the Miso Yakionigiri were large grilled rice balls topped with an out-of-this-world rich miso paste.  Though the balls were unfilled, the thin layer of miso paste added more than enough flavor to compliment the rice.Sakagura is a destination for true, adventurous Japanese fanatics.  They do not offer your standard California roll, or any sushi rolls for that matter.  Come here to be dazzled and enjoy a new experience.
Yosh H.}New York, NY}246}399}77}-1}4}12/21/2008}Over priced, over priced, over priced.  But the beer I got with dinner was good, good, good.  It's a hard to find restaurant that reminds me of dinners in asia.  The walk through the lobby of an office building, the service stairs, the small, dim hallways.  And then, you arrive at the restaurant.  I tried the specials (pork belly in broth, mixed mushroom salad, etc.) while my friend tried a few of the staples.  The green tea truffles are impressive,  Actually, the green tea truffles were amazing.
Ishmael V.}Brooklyn, NY}222}226}34}-1}4}12/18/2008}the tori karage gave me a little stomachache, but maybe its becuase ive been eating popeyes for a long time, and my weak american stomach cant handle good fried chicken. DAMN YOU AMERICAN BELLY!the fluke carpaccio and fried persimmon were pretty amazing. especially the persimmon with plum miso paste. i do regret not getting the nabe, but maybe nexttime.also i had shochu instead of sake, because i perfer shochu. no offense, but maybe nexttime.theres nothing else that hasnt been said about this little gem in the corporate building (and no its not enron or merrill lynch).
Gee P.}Sunnyside, NY}31}56}12}-1}4}12/17/2008}A slick sake bar that's somewhat hidden in the basement of what looks like a office building in midtown.Very nice ambiance and fantastic service! The service was only beaten by the awesome sake selection!I shared the flights of sake with my friend over some small plates that were delish! More exclamations!!!
Karen H.}Atlanta, GA}20}172}0}-1}4}12/17/2008}Cool vibe, amazing sake selection - yes, the food menu has about 30 items, while the sake menu has about 300. The food is eclectic and adventuresome, so if you're going for a tuna roll, you're out of luck. Open your mind to something new, and you're in luck. I sat at the bar and asked for suggestions for both food and sake, and wasn't disappointed.
Ishtar Y.}Los Angeles, CA}0}235}23}-1}2}12/16/2008}what????? was i missing something????grr...... the food was just... underwhelming.........maybe if had been drunk on sake everything would've tasted better and tripled in portion... but yea everyone at my table was completely sober.  maybe because im spoiled by all the hole in the wall izakaya places in WestLa that this place didnt impress me. the only difference between here and other izakayas that i tried was that the waitresses here were all very confused at everything we said, the portions were way smaller and way more expensive, and the everything had bonito flakes speckled all over them ( the ones you get in a huge bag for a dollar)  .for the Newyorkers at the table... well i guess they have nothing to compare Sakagura to, so they were very satisfied with the food. however all the LA people were saying how it sucked.and how were were still hungry...... haha..it was good i admit... but not GREAT..... seriously.. ive had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better.the thing i found uber was the japanese toiletrooms. that was kick ass. well not 'kick' ass... more like.... hahaha.....anyway... is this all NY has to offer for izakaya????? they didnt even have shisamo!!!!!! HOW is that possible????? grrr......boooo.......................BOOO booo BOOOOOOO....
P W.}Long Island City, NY}3}39}0}-1}5}12/15/2008}Oh man, this is the place. Been going here for a bunch of years now and I never get tired of it. The food is excellent and I love the vibe. Service is very precise. Everyone I've brought here loves it. Real Japanese with one hell of a Sake list.
Alan A.}Chino Hills, CA}60}26}4}-1}4}12/13/2008}Sake selection is very robust, they give you three menus of their sake collection. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a sake drinker. But besides that, had a wonderful dinner here. I recommend the grilled eel and the tuna tartar. For the main course, we selected the "fillets of beef", a chef's selection for that day. Slices of beef served with a heating stone to cook it on. A novel idea, but by the time we were trying to grill the last couple of pieces, the stone just didn't have enough steam. Oh well, I appreciated the effort. For dessert, definitely can't go wrong with the Black Sesame Creme Brulee.
Eric K.}Costa Mesa, CA}200}155}1}-1}4}12/12/2008}Extensive sake selection!  Try the sake tasting so you can really compare the quality of super-premiums.  I love this concept of Japanese cooked dishes, and I've tried pretty much everything on the menu.  I have to say though, I thought Aburiya Kinnosuke had better food.  For sake, this place is hands down one of the best spots in the city.  But the selection of hamachi in Aburiya gives them the nod.
John A.}Seattle, WA}46}23}1}-1}4}12/10/2008}Sakagura is an excellent, clean sake bar - izakaya, if you want to call it that.  We sat at the bar, which is pretty good for two people - though the bartender was less than awesome in terms of his sake knowledge/help.  I'm a big fan of nigori sake - cloudy, unfiltered - but the choices weren't that varied.  The special nigori sake was sold out.Huge plus is that they serve Yebisu beer, which deserves a half star in itself.Tomago Yaki (eel wrapped sweet egg omelet)  - love this stuff - 4 pieces for 8 bucks is kind of ridiculous (a theme we'll see more of)Uzaku (eel, seaweed, cucumber salad tower) - awesome dish, my favorite could've eaten an entire one by myselfSurumeika Yaki (grilled squid) - good, but nothing to write home about - and smallTori Karaage (fried chicken) - because come one, who the hell passes up a change at fried chicken?   good stuff, but a little bit on the oily side, and literally took 40 minutes to arrive.Fluke Carpaccio - I tend to shy away from the carpaccio's at Japanese joints, but I usually can't resist the flavor shiso (was supposed to have shiso leaf) - shiso salad dressing could be better than fried chicken...maybe.Don't think you can go wrong with the food, sake is a given, and Yebisu beer is a frigg'n home run - but the price points are about 25% too high.  Walking out after 2.5 beers a piece, a carafe of fairly low end sake, and the dishes above with a bill of $130 (with tip) seemed a little pricey.
Sabrina L.}New York, NY}165}61}141}-1}5}12/7/2008}great sake, great fat pig stew, great basically everythingI ordered TWO dessert... everytime i go there.. actually, i save alil more space for their dessert...Oh, im drooling
Ford S.}Manhattan, New York, NY}0}37}0}-1}4}12/6/2008}One of my favorite izakaya in New York.  Authentic atmosphere, service, cozy and warm feel, and the fact that it's tucked in the middle of nowhere beneath a cold office building gives it a sense of magic, as if you've discovered some secret hidden place beneath the city.  The food is superb, the sake collection delicious.  My only gripe is with the price, as this is really an expensive place relative to other izakaya, either in NY or Japan.  But thumbs up all around.
Ryan C.}San Mateo, CA}35}102}2}-1}5}12/4/2008}Best Japanese Onigiri (get the spicy fish egg one, I think) and lots of different types of sake.
Chris S.}Flushing, NY}52}54}1}-1}5}12/2/2008}I recently ate here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. Where do I begin? I loved this place! This place is a Sake bar and they serve pretty much side dishes to along with their amazing sake selection. The side dishes are amazing. They are beautifully presented and they are super delicious. We ordered the almond crusted shrimp balls. Best shrimp balls I have ever had. We ordered a Junmai Ginjo sake from Nagano province. It was delightful. We also ordered a tempura-style Anago(thats saltwater eel). Amazing! That was a little pricey at $20 tho. We also had a miso-based shoju brushed ika. Very good. Also, a sweet basted cod fillet. Delicious. Finally, Natto-Maguro sashimi. I'm a white boy who loves Natto! We also had desert which was a buckwheat bun filled with asuki beans accompanied by some green tea sorbet. Everything was delicious and the place was authentic Japanese. The restaurant is beautifully decorated without being pretentious. I felt as if I was in Tokyo! Big recommendation on this one!  Oh, I forgot.  I found out about this place on no other than YELP!!
Stella Y.}Atlanta, GA}127}364}277}-1}5}11/25/2008}Gosh--what a hidden gem for real! This is my new favorite "local joint". I love their eclectic menu, proclivity for bringing together unique ingredients for a powerful (or perfectly understated) dish, and the care with which they prepare your food. The food and experience are both truly unique at Sakagura.Their sake selection is also extensive. I recommend sitting at the bar (the left side/closer to the entrance) for a great dining experience. You'll be able to see all the action, ie: the pastry chefs preparing each order of dessert with utter finesse and expertise, and you'll also experience the attentiveness of the waitress who will pour every few turns or so of sake into your glass.The space is also beautifully decorated--dining at Sakagura makes you feel like you're somewhere very far from the city and it's a great way to block out the rest of the world for an hour or so.I can't say enough about this place and all the wonderfully creative, delicious and fresh food they have to offer. Just go and find out for yourself!
Renee M.}New York, NY}126}340}18}-1}5}11/20/2008}Ok No Joke!!!! This place is the BEST BEST BEST Sake you will ever drink! BEST BEST Uni soup you will ever have!!!!although the uni soup could have been served warm not chilled....But still fantastico!!!!So went here for Xmas dinner last year with my best friend and her fam....about 8 of us!We had the blue bottle sake i'm sorry dunno what its called but it runs about $200 per bottle...I know i know really steep...but seriously soo soo soo worth it!!!! Never will you taste sake soo light, so refreshing...so utterly orgasmic!!!! want an orgasm from Sake go here!!!The UNI soup is chunks of uni in all it's glory with a perfectly poached egg sitting in a broth of miso seaweed and what tastes like ginger sesame soy a sauce....sooo ridiculously good....I never liked UNI until I had uni here!!!We also had a sashimi sampling: yellow tail, tuna, white tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, white fish, toro, octopus, ami ebi, tamago, various fish roes....all fresh and super delish!!!!!Ok heres the thing about this place; its inside the basement of some school! so if you aren't in the know about this place you shall never find or know about it....typically reservations are necessary...cuz it gets packed like a sardine can real easy!in the end ladies and gents:  Go here for Food ORGASMS!!!!!
LC W.}New York, NY}8}42}0}-1}4}11/19/2008}Food?  Ok.  Sake?  Second to none.  If you haven't been before, it is a trip going into the basement late at night.  The whole ambiance really makes it fun.  It is best after dinner elsewhere in the area and then head here for drinks.
Seong P.}San Francisco, CA}490}1525}0}-1}4}11/17/2008}The location in the basement of an office building was interesting.  You'd never know what the interior was liked based purely on the exterior and that's usually a bonus for me.  It was much bigger than I expected with a back room that would be good for larger parties.  We started with flights of sake based on Jen D.'s recommendation (thanks, yo) and that put us in a good mood.  We tried a number of things but my favorites were the cube steak, fried monkfish and liver, fluke sashimi with roe and shiso and black sesame creme brulee.  Service was fine but it just wasn't the same without the SF hoodlums I usually end up at izakayas with.  When did I get so sentimental (don't answer that, chubi)?
R H.}San Francisco, CA}1}93}6}-1}5}11/16/2008}A great place to relax with some excellent food and drink. The place is a little hard to find, but definitely worth a search because of the great selection of food and sake. We ordered a plethora of dishes, but my favorites were the steak on the hot stone and the pork in the broth. Mmmm... yummy. I also liked the bathroom... I would never have figured it out if not for seeing someone walking out of it. Nice touch. One last suggestion - please remember to make reservations over the phone. The forward-thinker I am, I called to make a quick reservation before we all showed up for dinner at 8pm. By the time we arrived, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table to clear. Otherwise, we would have to wait with the others for over 45 minutes for a table for four.
Diane A.}Manhattan, NY}30}145}0}-1}4}11/15/2008Updatedreview}I still don't know much about sake and this is still a favorite for my out of town visitors (see my previous rating).  The only reason I'm docking a star is because I'm rescaling my ratings to reduce star-inflation.  That said, Sakagura continues to capture my imagination but the food is not outstanding enough to retain 5-stars in my revised system.Be sure to try the steak on a stone (you cook steak pieces on a hot stone) and eggplant with miso.
Bradley B.}NY, NY}1}10}0}-1}3}11/14/2008}This place is great.  Just finding it was an adventure all in itself.  At first, I thought I was heading into a grimy place but when opening the door into the restaurant I was extremely surprised.The decor is great.  Besides all the wood there is a big paper mache person hanging from the ceiling in the back which is fun.  There are plenty of tables so reservations are not required but are a good idea because they are popular.  The food was just ok.  I had asked out waitress to bring over some traditional japanese food but all we got was some blue fin tuna and a few fish balls.  Don't get me wrong, they were decent but I was hoping for something a little more adventurous.  The desserts were just ok.  HOWEVER, the saki is another story...Their menu is out of this world and they are very helpful with taste and drinkability.  Before coming here I had never thought of drinking saki like you do wine but with the quality they have here you don't drop this stuff in your beer or shoot it down.  We ended up getting one of their moderately priced bottles ($80) but it was great.  750 ml bottle.  After we finished this, we asked for something a little stronger.  My friend had turned my onto Sho-Chu which is a type Japanese vodka.  It was delicious.  By the time we had to go, I was seeing double but I was extremely happy with my experience there.Just as a precation, bring the address and follow the directions all the way down into the dungeon.
See M.}NY, NY}2}42}0}-1}3}11/10/2008}I would have never known about Sakagura if a friend hadn't taken us there to try.  I've walked by the building many times and didn't even know there was a cool little Japanese restaurant in the basement.  Food was good but it wasn't as great as my experience at Aburiya Kinnosuke just a couple of blocks away.  They do have a great sake selection and great service.  There's no cell phone reception in the basement so get ready for some good old fashioned face to face conversations.
Lisa C.}San Francisco, CA}23}198}6}-1}5}11/5/2008}A great hidden gem! I was expecting a dark, dreary place but low and behold it was like I was in Japan.We came to have drinks. The sake was so smooth and tasted even better with the homemade dessert. The chocolate souffle with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream is what I ordered - yum. I'd definitely go back to try lunch or dinner.The decor and atmosphere was fun yet had a homey feeling. Wonderful service.
Miss Y.}San Jose, CA}27}115}46}-1}4}11/2/2008}My favorite is their assorted sashimi.  All so fresh and everything is edible, even those purple flowers!  This dish somehow reminds me of another delicate sashimi dish I had in Kaygetsu, Menlo Park, CA.  We loved it so much and we ordered two.  We actually didn't get to finish the uni in the second platter.  What a waste!!  This place has great combination of sashimi and grill food selections.  Unless you do some research ahead of time or go with a new yorker, there is no way you can find this place.  It is in a basement of an office building mid town.  You also need to reserve couple days earlier to ensure availability...  overall, i love the ambiance, the food, oh, did I mention about their barrel designed restrooms?  Pretty cool!
Elena V.}New York, NY}104}191}232}-1}3}10/30/2008}I came here for the lunch and had the $30 "lunch tasting" which consisted of assorted sashimi/sushi, assortment of tempura, grilled fish and beef  fillet steak, soba noodles, and dessert.  I would descrbe the food as boring.  Not much, if at all, different from the sushi at any other midtown sushi place...  Nothing to hate, nothing to love... just very, very average...
Chris C.}Plainfield, NJ}130}347}49}18}5}10/28/2008}What can you say, if you've eaten here you feel cooler just for doing so.  The place is marvelously cool, not for its over the topness, or for a 6 million dollar staircase. The experience tranports you to Tokyo.  The sake prices if you go high end are outrageous. I can tell you that I have a better appreciation for good sake now more than ever.  I would still trade a glass of 2004 Can Blau for any of the sake there but that's just me. The food is very traditional and very good, nothing visionary here.  The experience and ambience is worth the price though, and this is something I usually would never say with regard to food.
Amy Y.}New York, NY}3}24}30}-1}4}10/12/2008}Great sake, for one who does not like sake, I actually did.  Have the server recommend some.  Every dish we tried were delicious, except for the rice porridge and fried chicken.  My favorite was the eel w/ cucumbers, and the beef tips roasted on a stone.  Get ready to spend a lot of money on small portions, but it was well worth it.  Service was a bit slow, have time to savor the food, talk, and wait.
Aimee A.}Los Angeles, CA}182}500}26}-1}5}10/7/2008}My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last weekend as a surprise. I had never heard of the place before since I never thought I liked Japanese food much. As a vegetarian, sushi wasn't my thing. But my boyfriend assured me as we descended down into the basement of the office building in Mid-Town where Sakagura is, that I would find stuff that I liked. I was skeptical, but intrigued. When we entered the restaurant, I all of a sudden became very excited. The place was SO COOL. I felt like I was in Disney World because here I was in the middle of NYC in the basement of an office building, and yet I felt like I was in Japan! The atmosphere in this place is just stunning.The food was amazing too. I've never had anything like it before, but I loved it! I had always wanted to try seaweed salad but had been hesitant to try it at your average Japanese restaurant. Sakagura was the place I thought I should try it if I ever was going to, so I did. And guess what? I LOVED IT. And I'm dreaming of their miso soup. My boyfriend and I split about 6 different dishes and we loved every single one!If you like sake, this is the place to be. They have the biggest selection in NY, and many are priced reasonably. In fact, the whole menu was priced very reasonably. For the two of us we spent less than $100 and we ate A LOT!It takes a lot for a place to earn 5 stars from me on Yelp, but Sakagura seriously is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life and this is coming from someone who didn't think she liked Japanese food!
AJ K.}Brooklyn, NY}3}28}0}-1}5}10/3/2008}"It's so real dude, it's so real..."This was the first thing out of my friend's mouth and the perfect introduction to Sakagura. I have never had such an amazing, fresh, and traditional japanese meal in my life. I have been waiting to try sakagura for months now, as it has not been easy to talk many of my less-than-adventurous friends into trying a truly traditional japanese restuarant with no sushi on the menu. But thankfully, last week my friend dragged me up to Brooks Brothers so I had an excuse to walk us over a few blocks to sakagura. I loved how sakagura was hidden right across from Sushi Yasuda and next to Yakitori Totto in the basement of an office building. Score one for Sakagura! We were initially turned away, but after some discussion about sake and then staging a walk out, we were chased to the top of the stairs by the hostess, who in fact did seat us, and at a nice table at that. Score two for sakagura. Sakagura has the best sake list I've ever seen. And that includes Decibel. I thought they had it on lock down, but sakagura is the only place that can match them. More premium sakes here than I have ever seen on one list, and there were not only big names, but small breweries represented as well. Both japanese and american importers were on the list, which showcased a full range of all different types of sakes. I was tended to patiently by the staff while I asked endless questions, trying to find the right sake. I did find the perfect bottle with their help, and they were nice enough to let me taste two so I could make up my mind. Score 3 for Sakagura.  On to the menu:This was some of the freshest fish I've ever had in my life. I felt like they smacked me in the face with a live fish and said "take a bite!" Most plates were between $8-15, with many under $12. My friends and I ordered seaweed salad (hands down best that I've ever had) and a cold spinach dish with mashed sesame seeds to start. Miso Soups followed, and NOT the salty prepackaged kind. It was the real deal, with either tofu or shiitake mushrooms, your choice. Awesome. Sake marinated deep fried chicken was incredible, perfectly cooked, crispy outside and perfect inside. Hirame sashimi was also incredibly good, and the real fish roe (none of that canned/crap in a jar) is what solicited my friends' statement about the "REAL" factor of their food. An amazing sashimi over rice with salmon, tuna, squid, yellowtail, and more was just incredible, and only $15. I've never seen anything with a price:quality ratio like that, and in midtown manhattan nonetheless! The one thing that I have to say was too weird for me was the fermented soy beans that came with my tuna sashimi. I have to blame this on myself, I was not prepared for the slimy, mid-fermentation soy beans that had a texture that was absolutely not edible for my american palate. Slimy things come out of, and do not go into peoples' bodies, and that texture I just cannot handle. However, I know that in Japan people eat many-a-slimy food items, so no criticism from me on that. :)  Another favorite of mine from the meal was the home-made pork shumai with lotus root. This was the absolute best shumai ever, and we had to order a second plate. After sake and food, we were too stuffed for desert. That was too bad because I hear it is really good. I'll save that for next time.To summarize, Sakagura is the best quality food, and the best value that I've had from any Japanese establishment in the city. I would go back any chance I get, and cannot wait for another opportunity to peruse that sake list. I need to post one WARNING: this is NOT an american japanese restaurant. If you don't like really fresh fish, or if you cannot eat food that tastes like the ocean, DO NOT eat at sakagura. This is NOT a fusion restaurant, and you will not find ANY of the americanized dishes here. Sakagura is the place for a truly traditional and amazingly fresh japanese meal, and some great sake. It is NOT for people afraid of trying something new. Kanpai!
Aaron T.}San Francisco, CA}36}351}0}-1}5}10/1/2008}I like the hidden aspect of Sakagura; it makes me feel as if I am going somewhere illicit.  The restaurant is located in the basement of an office building, and has no windows.  They have decorated the place nicely so that it feels like you are in Tokyo, not in a windowless space.  The bathrooms are in barrel shaped rooms.The raw fish is quite good.  Sakagura serves sashimi but no sushi, so don't go expecting that.  It is an izakaya not a sushi restaurant.  The sake is the reason to go here.  They have the best and most comprehensive sake list in the city.  It is fairly priced and they also offer several interesting flights of sake so you can try a bunch and figure out what is most to your liking.The food goes well with the sake.  Some unusual stuff too.  Quality is very high.  It is a real experience in every sense.
Janet C.}Arlington, VA}10}121}11}-1}4}9/20/2008}got to the building around 5:45pm, when the security guard for the building said they open at 6:00. no biggie, we walked around the block and came back. asked for a table for two, but apparently since we didnt make reservations, we could only be seated at the bar, which was cool because the bartender was really nice and helpful, recommending a type of sake that went with our food (some type of ginjo, i think, and we had a carafe of it), which happened to include: buta kakuni (stewed pork), chicken meatballs, chicken karaage, maguro with grated mountain yam (it was strange, but tasty - the grated mountain yam is gooey), hirame ponzu (fluke with grated daikon), and saikoro steak. they were all tasty tasty, but as tasty as they were, i would have to say our dessert was the best - black sesame creme brulee. it doesnt sound great but it was effing delicious. including tax and tip, our bill was almost $100, but i think it was worth it. it was!
robert c.}Los Angeles, CA}1}5}0}-1}5}9/4/2008}Probably one of the best japanese meals I have ever had. Makes you feel like you have found a hidden jewel with it's basement location, and the decor is awesome.We had the white fish in vinegar marinade, teriyaki chicken meatballs, sake marinated deep fried chicken chunks, and one of the specials that night which was beef cooked over a hot stone with an amazing ponzu sauce. Absolutely wonderful!My only wish is that I lived in NYC so I could eat here more often.
Grace Y.}New York, NY}111}239}8}-1}5}9/3/2008}After putting Sakagura on my long list of places in New York I want to check out, I finally decided to venture into midtown with my mom and Chris to see what all the buzz was about.  I had a long list of things I wanted to try (especially because the portions are small) and we decided that everyone at the table would order two dishes (to start) and we'd add on as needed.  We ordered the soft shelled crab (one of the specials of the night), eggplant, chicken, fried potato balls,  shrimp balls, and one fish dish.  Everything was delicious (especially the crab) and we all left incredibly satisfied.  Sakagura also has a LOT of sake's to choose from (they also help you pair the sake with dishes you're ordering) and the waitstaff is really helpful.  I'm trying to make reservations to go again, but they're always booked now!
tobias t.}New York, NY}0}1}0}-1}5}8/26/2008}A Japanese friend told me they have one of the best sake bars in town. A hard bill to fill as the competition for best Japanese anything in NYC is pretty fierce. Fast forward to my first visit and I was amazed not only by the Sake collection, but also by the incredible tapas style dishes we ate. The sushi/sashimi was unbelievably fresh and the chicken and bbq beef dishes equally amazing in quality and taste.This hidden basement resto made me feel as if I were in Tokyo.Sakagura is A MUST if you want to experience Japan in NYC.

shanti s.}San Francisco, CA}17}22}1}-1}5}8/20/2008}i have written a lot of 5 star reviews because i don't want to waste my time and efforts on mediocre places and my mother taught me that if i didn't have anything nice to say i shouldn't say anything at all (unless it's about dojo's). that's why i have only been writing reviews on places that i think are stellar. when my friend chris  and i went here for the first time we both said "holy sh!t" and almost crapped our pants. this place makes me want to cry. i knew the place was going to be promising when we discovered we were the only one and a half non-japanese people in there except for one other group of two or three caucasian people. we were given a gift certificate here by our employers because chris won a contest selling the most sake at the restaurant we worked at. when we asked them to make sure the certificate was valid they told us that we wouldn't get cash back for any unused portion of the gift certificate. we laughed in their faces and literally said "bring it on". the food menu excited us but the advanced sake menu made us wet ourselves. needless to say say we walked out of there with stomachs full, with the perfect amount of tipsy, wallets with about $140 less in them each, and happy as hookers on payday. i have been back several times and the place never ceases to amaze.
Ling L.}Fremont, CA}6}63}0}-1}5}8/19/2008}Love love love Sakagura's!!!  I used to live in Japan and this place is quintessential Japan!  I tried the lunch tasting menu.  Tried fish tempura for the first time here.  The sushi was fantastic - loved the hotate (scallops) and the sake (salmon).  Beef was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  Tried sesame creme brulee here for the first time and absolutely LOVED it!  But I love sesame and I also love creme brulee, so you really couldn't go wrong with combining 2 things I already liked a lot.Staff were attentive and all spoke Japanese.  Service was impeccable - only minor complaint is that they do get busy and take more time to refill the tea than I would have like.
Mia D.}Orinda, CA}3}82}0}-1}3}8/14/2008}Well, I was in NYC for a meeting and wanted to go somewhere "good", in the Midtown East area.So, I found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try!We found the location no problem, they have signs now and after reading the reviews here (thanks!), finding it was a piece of cake.I will say we were there for LUNCH, so I think that is the reason for this kind of a review.We got there at 11:50 and they gave us a coupon for either free soba, free drink or sake.  What we didn't realize was that it's for our next visit...from 11:30-12:00 and it expires 8/31/08!  So, anyone who wants it, let me know and I'll mail it to ya!  First bad thing - the napkins smelled atrocious!  Seriously, like they had used it to swab the gross stairs on the way down...they apologized and got us new napkins which were not offensive...not a great way to start off the meal.Then they tell us, they don't "do" sushi at lunch - another disappointment...I love to start off my meal with a handroll.  Oh well.I ordered the special uni soba - I am a HUGE fan of uni.  So for $16, I got 2 tiny slivers of uni with a bowl full of soba.  Really?  I realize this is NYC but the amount of uni was less than I would have gotten from one piece of uni sushi and they charged me $16?  for that and a plate full of noodles?  sigh...luckily I also ordered the tuna and avocado salad which was good but the avocados were bruised and the salad didn't have enough dressing.  The tuna was good though...My co-worker got the sashimi lunch and he liked it but I would definitely have been hungry if I had eaten what he had.I ordered the house made dessert - I can't remember what it was called but it had red bean inside and it was a buckwheat pancake on the outside I think?  So sort of like mochi but not sticky rice-y...it was okay.So, I think if I were a frequent NYC visitor, I would go, but for dinner so I could try the sushi and also sample the sake.
Jason L.}San Francisco, CA}8}18}0}-1}4}8/13/2008}My cousin introduced me to Saka Gura when I lived on the East Coast - the restaurant has the allure of being vaguely subterranean and a small sign outside of a commercial building provides a subtle "I know I'm good and I don't need to tell people I am" vibe.  My recent visit confirmed the goodness of the place - an extensive sake list covering a large binder and several special seasonal sakes and well prepared, thoughtful Japanese bar food.  For those who haven't tried this sideline of Japanese cuisine (which appears to be on the upward trend of late), it's not the typical sashimi, nigiri, and rolls, it's slow braised beef tongue, pork belly, grated Japanese mountain potato with tuna, fried karage (chicken), and various picked veggies.  All delicious here at this fantastic restaurant.  Some warnings:  expect a large bill if you're going to sample sake (the sake recommended to me was $55 and $65 per wooden box - slightly larger portion than a standard glass).
Daphne H.}San Francisco, CA}78}444}18}-1}5}8/11/2008}Wow, you guys weren't kidding when you all reviewed this place.Sakagura is truly a diamond in the rough. As we entered the office building of 211, my boyfriend gave me weird looks as we descended into the basement. This certainly wasn't a place for a 4-5 star Japanese restaurant! Clearly, we weren't the only ones who knew about this little midtown secret. There were no tables available on an early Sunday evening, so we took seats at the bar, in front of all the glorious premium sake bottles.This place isn't cheap. Especially if, like us, you're used to going to Oh Taisho and Yakitori Taisho for your izakaya. However, the izakaya experience here is simply worlds apart from the little joints that line St Marks. Dishes will range from $5 to $15 a plate. Last night, we ordered the following:Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly)The fried sardines with spicy mayo dipThe duck breast rolled with scallionThe Kimchi and Sashimi DonThe Tamago and eeland for dessert: The Chocolate Souffle!!!! OMG.And for a summer special, they had some premium sakes on sale. $12 a glass from $24. I had a divine glass of sake Jumai Ginjo Urakasumi - it was so fine and fragrant, nothing like i've ever tasted!! Mind you, I've never had a glass of  premium sake in my life so this was tantilizing to my taste buds and so smooth! Going for $12 in a cute Riedel-ish glass, this was the good stuff compared to our usual $8 a serving of sake in the signature white bottle and 2 tiny cups.We had a fantastic dinner and I was very impressed by how fine the food was. The service was impeccable, as we sat at the bar, our bartender/server was attentive and knowledgable in his sakes. It was 5 star izakaya dining. The sake alone is worth the 5 stars. I'm bringing my folks here the next time their in town. The damage at the end of the night?$42 per person before tip. Not too shabby in my opinion... :D
Frank C.}Richmond Hill, NY}5}16}0}-1}4}8/10/2008}My friends and I were trying to follow Bourdain's foot steps in NYC....so one of the places he visited was in "No Reservation" (the t.v. show) was Sakagura. Gotta say I was very pleased. They had ultra tasty Japanese "tapas" and a great sake selection. The waitress was very helpful and recommended some great sake. Adding to the cool factor of this place was the hidden in plain sight aspect of Sakagura. Pretty cool...it made a doofus like me feel he was privileged enough to find this "secret"...a "secret" shared by 60 other people eating there!
Erika P.}New York, NY}23}167}0}-1}5}8/3/2008}Sakagura typifies a certain yelp struggle: Do you share it to give it patronage so hopefully it'll stay around, or do you keep it because it's such a delicious secret? Fortunately, Sakagura is no secret. But it feels like one.Using the parking garage as your guide, walk somewhat confusedly through a seeming New York Office building, greet the ineffectual night guard, and warily descend the stairs to the basement where the mustiness opens up into this magical little world. The food is quaint, expensive and amazing. The waiters help you digest the staggering sake menu. And, though perhaps not very Japanese, the chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce is my staple.As a concluding note, [women] have to use the women's bathroom. The toilet is insane.
Michael D.}New York, NY}78}185}1}-1}5}8/1/2008}Decibel's brother, grown up and sufficiently-well-paid to afford to splurge a bit on food and drink -- that's SakaguraProbably New York's greatest little secret sake bar that isn't really a secret at all. Afterall, 98 Yelp reviews, written up this week (together with other izakayas ) in the New York Times  travel.nytimes.com/2008/… , how big a secret could it be?Well, secret or not, it's still great...and not terribly crowded on a recent Thursday evening (about a ten minute wait for two, without a reservation).It's a great pleasure to sit at the long, warm, wooden bar, admire the bottles of sake and glasses and sample their sake tasting sets. Try the tasting sets, enjoy tapas-sized items like beef tongue, grilled squid, or sardine crackers and sit back and be glad you're here!
Tushar T.}Manhattan, NY}9}27}0}-1}5}7/28/2008}Sakagura (aka 'Decibel for adults') is a great spot for very solid izakaya style Japanese.  The sake list is overwhelming - tons to choose from across all types of sake.  The food is fantastic!  The miso eggplant dish, the kimchee sashimi rice bowl,  various tofus, meat that you can cook at your table... even the desserts are very good.  You have to walk into an office building and then down some stairs to find this spot - a little strange, but worth the effort.  If you're looking for something a little different than a standard sushi joint, this is a great option.  Decibel is still awesome (and I believe has the same owners), but Sakagura is a little more refined, and the food here is definitely a few levels better.
Emily K.}New York, NY}14}234}0}-1}5}7/20/2008}A fantastic izakaya that takes all the cozy elements of a Japanese drinking establishment without the cramped space of it all. Sakagura's specialty is in sake, if you couldn't guess by the countless sake bottles behind the bar. I have yet to try the sake, but I hear they make good recommendations, even if you're a sake novice or aren't so enamored by sake (the latter, I suspect, because most of us just haven't had very good sake). They were offering Yebisu beer when I went recently, which I haven't seen as frequently at other Japanese restaurants.The food is good for sharing for about 3-4 people at max (per dish). - Jagadango: fried potato/mochi croquettes; chewy and baby-soft at the same time...  a little bland, and I'd rather they gave us a side of sugar than salt. But still very good.- Braised beef cubes with daikon: tender, flavorful chunks of beef in a broth with the lightness of grated daikon = everyone scrambling to get the last piece.- Nasu dengaku: 3 kinds of miso on eggplant. Nice mix of flavors--the green one was bland, the red was salty, but the yellow was perfect. They don't skimp on the eggplant slices either.- Chawanmushi: Steamed egg custard with salmon roe, shrimp, mushrooms. You'd think it'd be boring but the salmon roe adds a bit of needed saltiness.- Kimchi sashimi rice bowl: Ridiculously simple--it's just kimchi and slices of raw tuna over rice--but it totally hits the spot. Good combination.- Black sesame creme brulee: Not grainy at all, super creamy, super black sesame-ness.Pricey, yes, but it's okay: I felt like I paid exactly what I should have not just for the good food but the entire atmosphere. (If you've ever been to Sake Bar Decibel in the East Village, you might find it familiar here--they are sister restaurants, and you could say Sakagura is a slightly more upscale--but not stuffy, it's classy--version of Decibel.) Perfect for a low-key girls night out or a date spot. I
Bill H.}Berkeley, CA}1175}897}58}18}5}7/16/2008}Back in my management consulting days, Sakagura was a highly recommended restaurant by the client- who-shall-remain-nameless. It was pitched as a "cool place for noodles". Understatement of 2006.This place is in the basement of an office building (on 43rd between 2nd and 3rd). It's as hard to get to as you think it is. It's somewhere to the right of a nice Japanese restaurant, in the back, and down the stairs. The trip down gave me a shady feeling about the place -- lots of cinder block, exposed pipes, and must.The restaurant itself is a 180-degree turn. The interior is beautiful. Wonderfully lit, the restaurant features rows and rows of sake bottles, and just the right mix of Japanese art and cool artsy barness. It's definitely the kind of place you'd take someone just to impress them with your knowledge of hidden-and-cool restaurants.My co-worker and I sat down at the lunch bar, and were presented with the menu. They've got a number of lunch options between $10 and $17 dollars, and a load of sake choices. We started with some wonderful tofu soaking in some delicious sauce (sorry, I totally forgot what was in the sauce). I give it one ding for not being chopstick-friendly. The tofu literally disintegrated as we picked it apart. By the time we were "done", 20% of the tofu was sitting in the sauce, in pieces too small to grab with the chopsticks. Oh well.I ordered some sake (for lunch, yes), and the "daily special" -- which was a bowl of cold noodles, a bowl of sticky rice topped some sort of creamy goodness, and two small side dishes with unidentifiable vegetables. As you can tell, I didn't do a good job remembering what I ordered. But, it's not entirely my fault. The food was very bland, even though the quality of the rice and the noodles were good. I was served a miniscule amount of ginger and wasabi -- spicing things up wasn't really an option. I was also served what I believe was a box filled with lukewarm and cloudy water as something to cleanse my palette. Very, very interesting.Sakagura is way cool, and it reminds me that I am way moronic when it comes to Japanese cuisine. II hope to go back to learn more.
Jeff C.}New York, NY}1142}1258}14}-1}5}7/13/2008Updatedreview}UPDATE 02/06/09:BTW, the dessert here are hidden gems. All are excellent, esp the pear millefeille and the black sesame creme brulee, which is to die forServing lunch now 11:30pm-2:20pm. They have lunch specials for $10.95, a steal. Lunch specials change every month. I recently ordered BARA CHIRASHI DON [Assorted Variety of Chopped Sashimi and Dried Squash Over Rice Served with Soba Noodle] as a lunch special...what a deal!Pics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…Also tried:-Sake Ikura Don ($16.00) Fillets of Salmon Sashimi and Salmon Roe steeped in Sweet Soy Sauce Served Atop a Bowl of Sushi Rice,with Soba Noodles ( Hot or Cold ) - OUT OF THIS WORLD!, Ikura was huge and not salty at all, salmon was fresh UPDATE 9/25/08:Sakagura (Akinobu Suzuki, Hisaya, Kadoi) - 2008 Joy of Sake Event. Their featured dish was Smoked Duck - complex in flavor but a big tough for me, still like Kyo Ya's much betterPics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…UPDATE 7/13/08:We decided to stop by after Tsukushi for dessert/drinks. Very impressed that they carry over 200 bottles of sake here. They even have Dassai23/50, Kubota Manju/Hekijyu/Senjyu!  Even more impressed with the consistency of their desserts and the presentation of it. When we went at 11pm, they had already run out of Black Sesame Creme Brulee and Goma (Black Sesame) TrufflesOrdered the following:-Kubota Senjyu ($45/bottle) - smooth and clean as always-Pear Tart w/ Earl Grey Ice Cream ($7) - tasted like two pieces of pear drizzled w/ sabayon and sandwiched btwn homemade crispy crackers..DELICIOUS!My friends had:- Buta Kakuni ($4.50) [Sakagura's Special stewed diced pork] - looked damn good-Duck Negimaki - slices of duck folded negimaki style...looked yummy!-Chocolate Souffle ($7) [Served w/raspberry sauce & vanilla ice cream] - I tasted this, very complex, although no idea what kind of choco they use, not Valrhona
Lauren L.}New York, NY}28}103}17}-1}4}7/11/2008}I think 75% of the appeal of this place lies in the fact that it's 'hidden' in the basement of a random office building and it's sort of a secret. That combined with the decor centered around sake. Going down that unmarked staircase into a nondescript, slightly fluorescently lit basement and stumbling into this Japanese restaurant just gives you such a great little feeling. It's like you know a secret that 99.9% of New York doesn't know about. That said, the food didn't completely live up to the decor/awesome little feeling. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I wouldn't say that it was necessarily better than other izakaya places in the city. If compared to say...Aburiya Kinnosuke, I think I would choose Aburiya for food and Sakagura for decor/ambiance. I'm not a big sake drinker, so I can't comment on that, but they did seem to have a huge selection of sake and there were suggested pairings with all the dishes.I found all the savory dishes solidly good. The eggplant sampler was a tad disappointing, the miso far overpowered the slices of eggplant it was served atop. There was a beef ribs dish that was delicious, it had a distinct, comforting homecooked flavor. The pork special was fatty and very good, but definitely get one to share between two people as it can get a bit too rich. I really enjoyed the fried mashed potato dish, they had a highly interesting texture, a tiny bit of a mochi feeling almost. I would gladly eat those over french fries any day. And lastly, the dessert was the dish that was my favorite that night. We ordered the black sesame creme brulee that came adorned with a sesame crisp and a small scoop of sesame ice cream. I'm a big fan of black sesame flavored desserts (hence my trips to Sundaes and Cones for their sesame ice cream and Kyotofu for their sesame tofu). I have to say that Sakagura's sesame creme brulee kicks the s**t out of Kyotofu. Where Kyotofu's sesame tofu/pudding was slightly bland, Sakagura's had texture variation in in the caramelized top, the ice cream, the crisp, and swirled little ribbons of ground sesame throughout, providing an overall amazing dessert. I would definitely come here again just for the wow-factor of showing friends the hidden restaurant as well as for the dessert. The meal portion was very tasty too, so it gets 4 stars. The food simply did not amaze me.
Mi-ryeong K.}Silver Spring, MD}4}9}0}-1}4}7/7/2008}my friends and i fondly refer to sakagura as the "bat cave" with the underground seating and cavernous ambience.  we particularly loved the sprinkled salt around the doorway (to keep away unwanted and evil spirits) and the simple decor of japanese izakaya's.  as for the food, we ordered the hirame carpaccio and the maguro tar tar (both excellent), a bowl of the stinkiest natto around and the most memorable cold uni soup i've ever had.  my friend said it best when he said, "it's not necessarily the quality of their food that i'm so happy with but the variety of cool dishes!"we had their dessert sampler which was absolutely delightful~  i actually started clapping my hands when i saw our waitress bring out the dessert tray.caveats?  the entrance is a 'bit hard to find.  their signs are a little obscure but i think if anything, that adds to the allure.  sakagura is most definitely one of the best kept secrets of nyc, and quite literally part of the "underground" restaurant scene.  i used to go to sushi yasuda (right down the street) quite often but with difficulties in making reservations and the near impossibilities of walk-ins, sakagura offers a nice alternative to an otherwise spoiled evening.
Michael L.}New York, NY}53}189}0}-1}5}7/6/2008}Sakagura is a thoroughly solid entry for izakaya (Japanese tapas) food.  In Japan, maybe I would only give this a 4 star, since nothing reached above expectations and really surprised me.  This is still the best izakaya I've been to in New York, though, and if you're new to izakaya food, you're really in for a treat.The entrance is distinctly hard to find, in the back of a nondescript high-rise that you take a flight of stairs or elevator down to.  Once inside though, the interior space is marvelous.  I also got a real kick out of the hidden bathrooms.
Debbie K.}New York, NY}59}141}1}-1}4}6/30/2008}Oy, i ate so much when i went here last weekend.  The dishes are tiny, but deceptively filling.  Or maybe we just ordered a lot.  It's japanese small plates essentially, and accordingly I recommend going with a group to get to taste a bunch of the dishes.  LOVES: the agedashi tofu melts in your mouth.  the cold soba is perfectly cooked.  Hirame Carpaccio - the fluke, roe and shiso combo is magical.  Kimchee sashimi rice bowl - one of the more filling options and i can't say no to kimchee, ever.  Spinach - delicious but teeny tiny.  Black Sesame Cream Brulee - great sesame crunch.  SO-SOS: the eggplant 3 styles - I tried two of them: LOVED one and the other was just ok.   Mashed Potato in Donut Batter - conceptually super exciting but didn't taste much like potato and I wished the dip was sugar, not salt.  MEHS: the chocolate dessert special - it was not that good and had some fruit cocktail thrown on top.  Overall, a fantastic meal with a lot to excite the palate.  Service was also outstanding.  We had a water spill and a server showed up with a dishcloth in literally seconds.  They have ESP.  What a great find!
Jacqueline T.}New York, NY}10}4}2}-1}5}6/2/2008}This was such an amazing dining experience!  Well worth the money, every single dish on the menu is fantastic and pretty good sized.  The kakuni was amazing!  And their desserts were wonderful too, the sesami creme brulee was yummmy and the homemade truffles  come in 3 different flavors (green tea, chocolate, strawberry)
Diana G.}New York, NY}12}116}0}-1}5}5/29/2008}My 100th review--hmm, no pressure here, really.I've loved Sakagura for years--great food (one friend swears the soba there is the best he's had since Japan, and I'm addicted to the onigiri), an incredible sake list, and an amazingly serene atmosphere that drops your blood pressure by 20 points just by walking in. Not to mention the occasional, Insane sake tastings (think the -entire- bar lined with bottles). Plus it's owned by the same people who run Decibel (love!) and the quickly-defunct Megadecibel. They added an outstanding pastry chef a couple of years ago as well, so now it's even more full of win.  Plus the coolest entrance ever.  It never fails to amuse me to bring a new person there--their expression is all 'Umm, you're leading me down the icky basement stairs? Great....' then they walk in the door.  It and Decibel are like Japanese speakeasies, only with excellent sake instead of bathtub hooch, and no police raids.My only complaint? Now there's the big sign outside the entrance, and everyone else knows about it too. *laugh*
Art S.}Danville, CA}2063}142}0}-1}5}5/27/2008}As my boy Flavor Flav would say..."Wow, wow, WOOOOOOW"!!  This is truly a Japanese experience.  The food here was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  This was a fantastic surprise which we owe to Yelp.  There is NO WAY IN HELL that we would have ever found this place without the help of our trusted and true Yelp.When you first come upon the address you become a little leery, "is there a restaurant here"?  You walk into the lobby of some sort of educational facility, there's a guard sitting there you ask, "restaurant", he says "downstairs", you begin to head down.  The whole time we are walking down we are going "ok, this is strange".  But once you get there you are transported to Tokyo.  Just about everyone who works here is Japanese expect for a couple of bus boys and I would say 85% of the people eating there were Japanese!  A very GOOD SIGN.The food here is OUTSTANDING, we were absolutely blown away by two dishes in particular the duck appetizer and the egg plant tasting menu dish.  All our dishes we enjoyed very much and they have a huge sake selection.  I could go on and on but to sum it all up!!  The food, the drink, the service...OUTSTANDING.  We will most definitely be coming back to Sakagura next time we are in Manhattan!
Kristen S.}San Francisco, CA}551}912}504}18}4}5/24/2008}Absolutely delicious.  The walk down to the basement can be misleading.  It smelled funky (basements have a smell!), and looked unpromising.  However, once you get in, it looks like a hidden treasure, tucked away in secret, a heaven for your taste buds.Warning: the portions are undeniably small.  Go for dessert somewhere else (to get that feeling of - aaahhhhh, now I'm full).Speciality: a wonderful array of sake.  I've never seen a thicker, more extensive sake menu.  They sure live up to their name (Sakagura means Sake Cellar).
Diana N.}NY, NY}73}646}0}-1}5}5/21/2008}You can't miss the big 211 sign on east 43rd street between 2nd and 3rd Ave, but if you're not paying attention, you might miss the entrance to this hidden restaurant.  It's a converted office building, so you enter a huge lobby area and look for the sign to direct you down about two flights of stairs into the depths of the basement.  Once inside Sakagura, it's like you're transported into a whole different place.  The food is abolutely delicious and service is impeccable.  For appetizers, we tried:- nasu dengaku (grilled eggplant with 3 kinds of miso sauce) - i love eggplant!  it's grilled perfectly, not too mushy- buta kakuni (sakagura's special stewed pork) - yummy melts in your mouth pork- hirame carpaccio (sliced fluke w/ salmon roe, plum paste, shiso leaf and olive oil) - the fish was very fresh, they served this dish first so it wasn't overpowered by our more savory optionsFor my main dish - I ordered a kimchee sashimi rice bowl - it was refreshing and satisfying.  The kimchee was not super strong, so it didn't overpower the fish.  The rice bowl also comes with miso soup, which I found to be too salty, but otherwise, it was a really good meal.I don't remember the name of the dessert - but it had earl grey ice cream, pears, and other assorted goodies in a pretty assembly.This place is quite spacious and good for groups, but it's a good idea to always call ahead (even on a week night).  Sakagura is apparently related to Decibel (the sake bar in the east village).  Since it was a weeknight, we didn't try any of the sake at Sakagura, but the restaurant has their own specialty sakes, so I would go back and try the different varieties.Overall, two thumbs up for the quality of food, service and ambience.
Romanie G.}New York, NY}10}31}0}-1}5}5/20/2008}So one day my brother and I were walking with my dad in midtown when he asked us if we wanted to see something cool. He led us to a nondescript corporate building and headed into the stairs leading to a basement. Confuzzled, my brother and I gave each other looks that said "Dad is out of his mind." Turns out, not so much. Since then, we've been intrigued and dying to go to Sakagura to try the sake and the food. Primarily a sake bar, the food is tapas style- smaller portions but talk about delicious. We had the Saiya Sake sampler, which was a great trio of smooth, fragrant sakes. We also had the seasonal sashimi, grilled squid, grilled chicken, steamed egg custard, agedashi tofu, deep fried soft shell crab and the specialty steamed/braised pork...all were oishi (translation: delicious!)  Dessert was equally good- we got the chocolate souffle, black sesame creme brulee and the coffee jell-o (though this was not that great, the other two were super tasty). Great hidden gem in New York- so cliched, I know, but totally worthy of the term. And the bathroom is apparently awesome.
l w.}Brooklyn, NY}6}50}0}-1}3}5/12/2008}the food is delicious and elegant. The Sake menu, however, is for experts. There are hundreds of types of Sake and it can be intimidating if you do not know what you are ordering.
Maria M.}New York, NY}247}509}52}-1}5}4/30/2008}As my list of Sakagura favorites grows, I feel that I must rework my review.  What is on this list?  Please, to read:In Tokyo, I had a dish called Oyako Don, and try as I did, I could not find anything like it at "authentic" Japanese restaurants here.  Most places just fry a chicken cutlet , throw it on a bed of rice and crack an egg over it.  Horror.  My search was becoming desperate.Sakagura prepares Oyako Don exactly the way I had it in Tokyo: tender chunks of organic chicken with a tasty mix of onions and egg over rice.  That was my introduction to Saka.  A couple of luncheons later, a friend turned me on to Sake Ikura Don, salmon slices with salmon roe, steeped in sake, over rice, Tori Tsukune, chicken meatballs, and then today, the vegetable tempura, which was unlike any other tempura I've ever had before: fresh vegetables, lightly breaded, not too greasy.  I have stuck to my first two standards for a very long time with only one or two meanderings, but today, I tried the Kamo Nanban Soba, noodles (they are known for their homemade noodles) with slices of roast duck in a hot broth.  The broth was not salty and instead, very smooth and comforting.  For dessert, I love the pear millefuille, the black sesame creme brule, and the chocolate "lava" cake with raspberry sauce.  Delicious!  A new dessert item has been added recently, which I sampled today, a buckwheat "Mochi" filled with azuki, red beans.  To drink, I had a new item, buckwheat beer.  It is worth mentioning that this beer is touted as a great source of protein and vitamin B12, not to mention, very low in calories.  You may want to search for this item in your favorite Asian market.  I know I will.  The portions are very much to my satisfaction, and can sometimes be too much to finish!  The dessert menu is excellent, and made in typical Japanese style: with care, almost to perfection.  The sake selection is also excellent, and the waitstaff is very knowledgeable about their wares.  The owner also owns Decibel, so they have to be.  The staff are very nice, patient, courteous, and don't have an attitude even though they know they can fill their restaurant to capacity every day.  I used to be able to just walk in with my crew, but as of late, I've had to make reservations.  Lunch prices are reasonable.I had dinner there only once so far, and this is where the meal gets pricey.  Still very much worth it, though.  Dinner there unwittingly put me on a lay away plan (not the restaurants) that took me approximately 5 months to pay off.  However, I don't regret it one bit.  I was with amazing company, and the food and sake was equally stellar.  Wouldn't you rather spend your money on great food, great times and getting very elegantly liquored-up than buying some status symbol that you can carry around to make others think you are hot shit?  I would.
Jenny B.}San Francisco, CA}19}87}0}-1}4}4/28/2008}This little restaurant introduced me to the concept of "Japanese Cuisine" as opposed to mere Japanese food. They also boast a great sake selection that I one day hope to properly appreciate.The entrance: makes you wonder if you're in the right place. You have to walk into what looks like an office/residential building. But walk a little further and you hear the clatter of dishes.The decor: a little quaint for my tastes, but not a bad atmosphere.The waitstaff: didn't blow my mind, but no problemThe drink selection: excellent if you like sakeThe food: certainly interesting. I'm still not sure I'm 100% sold though. Basically it all tasted fantastic but not... special. Like when your $13 or so plate of eel omelet comes with pureed mountain radish on the side and it just tastes like someone threw a radish in a blender. Or when you order a plate of fancy edamame for $10 and you get -- well -- edamame. Some of their cooked meat dishes were outstanding, however, so overall I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner.The bill: steep but won't give you a heart attack.Insider's tip - get on their mailing list; they have periodic sake tastings.
Jonathan S.}New York, NY}15}22}0}-1}4}4/27/2008}Hidden in the bowls of an anonymous midtown office building, this Japanese sake bar and restaurant has a peaceful ambiance. The entrance, in the building lobby, is unmarked save for a small gold sign pointing down a nondescript stairwell. The space inside is surprisingly large and minimally decorated with bamboo and rice paper. Although it feels more like a restaurant than a bar or lounge, the focus is very much on the sake. They've got reams of sake to go with the izakaya menu. They've also got some interesting desserts.Another one of the coveted places that make you forget you're in the middle of NYC.
Formicas F.}Queen Creek, AZ}40}373}28}-1}4}4/25/2008}What a great spot!  My friend, Sarah, took me here for lunch today and I was thoroughly impressed with the food, ambiance and especially the dessert!I ordered a curry samba noodle soup that was excellent.  Sarah opted for the daily lunch special.For dessert she had the creme brulee and I ordered the chocoloate souffle- both were excellent!I will certainly be coming back here with Matt.  Great location since it is so close to Grand Central!
Christina J.}Burke, VA}0}11}0}-1}5}4/21/2008}Probably one of the best meals I've had- it is a dining EXPERIENCE, not just dinner.  To be honest, I dined here about a few months ago, so I can't really give good descriptions about each dish- off the top of my head, we had the yuba shumai, nasu dengaku, a duck dish, and another dish of rice that came with some kimchi and sashimi on top (my favorite).  Everything was excellent.  THe service, the food...perfect.  Definitely the most authentic Japanese restaurant I've been to.  I love that it's a Japanese restaurant NOT about raw fish.
Denis K.}Manhattan, NY}70}376}87}-1}5}4/17/2008}This past Monday, my college buddy and I ended up at Sakagura after we couldn't get reservations at Nobu (at a decent hour) and Paper Moon.. was apparently no more - both places I've never been to. A lot of effort just to eat.. however our back up back up plan, Sakagura, turned out to be a real gem.Sakagura is hidden in the depths of a non-descript office building off 43rd St., a short jaunt from work. Upon first entrance, you start off by walking down a brightly lit white corridor, turn the corner through some seemingly random door, down a flight of sketchy stairs, and enter magnificent Sakagura. First thing my friend told me, "Hey, check out the bathrooms". Uh.. ok. They're shaped like large wooden sake fermentation vats! Seriously, if the bathrooms are inspired by sake, you know they're not playing around.The restaurant is gorgeous. It was like running through a forest and stumbling into the secret village of the elves in the most unlikely place. Tables are set inside wooden building facades, as if you are looking down an old village neighborhood. At the center, a long sake bar decked out in sake you haven't even dreamed of yet.We were seated immediately. Our hostess was quite friendly and chatty. The extensive sake list was a bit overwhelming, largely because it was very detailed and much of it written in Japanese. It took us awhile to figure out the various menus. I must admit, in the end, my friend chatted directly with the waitress in Japanese and ordered everything for us. My only input, "Go for it. I'll try anything".. famous last words?For drinks, my friend had the plum wine. It was golden and tasted sweet, almost like a muscadel. I had a tasting sake sampler which featured two super premium and one regular sake shots set on a little tray. You could really note the stark changes in smoothness and taste between the three tastings.As for the food, I can only describe. The first dish was spinach with sesame and a little brown sugar. Honestly, the sesame and brown sugar reminded me of a Korean songpyun, only with spinach. The waitress brought out a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and soft tofu next. It seemed more like a palate cleanser. There wasn't much flavor going on, even with the dressing. Next up, chicken! Fried to Japanese perfection that is. The skin was crisp and a rich tawny brown color. The flesh was warm and succulent. One of my favorites. Then on the waitress' recommendation, we had shrimp wrapped in fried flour skins (mandu wrap?). The dipping sauce seemed to consist of miso sauce with a little hot pepper paste mixed in. Warm and crispy with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. Definitely can't go wrong there. Our shrimp wraps were followed up with a bowl of sweet sauce. In the middle, a piece of pork sat marinating, the meat and fat still clinging together in a delicate little square. The rich fat imbued the whole dish, but didn't leave a greasy film upon tasting. It was a little sweet and a lot savory with the meat falling apart with the slightest effort. As a finale, the waitress brought a tuna tartar, half covered in cavier and the other half flying fish roe with yuzu. The tuna was fresh and clean tasting. I expected the cavier to make the dish a bit salty, but it wasn't at all. The yuzu I couldn't really taste until I let the flying fish roe roll around my tongue a bit and then the citrus taste just popped in a bold way that said "Hey! I was here the entire time".Dessert: We ordered two, a Black Sesame Creme Brulee served with ice cream and a black sesame wafer and a Chocolate Souffle' served with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Souffle' was hot to the touch and steamed when the spoon broke through the decadent, chocolately surface. Rich, vibrant, chocolate! The ice cream was a great balance, cool and calming. As for the Creme Brulee, I've never met a creme brulee I didn't like. The black sesame was an interesting take. A more modest sweetness with a sugary crunchiness. Very good.Overall, the food was a bit sweeter than normal from what I understand. Still, it was pretty good and each dish was beautifully presented.Just like when wandering into a fairy tale village, it is quite easy to lose track of time in underground Sakagura. We started dinner at 7:30pm and I still ended up missing my 1am bus back home. (I hate it when I do that..) But, there's an intangible comfort in talking and catching up with an old friend at a place like Sakagura.review 4/17/2008I.M.Y.
A W.}Washington, DC}67}53}0}-1}5}4/15/2008}A Japanese friend took me here and it was fantastic. The closest thing to having amazing Japanese food in Tokyo right here in NYC.  I had hot soba and it was scrumptious. PS Bring your JAL mileage card for free sake!!!!
carl g.}Brooklyn, NY}18}176}0}-1}5}4/1/2008}Damn! Damn! Damn! I wish I hadn't had so much damn scotch previous to going to Sakagura. My friend also was not a sake lover so I didn't sample any sake BUT I WILL BE BACK. And I will sample. And learn. And love.The food was perfect for what I wanted. But, yes, no sushi. Come for the udon and soba and pork belly and fried chicken. Actually, we did score a small sushi plate that was a special that evening. The pork belly was awesome (sing that last part). It was so tender and the broth was so tasty. Also had the baked Uni, fried pork dumplings, and a few other dishes which I have forgotten in my drunken haze. We sat at the bar and drank beer and relished leaving the stupid event we had just attended at the University Club. Thank you Sakagura for saving my Midtown evening.
Dustin M.}Skillman, NJ}19}37}0}-1}5}3/28/2008}Oh man oh man oh man. This is one fantastic restaurant. I love sake and japanese food, and as good as the food was (no sushi except at lunch), the sake list is mind boggling - kind of like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end. Just imagine bottle upon bottle of sake to try. Ask your server for help - ours was a certified sake sommelier!The dinner we had was like going to a tapas bar, only all Japanese. The fish was fresh, the pork belly was incredibly tender; everything was really fantastic. An odd place, since you have to go to the basement of a non-descript office building to enter, but it is really a fantastic meal. I love Nobu for the sushi, but this place had none of the too-cool-for-you NYC crowd that Nobu always has. Highly, highly recommend it!
John O.}Los Angeles, CA}10}905}34}18}5}3/27/2008}Subterranean Sakagura is a sake lovers dream come true.  The decor here is one of the best in the city and will "wow "first time visitors.  The sake selection is the biggest in NYC and you will find items at all price points.  With the addition of the new sake sommelier, Sakagura is better than ever.  I had a blast sitting at the bar and trying new sakes based upon her recommendations.  The sake is always served in beautiful glassware that varies based upon what you order.  Don't overlook the food because it is terrific.  Japanese bar food is a perfect compliment to high quality cold sake.  Service is always gracious and punctual, just like you would get in the old country.  This is probably my favorite bar in NYC with its sister sake bar Decibel second.
Cheryl M.}Oakland, CA}16}33}4}-1}4}3/18/2008}I love this place because it has a certain "speakeasy" feel to it, in the sense that the restaurant is located in what is essentially the basement of a large office building.Their sake menu is extensive (I think there were three separate ones!), and each bottle/carafe is presented in such a unique and beautiful display that you expect from the Japanese aesthetic.As far as the food goes, nothing knocked my socks off as much as the braised piece of pork. To be honest, I don't remember what it's called on the menu. (It might be "braised pork," go figure.) Why did I love it so? The meat and skin are simmered in this unctuous, fatty, almost gravy-like broth, rendering the meat utterly tender. And the skin? Melt-in-your-mouth, almost gelatinous gloriousness. Disregard the diet for a moment and give in to this dish.We also ordered some kind of fish collar (I forgot which one it was now, but I do know it was neither hamachi nor salmon). The salmon one I had a few nights before was larger, but the one at Sakagura was still pretty good.I don't really remember much else of what we ordered, but if I can influence you in some way, order these two things:1. Sake. Their expansive selection is their jewel in the crown. Try different kinds and ask your server for recommendations. Order the sake tasting, if you can. I didn't, but I would if I had the opportunity to go back.2. The braised pork thing. Seriously. You have no idea.
A M.}Arlington, VA}0}12}0}-1}5}3/17/2008}This place is a hidden gem.  It's located inside an office building in the basement.  Unless someone took you there, you probably wouldn't know to go there...  This place is really authentic Japanese food, evidenced by the fact that most of the patrons there are Japanese businessmen.  Always a good sign...  The dishes are small, appetizer-sized..  but really delicious and flavorful.  You have to try the dessert...black sesame creme brulee...it's really really good. Everytime I go to Sakagura, I make sure I leave room for it.
A B.}New York, NY}5}59}0}-1}4}3/8/2008}This profusely decorated basement restaurant feels like a Japanese movie set and serves up authentic, tasty small dishes. The menu humbled me as I blindly picked out a handful of items to sample, leaving me feeling like a foreigner and wishing I did more "homework" on the offerings.  Although my choices could have been more informed, everything was at least interesting and, at best, delicious. When you make a reservation, ask to be seated in the front of the restaurant; you won't regret it.
Michael D.}Culver City, CA}19}133}183}-1}4}3/3/2008}Tough call on rating this place, as it really is a 4.5 star place. The other thing is that it's right across the street from the best sushi in New York, so tough not comparing to that even if it is a different type of food. I liked the location, buried in the basement.  It did strike me as being like some of the places I've been to in Japan, where (like Manhattan) the premium on space puts bars and restaurants in all sorts of locations.The food menu, like any izakaya, is varied, and it will take you a while to figure out what to order there. But then you get to the sake menu, and your best bet unless you are a seriously refined connoisseur is to ask for recommendations from the staff.  I didn't get exactly what I was expecting (I asked for a more milky, unfiltered sake), but I still ended up with an excellent drink. Of course, on that note, expect the cost of the sake to be at least half of the cost of your bill, it was for me.I started with some stewed, battered vegetables, which didn't quite match up to the description on the menu. I was expecting mushrooms, of which there were none. The downside is that it included a pepper, to which I'm allergic and just tossed aside. The taste was decent, not something I'd seek out again.Next I got the jaga dango, an potato doughnut with an almost mochi-like consistency. I've never had these before, and they were awesome. I think I could come back to this place just for this dish. Dipped in the salt they provided, I was a rather happy man at that point.Because of the chill outside, I had the ume chazuke next. This was delicious, but that's just my partiality to the dish. Honestly, their version wasn't anything special, no better or worse than any I've had elsewhere, but still a strong dish for me.I ended with the buta kakuni, a fat steaming lump of pork. If you like pork, it's worth ordering. It pulled apart nicely, fat and all. Not heavenly pork morsels that I have had before, but still a fine dish.
Joe O.}Remsenburg-Speonk, NY}121}500}38}18}5}3/1/2008}First off, I'd just like to say that the fact that I was able to order my entire meal in Japanese gives this place a true authentic feel - one I have not once felt in NYC (and we go to Japanese restaurants a lot).  Now, from the attentive and courteous hostess to our very friendly waitress, even the bus boys - the service was impeccable.  After being somewhat taken aback at the size of both the sake and food menus', I knew we were in for something special.  We orderded five dishes: the hirame carpaccio (Sliced fluke w/salmon roe, plum paste, shiso leaf & olive oil) - amazing, light, flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth - the salamon roe gives it a tangy aftertaste.  Then onto the Agedashi - a super soft, fried tofu, topped with dailokon and hirashi - very hard to pick up with chopsticks but once you get it into your mouth, all the hard work is worth it.  The next dish was ishiyaki (basic translation is "rock cook") - this was AMAZING.  Six small slices of the most tender, moist, buttery meat we have ever eaten - the dish comes out as a steaming rock and the raw meat.  You rub this butter onto the rock (watch out, it steams like mad) then throw three slices of meat on at a time (the waitress shows you how the first time around).  In a few minutes, take them off, dip them in the sweet soy sauce and VIOLA - you have the best few slices of meat maybe in NYC (much to my girlfriends dismay, I dropped one on the ground, the hot rock is really slippery - our sullen faces were noticed by the staff).  Anyway, the last few dishes we had were the onigiri (translation: rice ball) with tangy plum and the yuba shumai (steamed pork dumplings).  Finish it off with the highly recommended black sesame creme' brulee (thanks Atif!) and you have one happy couple.  When a somewhat hidden Japanese restaurant in NYC is full of Japanese customers all speaking the language, you know it's gotta be good.  I can't wait to take my parents here the next time they are in NY!  Loved it loved it loved it....and that is all!
Dan D.}Lausanne, Switzerland}44}52}2}-1}4}3/1/2008}Very tasty food!  Totally expensive though.We had a seaweed salad which was quite nice.  The beef tongue stew was great!  I'm a big fan of tongue though. :)  The amedai sashimi with a ponzu-like sauce was also excellent, as was the grilled medai.  Oh, and let me not forget the karaage, fried chicken.  Wow, that one was really fantastic!Altogether, very authentic and delicious.  Unfortunately, one needs to pay about 3x more than in Tokyo for it here...
Tony B.}San Francisco, CA}1}36}8}-1}4}2/13/2008}this place was awesome.  It was sort of like Japan.  In some strange basement location and totally worth finding.  Not cheap, small plates, and 3 menus of sake.  I wish I could afford to go here all the time but damn is this joynt good.
Paolo B.}New York, NY}6}31}56}-1}4}2/12/2008}Easily one of my favorite places to eat. 200+ sakes and an absurdly good lunch deal. Best to make a reservation for dinner. Charming service (incl. the hot towel before & after), good green tea, and very fine food. I would sell friends for an extra scoop of the sea salt chocolate sorbet.
Anne C.}Boston, MA}7}52}2}-1}5}1/30/2008}Each time I go to NY for pleasure I make sure we come here for dinner.  It's a hidden jewel located in the basement of a commercial building.  But it's definitely a place I highly recommend.  They don't serve sushi here (they do have sashimi); the food is more like tapas style that you share with your party, and you drink sake (hot or cold) with the food.  The atmosphere is great once you enter the restaurant (even the women's bathroom is quite interesting - the facade resemble a giant bamboo tub and has a Japanese self-clean toilet).    They do take reservations (for up to 12 persons) and I recommend it, however, they're really strict with their reservation - for example, for large parties they want call you a couple times to not only to confirm the reservation but the number of people.  All the dishes are very good, even the usual Chicken Karaage (Fried Chicken) and Agedashi Tofu are exceptional here.  Definitely leave room for dessert, and my favorite is the black sesame creme brulee.
David S.}San Diego, CA}304}652}282}-1}4}1/28/2008}I went to Sakagura for lunch on a weekday with Maria M and Sean K. I don't leave the village much, so it was definitely a little weird to be surrounded by all these corporate types wearing suits and ties... but I digress.Sakagura is pretty hard to find if you don't know where it is: it's hidden in the basement of an office building, with just a little sign telling you it's there. But apparently it does not need any more publicity, since the place was packed when we got there. Thankfully, we had a reservation and were seated promptly. The restaurant is actually very large, with a very large and impressive bar along one of the walls. They have a bunch of lunch specials, and I ordered the chirashi, which came with cold soba noodles. It was very tasty, though I think I've had better chirashi before. Still... very good.And their desserts are not to be missed: as I remember, I got the black sesame creme brulee, and it was just amazing... definitely worth the 6 or 7 bucks that I paid for it.So... good food, and nice ambiance, but given the location (Midtown East!!), you probably won't see me there too often.
Carol C.}Austin, TX}91}147}9}-1}4}1/23/2008}I feel like this is a more authentic/traditional version of LAN and EN.  The food was really good although I may like LAN more.  It is in a basement, but really not all that hard to find anymore with all the signs.  I don't really think this is a secret anymore, although out of towners may feel like they've discovered something.  It has an amazing selection of sake.the black sesame creme brulee was excellent!
Joe M.}San Francisco, CA}182}23}1}-1}5}12/23/2007}Service is impeccable, sake selection is to die for, decor FEELS like you are in a small village in Japan.  Oh and the food, truly unmatched anywhere else except Japan.  I went with a friend, who is Japanese, and assured me that every small dish we ordered was authentic from the taste to the actual portions to the speed that the dishes were brought out.  Can't recommend this place enough...Be sure to finish your dinner with the Blackened Sesame Creme Brulee...WTF...amazing!
brooke f.}San Diego, CA}241}41}2}-1}5}11/25/2007}Two words: food orgasmThis place is so flippin' fantastic, that during a one week biz trip we went here TWICE! First night and last night, baby. I still dream about the 3 way eggplant and the duck with pesto....My first time there was a night of firsts: first experience with GOOD ASS SAKE, first time ordering the same dish multiple times (we ordered the eggplant 3 times) and first time with the heated toilet seat. Oh my. I didn't want to leave ;)Let's just say that this food was so damn good that my boss had to close his eyes and everyone at the table needed a "moment". Don't even get me started on the desserts... black sesame creme brulee, you are my hero. Oh, shyzzah!  Sakagura, can I love you anymore? The service was amazing, but the food. OH THE FOOD. My pocketbook would probably hate you, but you will always have a place in my heart. See you in a few months for more food O's.RECAP: Go here & except to order a lot & spend a lot. Standout dishes:  NASU DENGAKU (the eggplant), duck with pesto, the soup that comes in the big pot, seaweed salad, pork belly, organic chicken, the SAKE, black sesame creme brulee, pears with earl grey gelato, the dessert with mochi/ green tea/ other colorful things in the glass
Amir T.}New York, NY}10}25}0}-1}5}11/18/2007}Arigato Yelp...This place is soo good.  I heard about this place exclusively through Yelp reviews, and biggups to you all for not letting me down on this one.  The place is awesome.  From the ambiance to the food to the sake knowledge, Sakagura is hitting on all cylinders.  I'm not a huge sushi fan, which worked perfectly because all they have are small cooked plates and sashimi.  They have several sake options and are extremely knowledgeable.  Sakagura costs a pretty penny, but it's definitely worth the money.
Scott R.}Austin, TX}296}784}12}-1}5}10/31/2007}Glad I'm finally in the know about this underground Japanese izakaya/sake bar!  In the basement of a non-descript office building, you have to enter the building and go downstairs to find a lovely, Zen decor that I could say is Tokyo-like but I've never been to Japan.While they have a wide-ranging Japanese menu (no sushi though), I've just tried the sake (they've got a ton to choose from) and the dessert so far.  Liked the sake.  Had the green tea truffles and strawberry truffles - both were very good.  I'd compare them more to bon-bons than traditional truffles since it was ice cream inside instead of nuts/caramel/wafer/etc.  The chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream and raspberry syrup was fantastic.  As Japanese as apple pie - I know - but still really good.While this place doesn't appear to be a secret - on a Tuesday night it was full and had a number of Caucasians! - it still feels like a find and I dug the vibe.  5 stars...
Lori S.}New York, NY}1}14}0}-1}5}10/30/2007}Love love love this place.  Between Sakagura and Lan does it get much better?  Everything is amazing.  The sake list is unbelievable and make sure you have the homemade strawberry truffles.  I hate strawberry, but LOVE these truffles.   I would eat here every night if I could afford it.
Tony M.}Napa, CA}361}24}0}-1}5}10/29/2007}If you want a true Tokyo experience in NYC, this is the place. The food is fantastic. Don't walk in thinking sushi 'cause you ain't gonna find it. Come for the great sake, superb cuisine and stellar bathroom (it's in a giant sake barrel. Ask for Cheez to guide you through the most comprehensive sake selection on this side of the pacific. Be a little warned, that just like in Japan, you are going to spend and arm and a leg on a really good meal.
Paulina C.}San Francisco, CA}231}131}0}-1}5}10/2/2007}could i have one of everything on your menu please?  seriously, we were here for the first time and we started by just randomly selecting a few dishes, and by the end of the night, two girls, two hundred and fifty bucks!  the best part....I didn't have to pay!  Is it convincing enough for you to come try this place? oh and they have a wide selection of sake for you sake lovers!
May T.}Wellington, New Zealand}290}588}6}-1}5}9/24/2007}this is an absolute must visit when i'm in nyc. i love this place as it has a real tokyo feel and the best selection of sake in the u.s. food is good to great, but it's truly the sake that takes the cake. if only they let you smoke cigarettes here. then i'd truly feel like i was back in japan.
Julie E.}Los Angeles, CA}622}428}42}-1}4}9/12/2007}I distinctly remember what an amazing, unexpected surprise it was to discover Sakagura when I was living in NYC. Just a few blocks from my Murray Hill pad, there is no way I EVER would have found this place, as you have to walk through the lobby of this blank, unassuming office building and go down to the basement. You are then transported into this understated but swanky Japanese heaven, where the sake list is long, the food is delightfully delicious, and where you will spend a pretty penny for both. It's been years since I've been (and maybe the quality has gone down, given some of the less-than-stellar reviews), but my many experiences there were amazing. I still crave the eggplant three-ways...probably the best eggplant dish I've ever had. It might not be the best Japanese restaurant in New York, but it's worth a visit if you're in the 'hood!
GO-GO-YU-BALI m.}New York, NY}29}240}23}-1}5}8/25/2007}i have never had such a perfect japanese service in the united states ever!the food was also great.well, it is pricy, but it is so worth it.the people who work at the restaurant are japanese, and the atmosphere reminds me of japanese restaurants.highly recommended.
Randall F.}New York, NY}11}33}0}-1}5}7/29/2007}Located in the basement level of a midtown office building, this is truly a hidden jewel in the city.   Upon entering, you feel like you are in a restaurant in Japan.  The decor is simple yet inviting and intimate.   Service is attentive and our waitress made several great recommendations.  The dishes, although small, did taste authentic.  The chicken karage is a must-have.  It's best to order many of these tapa-like dishes and share them to experience the variety the menu provides.  Also, don't forget to try one of the 200 sakes they offer.  In short, great place for dinner, late night snacks, and sake rounds with friends.
A. T.}Palatine, IL}4}23}4}-1}4}7/22/2007}When you've been away from Japan too long, you start missing the nights out at the izakaya. And this place definitely hits the spot. That's why whenever I go to NY, I ALWAYS make sure that I go here at least one night for dinner. Their KARAAGE (fried chicken) is better than my mom's (and she's an AWESOME cook!). Of course, their endless list of sake is also what attracts me here. Hidden in the basement of a bu idling, it may be a little hard to find. But, it's like finding treasure when you've finally reached it.
Marisa B.}Chicago, IL}30}105}20}-1}4}7/6/2007}When the upscale mood strikes, I trade in my flip flops for some killer heels and head to Sakagura.  Decor is cozy and cool; the waitstaff friendly and super-efficient; the food stellar, although very expensive.The sake menu is intimidating, especially for a beer lover like me, but if you describe the type of taste you want (dry, sweet, unfiltered, etc), your server will find something to please your palate.  The sake flights are also great if you can't decide on a whole bottle.At Sakagura, diners eat with their eyes first -- the presentation is dazzling.  Our fresh sushi platter was a kaleidescope of color and texture, plated on a dark brown bamboo steamer with glass noodles and brightly colored mini-flowers.  A blue saucer and a ceramic sake cup provided "beds" for the fish.  It was a feast for the eyes...though more a sampler platter than an all-u-can-eat buffet.Sakagura's food quality does take precedence over quantity, so be aware that this is more about the overall dining experience than rolling out the door because you just had to have that last mint.
Linda T.}Chicago, IL}82}90}3}-1}5}7/3/2007}This restaurant got such great reviews everywhere that we really wanted to try it when we went to New York. We were a little scared when we walked in, because it was in the basement, and the walk down was dark... But when we walked in, it was SO beautiful, and SO romantic. We didn't know what to order, since everything looked so good. So we asked our waitress what she recommended, and that was what we ordered. The sushi was fresh and delicious. And the pear millefeuille was actually my favorite part of the night! I was so glad that I was able to share this amazing experience with my boyfriend. Be sure to try the millions of kinds of sake!
Caroline A.}Fairfax, VA}1132}1178}22}-1}5}5/28/2007}Why doesn't Chicago have anything like this??? Oh Sakagura, please come to the windy city.  I love you!  What an experience!!  First of all, the restaurant is hidden in an office building.  You walk in, go down a scary stair well, and then enter a zen like relaxing restaurant with flowing water, bamboo, candles and beauty everywhere.  This is the place for authentic Japanese cuisine and fantastic sake.  The service was amazing with friendly servers, unrushed so you can fully enjoy your experience.  We started with the Junmai Dai Gingo Sake (highest grade sake), smooth, dry and hits you about 15 minutes later.  Freaking fantastic. My BF ordered for the table... we had the following delights:Fluke Carpaccio - buttery, fresh and melts in your mouth.Raw squid with squid liver marinadeSeaweed salad with four varieties of seaweed - amazing and fresh!Egg with benito flakes and codChicken ball with sweet teriyaki - great hot dish!  Falls apart in your mouth!Eggplant broiled three ways with egg yolk, miso and spinach. Ishikaya (cooked on hot stone) waygu beef (cut in thin slices) - best piece of moo I've ever had.Udon with pickled plum and seaweed. Tuna sashimi with grated mountain yam.Filet minon with horseradish sauce - I don't recommend it.  It's kind of tough. Homemade tofu fritter in traditional broth - second favorite dish.Dessert: Chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream, Red bean and chestnut ice cream with mochi and my two favorites: black sesame creme brulee and homemade truffles (the green tea truffle is out of this world).After the decadent dinner, my BF made me go into the ladies room. After  all the sake I had, I was so excited to see the bidet!!  Fantastic!
Joolie T.}Brooklyn, NY}1083}1296}1020}-1}5}5/26/2007}what an experience! this is the sister restaurant of Decibel (in East Village)- another hidden treasure in a non-obvious location. you will not even notice the entrance unless you look closely. i like that about Japanese & Korean places. so secretive, exclusive and a delight. Maria M. recommended this place. so we gathered some of our favorite friends and on a SUNDAY night (yes, we all had work the next day!) we met up after i got off work and hopped on the train 4, 5, 6  (any of those) Uptown. this is what i was thinking before the arrival, "i hope it's not a typical sushi-packed-up-the-arse restaurant." we wait for our straggling late friend (hehe) and enter the hidden passageway to our Japanese underworld.....Oh..... my...... God....zilla! (yes, i'm cheesy). it was like i was back in Japan all over again. i experienced the same feeling over at Decibel, too. it was so perfect. as i've mentioned in other reviews... i have somewhat of a bathroom fetish. the decor, the ambiance, GOOD smell, cleanliness, accommodations, etc. (wow, sounds like a 5 star hotel suite) their bathrooms- for one person at-a-time, are like pods. you open the bamboo pod's huge door and what's there? a heated/water splashing toilet? oh my, my, my! the candles were lit, the pod didn't reek of horrible possibilities, and it's an enjoyable experience when you'd down a few shots of sake. the boys of our group were purely jealous of our amenities. lol. the fare, presentation, varieties, and service are quintessentially outstanding. this is definitely a place to take a special date, try something new with foodies, dine for a birthday/special occasion or impress some out of towner buddies of yours. the dishes are smaller portioned, but it's meant to be shared/snacked on/etc. LUNCH TIME is a great affair- and definitely a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with the food before bringing your favorite people over to this hidden oasis. i love that it's not packed or too noisy. however, hanging out with my friends... it tends to be pretty live and loud. lol. the black sesame creme brulee and green tea truffles are a MUST. after 3 bottles of delectable sake, phenomenal service, crazy laughter, and Julie K. fighting with me over her secretly pouring my sake into her glass... it was truly one of the best experiences i've had in NYC. thank you my "favorite friends of Yelp", and ULTRA thanks to Sean, thank you Julie K. for stealing my drinks (muahaha)- but making me laugh and sing "Horang Nabi" like an old Korean drunk, and of course.... thank you to the one and only fabulous Maria M. to finally introducing me to this place i've been dying to search for. ;]
Kevin L.}New York, NY}1048}1339}4392}-1}5}5/25/2007}Wall o' sake?  Non-sushi roll Japanese food?!  My cup runneth over!No, seriously.  You know how you go to those fancy restaurants (read: Del Frisco's) and they hand you this giant tome of a wine menu - and your head spins because you don't know where to start?  Yeah.  This place is pretty much the same, except it's sake instead of wine.  How can you go wrong with a veritable cornucopia of sake varieties?  Plus, they offer service in a masu (the traditional Japanese sake box on a platter, with the sake poured so that it overflows, signifying good luck).Okay, now the food.  I took an old coworker who was in town from India here a couple nights ago, and we totally chowed down on the tapas-like grub here.  Highlights: deep fried chicken chunks (lightly seasoned, very crispy, but the chicken is still tender and moist), fried shrimp balls covered in almond slivers (hello, fried shrimp balls - need I say anything more?), and definitely, definitely save room for Sakagura's truffles.  I'm especially partial to the black sesame ones - black sesame covered with white chocolate and a hint of rum.  Mmmm.  Totally devilish and decadent.Both times I've been here, the service has been impeccable.  Although I had reservations for us, the hostesses had us wait a few minutes - I assume this was to ensure quality service in the dining area because there were numerous open tables when we were seated.  Plopping ourselves down at the bar, we got to see the various drinks being poured, and there was always a wait staff ready to handle our next order.Let me repeat: wall o' sake.  Delicious small plates of food.  Great service.  Classy, chic decor.  Definitely worth checking out - more than once.
Frank M.}San Francisco, CA}266}108}26}-1}5}5/23/2007}Yo... check this out.Wow... this place is great and unique.  Saka Guri specializes in Sake... the food pairs very well with the drink.  This is modern japanese blended with hearty country type japanese food... The location... tricky to find... it is in the basement of an office building... across the street from another Japanese restaurant that has a fish symbol but no name... call and make a reservation... they are packed.I ordered the diacon salad (good), roast duck (good), unagi dish (very good) and finally, the fatty pork in broth (AWESOME)...  order two... one person can finish both... it is that good, but not so good for your cholestrol.Food prices are reasonable... those four dishes and sake came in at $54 including tax and tip... not bad at all.Enjoy!
Jason C. J.}San Francisco, CA}1540}987}640}-1}5}5/15/2007}The one place I don't mind going to on a spring day. Hot sake and some sashimi hits my tummy spot. Haven't found too many good places since my business trip here last year.
Mariana L.}New York, NY}353}594}182}-1}4}5/12/2007}The initial entry into this restaurant was somewhat tricky.  There already is a Japanese restaurant on the street level at this address.  To find Sakagura, you have to find your way through the lobby, down some ugly stairwells and finally to the entrance of the restaurant.Once you are there though, you will find yourself if a bustling Japanese shrine to Sake.  The servers seat you and promptly bring you hot towels to refresh yourself before taking on the 200+ sake menu.My girlfriend, who is native Japanese, was put in charge of the ordering, and we had no idea what items from her quick and rapid description would show up at our table.  As she doesn't drink alcohol, she was no help whatsoever in the sake department.We asked our server to recommend something, that would be appropriate to whatever just came out of my girlfriend's mouth and she pointed out a nice 'lively' choice.  Presentation seems to be one strength that all upscale Japanese restaurants seem to have.  The plating of dishes here are beautiful.  The sake came in an art-glass carafe in a big bowl of ice with wildflowers.  The tasty appetizers (well, the menu consists of small dishes, kind of like Japanese tapas, and the waitress seemed to distinguish 1st course and second by cold vs. hot) consisted of a rare beef with ponzu, pretty exotic greens, sashimi.  All very fresh.  Our hot dishes included several kinds of eggplant treatments, potato 'donuts', mackerel, a chicken meatball like dish and rice balls with miso.   This is supposed to be traditional Japanese food, so don't expect to find California and Philadelphia rolls here.  A trip to the bathroom is also an experience.  You enter what seems like a giant sake barrel.  There is a chair and desk ( I suppose if you just want to relax?) and on top of the desk is a users manual for the toilet.  This toilet is one of those you might have read about in home/architectural magazines.  It is has bidet functions, warm air functions, and other buttons I didn't immediately figure out. (I am one of the few people who prefers not to do my reading in the bathroom).As this was a night with the girls, dessert was definitely in order.  We went for the tasting for 3.  It started with a sake drenched orange compote with blueberry yogurt sorbet, light and refreshing.  Next came a platter of sweet wonders.  A black sesame creme brulee, mochi and anmitsu of exotic fruits, mille feuille of strawberries, red beans.  The tasting ended with green apple cookies and black sesame/shochu truffles.  If you are hungry and like to drink a lot of sake, prices can add up quickly.  Did I think it was worth it?  Yes!  The food was great and the evening overall was with great company, so I expect to spend some money on a good night out.
Julie K.}New York, NY}226}418}883}-1}5}5/12/2007}no more words!just check out the attached pictures that I'd taken..  and close ur eyes..READY?ok..!imagine you are seating at the table..ok..!can u smell it?  can u feel it?  can u taste it?   NOOOOOOO? then, go to Sakagura right now! & make sure u have the right food with Junmai Dai Gingo!!!
Jessica Y.}Austin, TX}319}156}59}-1}5}5/11/2007}If Decibel were my high school crush, then Sakagura would be my college fling...(See my previous review of Decibel)Sharing the same owner, Decibel and Sakagura, both specializing in sake, are very different.  While Decibel has 70 kinds of sake to taste, Sakagura has a generous 200.  Decibel, surrounded by dark wood,  is casual cool,..  Sakagura, surrounded by golden bamboo, is casual elegance.  Different, yet equally enjoyable, depending on what you prefer.The food is traditional Japanese.  The sashimi super fresh.  Notice the unique tableware.Beautiful decor, great sake..  what more can you ask for?Ikki ikki~!
Sean T.}New York, NY}21}86}64}-1}5}5/1/2007}Recommended for:  Sake lovers, japanese cuisine, lunch/dinner with friends/family, a date.Food 5, Service 5, Ambiance 5.I'm picky about food, service, ambiance, the whole 9, even more so, about my sake, knowing this, my friends organized an outing to this place (though WHY on a sunday night... I have work the next day)...Walk into an unassuming office building, down a flight of stairs, passed the boiler room (feeling sketchy coming on...) and you arrive at this oasis!  Decorated in light woods and earth tones, it is a pleasant visual experience.  Led to the back a table for 6 (later 7) was set up for us.  They have 3 menus, sake, special tasting menu (of sake) and food.  I did not realize this for about, oh 3 minutes... yes, Sean is slow.  I ask around the table if people want dry or sweet, I like dry, and no sooner did we speak our waiter arrives.  I love good service, and I will say our waiter was exceptional!  We started speaking in english, then I thought this is stupid, I'm going to speak in Japanese... we chit chat over sake and soon after he brings two bottles - gotta make everyone happy right?  Glasses are as beautiful as the sake tasted *weeping*We ordered close to oh, 12 dishes (see Jade and Julie photo shoot).  Definitely recommend the flying fish carpaccio, tamago yaki, and my personal fav, the Wagiyu Ishikaya... again, Sean is all about FUN!  Yes, here our waiter first cooked this deliciously fatty tender oh so mouth water mooo; it was so good, I had to get it again, and this time I cooked :)Desserts were also delightful.  While you may be underground you don't feel it.  High ceilings, earth stones, light walls and natural woods and plants make you feel like your in suburban japan - I truly felt at peace.The only gripe I have is the discrimination at the bathroom.  There are guys and girls, both are immaculate but its not fair that the girls get the japanese TOILET!!!!  WTF, I want to have a heated seat, buttons to wash, etc... :(    But seriously, its not a gripe, I just wanted to use it too... though the girls did let me go in and see the room :)Amazing service, sake (we had 3 big bottles) , food (fresh, tasty and delicious), atmosphere, and service, I will definitely be back again... though be wary, if you are eating with me, your bill just might go close to the 4-digit range!Sean Approved:  Zettaini ita houga ii yo!!!
Eugene F.}San Jose, CA}161}668}147}-1}5}4/20/2007}I ate here nearly 3 years ago, and the toro sashimi still comes to mind.  It literally MELTED on my mouth.  As so many other Yelpers have indicated, the location is really obscure.  I mean, how many fabulous restaurants can you find that are located in the basement of a building?  Reservations are a must for this place since it gets super busy.  Also, be ready to fork out some major $.  The quality is impeccable, and the prices show it.
BrasilPo P.}Oakland, CA}100}515}833}-1}5}4/6/2007}An authetic Japanese foodie's gem hidden underneath a nondescript coporate highrise. My favorite? The egg custard soup. Never have I had it so delicate! Definitely get the grilled eggplant served with 3 different sauces. So MANY different CHOICES for your tastebuds!!! We were so stuffed that dessert wasn't an option this time 'round, though the truffles were quite tempting!
Mei L.}NY, NY}15}26}0}-1}4}4/4/2007}To those who bash this place for its price and bird-like quantity but grudgingly admit there's a phenomenal selection of sake: COME HERE FOR LUNCH!!!!As with most authentic Japanese restaurants in Midtown, this place is jammed-packed for lunch with Japanese salary men and women!  Come early, at Noon, and you'll be able to grab a seat.  The lunch boxes/combos are solid, well-portioned, and reasonably priced.  Most importantly, you still get to enjoy the great sake selection.  If wobbling back to work red-faced is a problem, however, try the $9 sake tasting -- you can have two shots of good-quality sake to accompany your lunch.  Beware of the location -- it's buried in the basement of an office building and there are no signs until you enter the building!
Peter A.}Brooklyn, NY}76}224}62}-1}4}2/9/2007}This is a great little hideaway!  Without the sign in the lobby, it took us awhile to find it, just ask the security guard and he's more than happy to point you in the right direction.  Love the homemade noodles and the interesting smaller plates that usually accompany the meal.  Its perfect in terms of portions and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket when you leave.  Desserts were so-so, but I did enjoy the Chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream.  One other perk that I as a man couldn't experience was the electronic japanese toilet in the ladies room.  If its working, definitely give it a spin....I would.
Doron R.}Orlando, FL}71}204}55}-1}3}1/25/2007}I love this place for a first date.  The food is okay, and can get a little eperimental at time (one date called it fear factor).  But, you find out very quickly what kind of person you are with.  I find the more experimental an eater the more fun they are behind closed doors.  So, while this place doesn't thrill with the food, the ambiance (downtown tokyo), decor, and sake make up for it.  The sake list can be daunting, but a great selection.
Brando Calrissian ..}Sunnyvale, CA}237}190}149}-1}4}1/25/2007}A hidden gem. It can be pretty hard to find if you aren't paying attention. I used to spend many afternoons here (on the company's dime of course).You shouldn't come here for the food. Its not bad food but the purpose of Sakagura is the SAKE!You will be overwhelmed by the selection. Someone warned me ahead of time and I thought they were exaggerating. Little did I know they carry any brand/type/style of sake you can imagine.If you are looking for food click here instead yelp.com/biz/7EaiwMVaNdQ…
Mike W.}Los Angeles, CA}12}45}0}-1}5}1/21/2007}Sakagura is truly an amazing spot if you manage to find it. It is located in the basement of an office building and upon entering feels like you've been whisked away to a typical japanese spot in tokyo.  The sake selection is endless and the food is out of this world.  Keep in mind however that izakaya (japanese tapas) tends to serve very small portion and that is consistent with japanese customs because they believe in quality over quantity and they also hate to waste food. If you are a big eater like I am then I suggest the following: 1) be prepared to shell out about $50-60 pp , drinks not included.2) have a light snack before you come here.Don't forget to finish off your meal with their chocolate souffle. it's probably the best i've had in the city.  Cha-an (japanese tea house) in the st-marks area serves desserts straight from sakagura and we'll leave that magnificent tea house for another review, another day.  Overall, a great first date place or business dinner spot and if you are a guy you will definitely impress your date/ associates with this hidden gem. very cosy and casual.
Jen D.}Berlin, Germany}268}1481}274}-1}5}1/8/2007}I've never seen a place in NYC with such an expansive list of sake. A wonderful list and tasting menus too. Traditional Japanese food that was well thought out. Delicious and stayed true to Japanese cuisine. Good place for a date. Intimate and not too noisy.
Melanie M.}Chicago, IL}28}110}87}-1}4}1/3/2007}Basement - sake!Interesting space.  Good for Sake tasting and interesting Japanese cuisine.Not sushi.I felt a little like a CIA agent or an explorer trying to locate the basement residence of this restaurant, but it's well worth the confusion and journey.  If you can, go with someone who has an expense account (like I did) and try everything!It's unlike any other sake experience I had ever had and gave me a completely new understanding of this often abused beverage.  i.e. good sake should never be warmed, bad sake should never be consumed!Adventures with an Expense Account (part I), as series...
mayumi m.}New York, NY}22}74}0}-1}5}12/4/2006}the sake list totally sucked me in to this place..and it totally reminds me of izakaya's in japan. my boyfriend which is a total sake lover was pretty happy with what we got. and even though we went there on the late side(around 11) the staff still treated us very nicely and we didnt feel rushed at all. the food is delicate which matches the complex flavors of the sake. im a fan of the hokkaido area's daijinjyo's and they didnt dissapoint me for giving me more than 4 choices in just that type of sake. i will deffinetly going back for seconds...
Adrienne Y.}San Francisco, CA}58}84}0}-1}4}11/28/2006}i'm not a sake connoisseur, but if i were one, i bet i would really, really dig this place. so many kinds to choose from and on the menu they are categorized by region. my buddy, who is a sake snob, took me here and whatever we had was awesome and smooth...and cold. apparently, only white people are foolish enough to order hot sake. (hey, i am just repeating what i heard.) the fluke was paper thin and delicious. the green tea truffles are soooo yummy too---creamy but not overwhelming. the whole experience of getting here---walking into some generic office building and into what you think would be the parking lot---adds to the whole finding a secret spot vibe. but the cherry on top for me was the bathroom...they have a bidet! woo hoo! definitely make a reservation if you wanna check it out.
John O.}New York, NY}76}71}3}-1}4}11/12/2006}Ventured over last night after hearing about the place from one of the hostesses who also works at Maxie (see review). I used to live in Japan and plenty of great spots were in the basement of buildings or on the upper floors so this brought back pleasent memories of long nights of drinking and eating great pub food. Sakagura is a sake pub with a great selection of snacks, appetizers and main courses. They have plenty of dishes with umeboshi (good for hangovers or hangovers to be!) and some really authentic Japanese food such as ochazuke (a porridge made from rice and other ingredients--often with a green tea broth). Yum! And rice balls, too. (Yaki-onigiri)....The salmon oyako don was delicious. And the tofu was very fresh.The sake list can be overwhelming, but I respect the way they try to make it comprehensible. They also let you sample sakes; which is very helpful. However, they start with the premium ones which are very expensive--good salesmanship--as these are excellent sakes. So, it is very tempting to order them. They also have four different sizes of serving containers, so that's confusing and hard to calculate as the wait staff tries to upsell at all times.I would make a reservation; there seemed to be some confusion about how long it would take for walk ins to be seated. But the hostesses are very nice and gave us a sake list to prepare ourselves.I am planning to go here often for authentic japanese pub food and great sake...though I won't be upsold! (So he says)
Amy Y.}New York, NY}150}121}0}-1}4}11/11/2006}Finally got a chance to try this place out for the first time tonight after hearing so many rave reviews about it.  The restaurant is a little obscure since it's located at the basement of office building #211.  However, the decor and ambiance of the place was spacious, yet cozy.  The waiter/waitress were all very friendly and helpful; in fact, our waitress was a "sake expert", which is no small feat given Sakagura holds over 300 sakes-- the most in the US!  The dishes are served "tapa style", so one would easily need 3-5 orders to feel fulfilled.  On the average, the price tags for each dish ranged from $7-$20.  We asked our waitress for some recommendations (since the menu was pretty dense) and then we winged it with some random dishes.  Unfortunately, we were in a hurry and didn't have time for dessert, but it's definitely on the list for next time.   In conclusion:  Remember the dishes come tapa style and be prepare to drop some serious cash; but that aside, the food did not disappoint and neither did the Sake!
Kristina W.}New York, NY}13}201}17}-1}5}10/9/2006}The atmosphere is great and quality of food is wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed every dish I tried.  I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the cheese tofu, the tuna in the tuna with yam sauce was very good, I also enjoyed the beef cooked on a rock... be sure to keep it on the rare side so it does not overcook.  The meal can be pricey if you have a big appetite but it's well worth it.  If you're not sure about which sake to try, just ask the waiters to recommend a few.
Kevin M.}Philadelphia, PA}25}13}2}-1}5}9/28/2006}Irasshaimase! I'm about 5 weeks back in the US from two years in Japan, and I was positively shocked by the authenticity of Sakagura. The first thing that shocked me is that Sakagura is located in the basement of an office building, directly below the last place I would ever look for a restaurant. And just like Japan, it'd be almost impossible to find without the help of a Japanese person. And this is New York!Their resident sake connoisseur is from the town I lived in while in Japan, and she knows her stuff.  She offered all sorts of different flavors of sake for us to try in our experience there. The food is the exact same stuff you'd find on a menu in Japan, and just as delicious. If you take a look around the place, you'll find lots of great decorations from festivals all over Japan.I can't wait to take my friends who never made it to Japan here to show them what dining in Japan really is!
Celicia C.}New York, NY}21}55}0}-1}5}9/26/2006}i loved every minute of it. it's tucked away in midtown on the bottom most floor of the building, so it's really obscure. but once you get there you realize what a treasure it is. it's mostly Japanese locals and Japanese businessmen, so if you are in the know you should feel special! very authentic, super service, an extensive sake list, and amazing food. we ordered lots of small plates and each one was delish. the only thing i wouldn't order again here is the fried chicken - i still think EN Japanese Brasserie's in west village is the best. but also check out the dessert menu - everything looked soo good! i got the sesame creme brulee - it was so amazing that i ate every last bit. the green tea truffles to take to go are also a treat.
alisa o.}San Francisco, CA}17}64}26}-1}5}9/8/2006}Sakagura has it all - wonderful atmosphere, authentic dishes and a very helpful staff. Please do not confuse it with a restaurant! It falls more under the category of a bar. All of the dishes on the menu accompany a certain type of sake. In Japan these type of establishments are used for a pre-dinner drink, where the main meal comes afterwards in an actual restaurant.
Mona N.}New York, NY}391}210}213}-1}2}8/21/2006}What's with restaurants these days? The quality does not justify the pricing and Sakagura is definitely one of them. The food is typical izakaya style, plated pretty. Attentive plating = jump in price. Sure it's authentic.... only because they offer more than bento box dinners with a side of California rolls. I've been here three times and all three times the food was mediocre with sky high bills. (avg $800 for 4-5 ppl dinner and drinks. no tax or tip) Yes they offer 200+ variations of sake but even as a full blown Japanese, I was confused as shit. I only knew 30% of the sake menu, if that. My heavy drinker friend from Japan was volunteered to order drinks and even he was stuck on stupid. We ended up asking the server for his recommendation and he brought one of the most expensive sakes.... it was fruity. What a disappointment. The second round, we ordered the recommended sakes written next to the dishes on the menu. But that didn't do it for us either. So for the third round and on, we stuck to what we were familiar with... maybe I'm too picky but Sakagura is known for its sake selection. And the website is all about the 200+ varieties of sake. If that's what they market, I expect my experience to be exceptional and unfortunately it wasn't. I went back a second and third time to triple check if our particular server was new or the chef wasn't on his game and/or other factors that contributes to unsatisfactory dining experiences but all three times practically mirrored my first. Unremarkable food, high bill, below average sake experience. Needless to say, this is one place I will never return to. Even if someone else is paying for my dinner... wait, for free food maybe I'll go. Maybe.     p.s. since i ranted like a raging sake expert (which i'm definitely not. my full japanese parents are border line alchoholics. sake know-how was naturally instilled) i'll end this with a few tips. sake is just like wine. personal preference, temp, various types and bodies are factored into the experience so i'm not going to make any recommendations. what i can say with 110% confidence is hot house sake is equivalent to carlos rossi. that 10 dollar a jug cooking wine? if you've never tried it consider yourselves lucky. not to mention how much i envy you for not ever being a broke as a joke alkie like me. but i digress. avoid the hot house sake as your main drink unless massive hangovers and yacking like crazy is your thing.  the end. jeez this is long
Thomas L.}Los Angeles, CA}28}30}0}-1}5}8/20/2006}Sakagura, hidden away in the basement of a Midtown office building, lures enthusiasts to its subterranean locale with over 200 sakes. In addition to sake, a large menu offers traditional Japanese foods, such as onigiri and edamame, and unique Japanese fare, such as mashed potatoes fried in donut batter. Luckily, the sake menu amply descrbes the  different sake, making it easy for the sake newbie to confidently order a glass.
Kevin L.}Seattle, WA}44}104}2}-1}4}8/17/2006}Best sake I've ever had.  Hands down.  You have to have your wits about you to find this place the first time around.  There's a red herring Japanese restaurant above ground right near this address.  Walk in there, and a weaker will done for.  But if you see salarymen wafting out of an office building tipsy, follow their footprints back to Sakagura.A friend of mine who lived in Tokyo for 3 years got homesick for his old izakayas here.  A mishap of spillage ruined one of our dishes, and they were polite and replaced it lickety split.  Karage is hard to mess up, and they do a good job here.  Daikon-based salad was delicious while it still had dressing, but it ran out quick.  But yes, you come here for the glasses of sake.  Ask for guidance with the types, and they are quite helpful (or so I think, my friend and the waiter were giggling it up in Japanesey)
Megan C.}New York, NY}3880}816}840}18}3}8/14/2006}IF YOU:1.  EAT LIKE A BIRD 2.  WANT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD SPIN WHILE READING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAKE  (sober or drunk it will spin), 3.  WANT TO SNEAK DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT OF AN UNASSUMING OFFICE BUILDING (Boiler room?? Japanese style) CONGRATS! YOU'VE FOUND IT! THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!Perhaps it's authentic but if you're hungry then you will need to order approximately 6-10 dishes each. At $16-24 per dish with some very small bites around $5-9   you should be in the mood to lightly snack or not care about how much the bill will be once it arrives.  Either way there are many other restaurants at this level that I would suggest going to first.  Fresh yes, but tasty... stick with the sake and nibbling if you must venture here. The first (unfiltered) sake that we had was okay, but the second filtered that the waiter suggested was phenomenal.  The miso cod was exceptional but would need to order 5 helpings of it if you wanted to make a meal of it. The other dishes however, left quite a bit to be desired.   Even the beef on the hot rock was "so-so."Romance Factor:  7Hobnob Potential:  2Destination Rating:  6The last time I used Yelp to find a great restaurant it proved to be worthy of all it's Yelp Stars.  This one honestly did not come close. So hopefully my two stars will help bring down the over all Yelp Rating. I honestly might give it 3 and say that it depends on who is with you.
Lindsay M.}Los Angeles, CA}38}117}3}-1}5}8/11/2006}Went here for the first time last week and had a fabulous time. The portion size / price combo makes it expensive if you're really hungry, but we went for a late dinner. This is perfect place if you basically want to nibble some delicious treats while taking full advantage of the sake options. I will be going back. The tuna tartare was my favorite dish of the night.Oh, and the chocolate souffle was definitely the best dessert (we tried almost all of them).
Caterina F.}San Francisco, CA}53}16}5}-1}5}8/1/2006}Hidden down in the basement level of an office building, with great izakaya and a tremendous selection of sake. Loved the Beef Back Ribs, Sashimi and the Siu Mai, as well as the Black Sesame Creme Brulee. I'm not a sake expert, but the wait staff was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending a fantastic sake.
j c.}New York, NY}17}125}0}-1}5}7/19/2006}This relatively hidden spot in the basement of an office building (am I going into a boiler room?) has the best Japanese food I've had in this neighborhood so far. The food is very good, with muted nuanced flavors that don't disguise the original ingredients (I have a low threshold for overmarinated/seasoned food), and of course there are the requisite lunch specials, some with soba - perfect for summer. In the evening (Sakagura is open until 2 a.m. on weekends), the izakaya dishes and desserts are amazing - impeccable presentation and intriguing flavors, especially the black sesame seed creme brulee. Izakaya dishes run about $5-$15. The space itself is surprisingly nice for a basement, and is perfect for a low-key evening of sake tasting. Should I have to live in a bomb shelter for the rest of my life, I would be only too happy to eat here everyday.
George B.}Sunnyside, NY}24}183}312}-1}5}6/19/2006}Most previous reviews really summarize this fantastic Japanese spot.  This sake list has yet to be beat in NYC and the food is a great match for drinking.  Just two items I'd like to add:  first, for those friends you bring not interested in sake, there's a nice selection of sake cocktails which are divine; second, Saka Gura hosts a number of tastings throughout the year.  My favorite is the spring sake tasting, though they do sponsor tastings from a variety of producers and areas to give the novice a better nose.  Their special sessions are quite reasonably priced!Enjoy!
camilla c.}New York, NY}171}336}1}-1}5}5/8/2006}Probably the best sake selection you'll find anywhere around here.  In this hidden underground gem of a place, you'll not only find a great variety of sake but also authentic Japanese fare (most of which are perfect accompaniment for sake), awesome dessert (as Yoko I. pointed out, the green tea and strawberry truffles and the black sesame creme brulee are amazing), helpful knowledgeable service, and a cool, romantic vibe.  The location is unassuming (basement of an overly bright office bldg in a fairly quiet block, but ideally right across from Sushi Yasuda) and the menu can be somewhat overwhelming with the unfamiliar but that's the fun of this place.  I'm no sake connoisseur but Sakagura will inspire you to become one!
Larry L.}New York, NY}69}61}75}-1}4}2/27/2006}The menu may have some common izakaya elements but if you dig deeper you'll find some tasty eats. Try the Buta Kakuni. It's priced per piece but you won't need more than one. The menu on menupages doesn't do any justice.Sakagura recently ran a special on shochu, but the real treat is going to one of their special sake tastings. They'll offer 40+ sakes and a menu of traditional Japanese eats that'll make you think you're trying dishes made by the Ohta faction on Iron Chef. The original, of course.It doesn't hurt to call ahead - once in a while the restaurant is closed for private functions.
